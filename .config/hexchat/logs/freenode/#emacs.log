Apr 22 22:18:28 <mbrumlow>	I am aware of the read one, but the write one is confusing because on blocking IO my man page said that it will be 0, or all of the buffer, unless a unrecoverable error happens.

Apr 22 22:22:03 <mbrumlow>	once you are in the write syscall to a blocking file -- a signal can't stop you. 
Apr 22 22:22:26 <mbrumlow>	Only on non blocking file handles can write decide to write some and return. 
Apr 22 22:22:36 <mbrumlow>	With the one exception on blocking handles -- no more space. 
Apr 22 22:22:42 <mbrumlow>	or out of quota. 
Apr 22 22:23:06 <mbrumlow>	None of those are "fixable" in such that you can just retry your write continuing where you left off. 
Apr 22 22:23:18 *	jlf- (~jlf@pdpc/supporter/active/jlf) has joined
Apr 22 22:23:43 <mbrumlow>	So for write retries on blocking IO you really should only need to resend the entire write command on EINTR. 
Apr 22 22:24:54 <bpalmer>	mbrumlow: I'm slightly skeptical; I see the note that the function returns -1 with errno=EINTR only when EINTR happens before any data is written.

Apr 22 22:25:53 <bpalmer>	mbrumlow: I believe without thinking too hard about it that if you try to write() more data than, e.g., fits in a single TCP packet with a file descriptor bound to a tcp socket, you'll risk being interrupted partway through.
Apr 22 22:26:11 <mbrumlow>	yeah, but writing to sockets is different. 
Apr 22 22:26:24 <bpalmer>	no it isn't. write only cares about file descriptors
Apr 22 22:26:47 <mbrumlow>	The man page calls out fd that refer to sockets differently.

Apr 22 22:28:37 <tyrese`>	Keep it physically on disk - don't actually load it when emacs starts. Mostly to just trim emacs down so there isn't a bunch of stuff I never use in ivy etc
Apr 22 22:29:04 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: this is what autoloads accomplish (which are used extensively by emacs)
Apr 22 22:29:44 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: an autoload function is a stub that, when called, actually loads the library which then replaces the stub with the real code (and calls it)
Apr 22 22:30:00 <tyrese`>	oh, that's interesting 
Apr 22 22:30:15 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: if you are installing packages from elpa, melpa, etc, use-package automates some of the work for you.
Apr 22 22:30:24 <bpalmer>	or, *can* automate some of it.
Apr 22 22:30:26 <paluche>	of course, that stubbed function will show up in e.g. M-x
Apr 22 22:30:38 <wasamasa>	tyrese`: you can experiment with the new pdump feature to make an emacs only preloading the things you need
Apr 22 22:30:40 <bpalmer>	if it's marked as interactive, yes.

Apr 22 22:36:03 <xtifr>	The stubbed autoload function *itself* shows up in C-h/M-x/etc., but all sorts of related functions won't until the module is properly loaded. Which can sometimes be bizarre if you are looking for a documented function that hasn't actually been loaded yet--especially if it was there the last time you ran emacs. :)

Apr 22 22:45:41 <Snowbear>	Freed up about 100 gigs from my drive doing it.
Apr 22 22:45:47 <Snowbear>	yeah I had notmuch and mbsync before.
Apr 22 22:45:58 <Snowbear>	but I uninstalled them and deleted all the mail stores
Apr 22 22:46:05 <Snowbear>	so ~/Mail is totally empty atm
Apr 22 22:46:19 <parsnip>	okay, but i mean, if you go to the webmail in chrome/firefox, are you sure there's no evidence of copying
Apr 22 22:46:22 <parsnip>	Snowbear: ^
Apr 22 22:46:29 <Snowbear>	yeah absolutely.
Apr 22 22:46:33 <Snowbear>	I use it all the time at the moment.
Apr 22 22:47:00 <parsnip>	Snowbear: okay, and if you only have Gnus setup with a single imap, is there no evidence of copying?
Apr 22 22:47:00 <Snowbear>	I use airmail on my phone but it never has conflated my multiple accounts.
Apr 22 22:47:13 <Snowbear>	i don't know how I would check for that.
Apr 22 22:47:18 <parsnip>	Snowbear: did you test on a computer web browser, like gmail.com
Apr 22 22:47:28 <Snowbear>	yeah I can go there right now again. hang on

Apr 22 22:48:11 <xtifr>	npostavs: ivy's completion isn't anchored at the start of the string, so that could get messy
Apr 22 22:48:14 <parsnip>	rudybot: whatever can go wrong, will go wrong
Apr 22 22:48:17 <rudybot>	parsnip: I used to use a router with the linux router thing on it. whatever that's called. but I worry about doing that. when things go wrong it's tough.
Apr 22 22:48:59 <Snowbear>	Yeah there's literally no evidence of that in my web gmail accounts.
Apr 22 22:49:03 <Snowbear>	I just checked.
Apr 22 22:49:45 <xtifr>	Type "g" and ivy loads every module which *might* match the letter "g"? That wouldn't be good, to say the least...

Apr 22 22:50:50 <Snowbear>	I'm at a loss too. 
Apr 22 22:51:02 <Snowbear>	If I load all mail on one account, I get all mail on all accounts.
Apr 22 22:51:13 <parsnip>	Snowbear: i suspect you did something funny with your mbsync or offlineimap configs, and it's leaving behind traces that are not obvious in the webmail app
Apr 22 22:51:30 *	techquila has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
Apr 22 22:51:35 <Snowbear>	hrm
Apr 22 22:51:52 <Snowbear>	well mbsync is off my machine completely.
Apr 22 22:52:00 <Snowbear>	So that can't be a culprit
Apr 22 22:52:01 <parsnip>	that does not conflict with my statement
Apr 22 22:52:22 <Snowbear>	the only thing i have running is msmtp and I know that's configured correctly because it worked flawlessly with notmuch.
Apr 22 22:52:34 <Snowbear>	hrm
Apr 22 22:52:37 <Snowbear>	how would I check for that?
Apr 22 22:53:03 <parsnip>	i can think of a few tedious things that might help probe, but i'm not sure if they'll find anything
Apr 22 22:53:04 *	_g_p_ (~user@static-3-150-225-77.ipcom.comunitel.net) has joined
Apr 22 22:53:19 <xtifr>	but still, "cal" would match both "calc" and "calendar", so ivy would have to load both, whereas with regular builtin completion, it won't load any modules until I actually press tab.
Apr 22 22:53:21 <wasamasa>	meh, I can't make the hack work on shell even
Apr 22 22:53:28 <wasamasa>	why is everything involving buffers such a mess
Apr 22 22:53:37 <Snowbear>	okay
Apr 22 22:53:38 <parsnip>	i guess there's some way to ping imap with telnet?
Apr 22 22:53:45 <wasamasa>	the thing emacs is supposed to be good at is such a frustration
Apr 22 22:53:59 <Snowbear>	I honestly have no idea.
Apr 22 22:54:02 <parsnip>	Snowbear: first, check if the imap issue only appears in gnus. try thunderbird and/or mutt

Apr 22 22:54:33 <Snowbear>	but I'll install mutt tomorrow and see.
Apr 22 22:54:41 <parsnip>	lol, "i have a question and i'm going to bed"
Apr 22 22:54:45 <Snowbear>	No no
Apr 22 22:54:58 <Snowbear>	I posted it there in the hopes that somebody would answer it overnight
Apr 22 22:55:13 <parsnip>	i kind of recommend thunderbird first, i feel it will go faster to give some indication
Apr 22 22:55:20 <Snowbear>	Okay. I can do that.
Apr 22 22:55:22 <Snowbear>	Thank you. :)
Apr 22 22:55:34 <Snowbear>	I didn't know thunderird was still a thing. I thought they closed the project years and years ago.
Apr 22 22:55:39 <parsnip>	but generally, when futzing with imap, mbsync, offlineimap, i recommend having mutt setup too
Apr 22 22:55:49 <parsnip>	i might have said this to you a week ago
Apr 22 22:56:04 <Snowbear>	Maybe. I don't remmeber. I did get notmuch to work, and it really worked well.
Apr 22 22:56:19 <Snowbear>	except it doesn't sync deleted messages and it's incredibly difficult to do so...

Apr 23 01:34:10 <jcob>	but it helps you out so you dont have to write frees at the bottom of everything
Apr 23 01:34:23 <jcob>	(and doesnt have all the C++ cruft)
Apr 23 01:34:24 <oni-on-ion>	i really like it. but the ::'s and the something().unwrap().unbox().borrow()   is a bit hefty

Apr 23 01:40:18 <jcob>	now writing c++ is practically cheating with valgrind, gdb, clang static analyzer (seriously clang static analyzer is some wizard $hit)
Apr 23 01:40:30 <oni-on-ion>	most people saying bad rep of c++ is because of the 90s afaik
Apr 23 01:40:45 <oni-on-ion>	oh yeah? is it like type inference  stuff ?
Apr 23 01:41:07 <jcob>	oh no i mean it goes through your code and tells you potential problems (uninitialized values, unfreed mem etc)
Apr 23 01:41:24 <jcob>	it can follow tons of branches and figure out stuff you would have never have thought of

Apr 23 05:42:11 <cjb>	codingquark: G'day! :)
Apr 23 05:42:21 *	cjb is slow today
Apr 23 05:42:24 <twb>	I don't know about modern VNC clients, but I assume they have an equivalent
Apr 23 05:43:15 <parsnip>	i'm guessing this is partly a case of, "i am quite comfortable in lisp"
Apr 23 05:43:16 <xristos>	mbrumlow: it's a combination of things
Apr 23 05:43:18 <xristos>	Emacs GC is terrible
Apr 23 05:43:23 <xristos>	term.el is terrible
Apr 23 05:43:32 <xristos>	as in the code sucks and it's not written with performance in mind
Apr 23 05:44:05 <xristos>	i bet someone well-versed elisp optimization could write a terminal emulator that's 2-3x faster than ansi-term
Apr 23 05:44:26 <mbrumlow>	twb: the problem is the config is on the remote system, the backstory is I have a huge ball of json sitting on the screen, and I either have to copy and paste it to the local system to view formatted, or try my best to sort it out on the terminal to find the prot, and the password. 
Apr 23 05:44:30 <xristos>	in fact i started doing that myself some time ago but i never found the inspiration to finish it ;p
Apr 23 05:44:47 <twb>	haha you're parsing json using regexps?
Apr 23 05:44:49 <parsnip>	xristos: i guess they'd have to know a lot about terminals and shells too
Apr 23 05:45:13 <mbrumlow>	xristos: I messed around with term.el abunch, I am not sure any amount of changing of the lisp is going to fix it. 
Apr 23 05:45:23 <twb>	xristos: I think they'd actually be better to know about terminal optimization than elisp optimization :-)
Apr 23 05:45:24 <xristos>	mbrumlow: it needs a complete rewrite
Apr 23 05:45:32 <mbrumlow>	xristos: not even then. 
Apr 23 05:45:52 <twb>	e.g. dalias
Apr 23 05:45:55 <xristos>	well it's still going to be slow compared to a native terminal emulator
Apr 23 05:45:55 <mbrumlow>	xristos:I broke it down to the smallest one could, just the process, and the filter, only handling new lines ans scrolling. 
Apr 23 05:46:10 <mbrumlow>	xristos: and it was still just as slow. 
Apr 23 05:46:14 <xristos>	mbrumlow: we've had this discussion before
Apr 23 05:46:16 <twb>	But what does term.el get you?  NOTHING, except that the terminal window lives inside emacs's frame instead of being a separate X window
Apr 23 05:46:18 *	codingquark offers a few pages containing latest manifestos produced by political parties of India for the elections

Apr 23 05:49:05 <mbrumlow>	xristos: maybe I was idk, eshell simple test seems fast enough. 
Apr 23 05:49:23 <xristos>	mbrumlow: process filters are everywhere in Emacs
Apr 23 05:49:25 <mbrumlow>	oni-on-ion: I am in exwm :/ 
Apr 23 05:49:28 <xristos>	if they were slow you'd know it ;p
Apr 23 05:50:15 <parsnip>	interesting to be in exam and _still_ not want to use a dedicated terminal
Apr 23 05:50:23 <mbrumlow>	xristos: I was not making a claim it is the filter.

Apr 23 05:55:10 <mbrumlow>	eshell is keeping a much larger buffer
Apr 23 05:56:07 <twb>	xristos: getting useful problem reports out of mbrumlow is difficult
Apr 23 05:56:38 <mbrumlow>	xristos: right now I am just timing dmesg -- not very exciting. 
Apr 23 05:57:12 <xristos>	mbrumlow: yes so eshell doesn't do terminal emulation so there's a whole layer of additional processing for _each character_ that term.el needs to do

Apr 23 06:00:15 <codingquark>	twb: congress says they'll give 6k monthly to the people below poverty line.

Apr 23 06:00:24 <mbrumlow>	xristos: so I can avoid the slowdown over time issue by setting term-buffer-maximum-size to zero. Not entirely though, there is some slowdown that gets reset after GC. 
Apr 23 06:00:25 <codingquark>	For no work
Apr 23 06:00:37 <twb>	codingquark: should give it to everyone instead of means testing

Apr 23 06:00:58 <twb>	mbrumlow: nope
Apr 23 06:01:01 <codingquark>	No
Apr 23 06:01:16 <xristos>	twb: that seems like a bad idea
Apr 23 06:01:19 <codingquark>	Do you know Indian poverty?
Apr 23 06:01:19 <xristos>	anyway i'm going to sleep 
Apr 23 06:01:24 <twb>	mbrumlow: it means people will look after babies or work in soup kitchens or make paintings, instead of doing make-work crap jobs
Apr 23 06:01:29 <mbrumlow>	Oh, start a fight with UBI then leave... 
Apr 23 06:02:01 <twb>	mbrumlow: and if we still need someone so e.g. clean toilets, then they'll do that so they can get extra money to buy an xbox
Apr 23 06:02:02 <mbrumlow>	twb: their babies, or other peoples babies? 
Apr 23 06:02:06 <twb>	mbrumlow: either
Apr 23 06:02:30 <twb>	currently looking after your own baby is basically not considered part of the economy, because nobody pays you to do it
Apr 23 06:02:32 <codingquark>	India has this thing called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005
Apr 23 06:02:40 <mbrumlow>	twb: what is the poverty line? That is the main issue I have. I think things like UBI might work, but only if *everybody* gets them. 
Apr 23 06:03:11 <twb>	mbrumlow: that's why it's called "universal"
Apr 23 06:03:12 <mbrumlow>	twb: If there is a cutoff, then sometimes it might be better simply to not work because you will pop over that line for 100, and loose out on 6000 
Apr 23 06:03:24 <twb>	mbrumlow: that is exactly the argument against means testing
Apr 23 06:03:30 <mbrumlow>	twb: Sorry, I am referring to codingquark: thing.
Apr 23 06:03:44 <codingquark>	You really need to look at it from India's perspective. Where a poor family means they don't have clothes to wear, no schools to go to. Where they literally die of hunger.
Apr 23 06:03:46 <mbrumlow>	Where they will give 6k to people below. 
Apr 23 06:04:01 <twb>	"poverty line" is routinely criticized by academia because there is not a magical difference between "I live on $2/day" and "I live on $2.01/day"
Apr 23 06:04:16 <mbrumlow>	twb: Seems we are on the same page now -- well at least I am now. You were on the page already. 
Apr 23 06:04:39 <twb>	:-)
Apr 23 06:04:58 <twb>	codingquark: we have the same thing in australia, it's just not talked about
Apr 23 06:05:15 <twb>	like there's 200,000 homeless people in melbourne
Apr 23 06:05:22 <codingquark>	Say this family is able to earn like 1200. Then the govt will give 4800
Apr 23 06:05:52 <codingquark>	twb: I see. How bad is it?
Apr 23 06:06:02 <twb>	codingquark: but that means you have to have officers who decide how much they are really earning
Apr 23 06:06:11 <twb>	codingquark: to make sure it's 1200 and not 1200 + 300 cash
Apr 23 06:06:30 <twb>	codingquark: if you just give *everyone* 6000, regardless, it's much easier, and you don't get weird edge cases
Apr 23 06:06:43 <codingquark>	That is true
Apr 23 06:06:48 <twb>	codingquark: e.g. "I am getting 6000 for doing nothing, but if I get a job for 6500 I have to work all day"
Apr 23 06:06:56 <mbrumlow>	Unless you don't have 6000 to give to everybody... 
Apr 23 06:07:14 *	cjb has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Apr 23 06:07:31 <twb>	And giving everyone 6000 doesn't cost much more compared to e.g. mining tax cuts that are already done to keep rich people rich
Apr 23 06:07:41 <twb>	looking at you, Adani corporation...
Apr 23 06:08:04 <mbrumlow>	codingquark: I have been to India -- at least the parts I was in it did not seem like anybody would be starving. Shitty living conditions? Sure, but food did not really seem like it was an issue.
Apr 23 06:08:48 <codingquark>	Yeah, you haven't seen India.
Apr 23 06:09:02 <twb>	mbrumlow: india is huge and e.g. SC/ST population is different in each state
Apr 23 06:09:26 <twb>	It's like saying "I went to NYC in 1925 and I didn't see ANY okies"
Apr 23 06:09:34 <mbrumlow>	Also, my gauge was probably a shitty one.
Apr 23 06:10:02 <twb>	codingquark: the main concern with UBI, I think, is if one country has it but the next country over doesn't, so you get edge cases there
Apr 23 06:10:26 <mbrumlow>	I tend to judge these things by the number of fat dogs laying in the streets. 1) If the dog is able to get fat, then there is spare food. 2) If you were really hungry, there might be no dog :/ 
Apr 23 06:10:47 <twb>	codingquark: but even when that happens, it's happening to individual humans, who have a limit on how much they can abuse the system.  Compare with multinationals moving one country over to get 20% less corporate tax, who can abuse the system enough to kill entire cities

Apr 23 07:23:20 <Snowbear>	oh and I put "install mutt" on my todo list today as per your suggestion
Apr 23 07:23:31 <fourier_mode>	A bit off-topic, but what is exactly the advantage of TUI email clients over GUI ones i.e. is it worth the switch?

Some highly regarded emacs users use GNUS but I believe they all retrieve gmail in a separate, offline process."
Apr 23 07:25:38 <parsnip>	twb: right, as Snowbear reiterates, i suggested thunderbird as a user-friendly way to quickly test some issue Snowbear describes.
Apr 23 07:25:56 <parsnip>	twb: that way, he doesn't have to be spoon fed special commands or configs >.<
Apr 23 07:25:59 <twb>	Because IMAP is slow and Emacs isn't (historically) multi-threaded, doing gnus -> imap.gmail.com was historically STRONGLY contra-indicated.  To the point that jgoerzen wrote "offlineimap" to allow gnus to talk to a local nnmaildir or nnimap

Apr 30 16:04:40 <parsnip>	i actually stopped letting one of the dogs annoy me, because it at least reduced somewhat in frequency, and i don't expect much out of the owner, given their demeanor
Apr 30 16:05:02 <parsnip>	but the other neighbor that does fine, i feel like he should know how to figure it out
Apr 30 16:05:58 <parsnip>	competent affluent people should work it out
Apr 30 16:06:04 <TDT>	Some people may need to just be informed.  Some though take that very offensively.  It's kinda annoying.  I have one neighbor like that.  most are good, but one seems to be highly offended at even the sight of me, let alone if i try to talk with her
Apr 30 16:07:16 <bpalmer>	Some dog breeds are designed to bark. (This may mean that they're not good in, say, a city environment). For example, I think Great Pyrenees look like great dogs, but would only consider getting one in the countryside

Apr 30 16:10:36 <TDT>	yeah, some people use dogs as protection, and the louder ones work for that.  My cousin has a giant dog that is...well, mean, very mean, at least in my opinion.  He got the dog to protect his daughters as they were growing up.  I get that, but it's one of about a dozen reasons why I don't visit them ever.

May 18 19:52:43 <ieure>	Unlikely
May 18 19:52:59 <wasamasa>	the difference is the amount of people looking at it

May 18 19:56:32 <wasamasa>	yes, we love to make fun of stupid breakage when someone doesn't think through a npm module release, but honestly, do you prefer having a byte-code compiler as your linter or a handful of competing external linters with configurable rules and ever-expanding features like fixing up your code and rewriting it?
May 18 19:56:56 <wasamasa>	alternatively, take a look at what php went through

May 18 20:03:47 <wasamasa>	anyway, I don't have any illusions regarding it

May 18 20:04:24 <xenodasein>	I tried a  feature in Visual Studio and wonder if it could be simulated in emacs: when you press C-<TAB> a list of currently open files appear and as you keep pressing the control button you can select between the list items using tab or arrow keys. When you *release* the control the current item is selected and selection thingy is closed.
May 18 20:04:38 <wasamasa>	nope

May 18 20:04:40 <xenodasein>	So the main problem is how can we use the control key which is a modifier  with emacs in this manner, or if it is possible at all?
May 18 20:04:44 <wasamasa>	it isn't
May 18 20:04:51 <johnjay>	is emacs on freebsd?
May 18 20:04:53 <wasamasa>	currently emacs supports this only for the mouse events

May 18 20:05:17 *	tiwula has quit (Quit: Leaving)
May 18 20:05:19 <wasamasa>	and considerable thought about how to expose it in lisp
May 18 20:06:31 <wasamasa>	you could maybe do a terrible hack like a program on the X/wayland/AHK/... level that detects such events and sends a special key sequence to inform emacs that a modifier has been pressed and released again
May 18 20:06:51 <wasamasa>	this fits in beautifully into the above discussion why elisp rocks and sucks at the same time
May 18 20:07:05 <offby1>	worse is better
May 18 20:07:14 <wasamasa>	it rocks because you can try out such things with relatively little effort, it sucks because it's an absolute pain to pull it off
May 18 20:07:48 <xenodasein>	I suppose that functionality could be done using some non-modifier key, using a timer hack for key release?
May 18 20:08:33 <wasamasa>	well, it doesn't need to be a timer hack
May 18 20:08:39 <wasamasa>	I did such a thing for chip8.el
May 18 20:08:46 <xenodasein>	nice
May 18 20:08:47 <wasamasa>	it's not exactly nice, but it works
May 18 20:09:10 <wasamasa>	the emulated platform has opcodes to query whether a key is pressed or not

Jun 13 21:49:13 <MrFantastik>	I'm gonna have to play with this
Jun 13 21:50:34 <dale>	ediff is kind of intimidating the first time you use it.
Jun 13 21:50:48 <dale>	And also subsequent times you use it.
Jun 13 21:51:15 <MrFantastik>	it looks like it could work for what I'm doing though
Jun 13 21:51:20 <TreyHarris>	I'm confused what y'all are talking about when you say "logical hunks"... I use logical hunks carefully to commit, but to merge? That sounds very strange to me. If you've made your commits discrete logical hunks, you should be able to rebase and/or use rerere (which you have to break out of magit for unfortunately); then you'll only get at worst empty conflicts whose only merge requirements are agreeing to the
Jun 13 21:51:22 <TreyHarris>	conflict resolution by hitting 's' on the unstaged empty hunk
Jun 13 21:52:03 <MrFantastik>	TreyHarris: sometimes I'm comitting three months of changes to my dotfiles in one commit

Jun 13 21:53:17 <TreyHarris>	MrFantastik: oh. If it's dotfiles, then presumably no one else is synced up with your remotes, so you can go to the original branch and split a commit using interactive rebase
Jun 13 21:53:42 <TreyHarris>	That's much cleaner than picking out hunks from an existing commit to apply
Jun 13 21:54:22 <TreyHarris>	The thing that keeps people from doing that is because they're sharing branch state with others, and once you've pushed, you should never rewrite history in the same branch
Jun 13 21:54:23 <MrFantastik>	mmmk I'll give that a shot

I've noticed that the package `ascii` has been removed from CRAN, maybe this has

Jun 14 12:45:20 <dired>	is it possible to open new window in dired (C-o) to the left of the frame (rather than to the right - which keep dired listing to the left)?
Jun 14 12:46:01 <dired>	so that i don't have to swap windows manually everytime :-)

Jun 14 16:11:11 <twainwek>	dale: yes, it does after jedi:setup under ~/.emacs.d/.python-environments/default
Jun 14 16:11:15 <dale>	twainwek: Also FWIW, I think I'm almost always using Python 2.

Jun 14 16:16:44 <subopt>	npostavs: Yes, i asked the question wrong. Found the solution though: directory-abbrev-alist
Jun 14 16:18:22 <subopt>	Is there a way to use env vars when directing `find-file` to the file you want?

Jun 14 16:29:28 <dale>	twainwek: Your #1256 was reportedly a duplicate of my https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1242, and for that one it just took me doing approximately anything in Emacs with Python for a few minutes in order to reproduce that issue.

Jun 14 16:33:58 <dale>	twainwek: It is interesting that you say you're having this problem while running in a virtual environment, since setting the virtual environment environment variables was the fix for #1242 IIUC.

If the photon gets absorbed and re-emitted then you will not see a very shiny-looking surface as there will be other detection events possible from other paths; this is a natural consequence of "a photon stays over in this state for a time, then the

Jun 16 21:31:08 <npostavs>	xtifr: you mean emacs -nw can make a transparent terminal opaque?  That seems a bit strange to me
Jun 16 21:31:27 <xtifr>	I agree, I had to try it to believe it
Jun 16 21:31:33 <gpk>	xtifr: it does, but I use a theme, and the theme gets applied and make the background opaque again
Jun 16 21:31:55 <gpk>	It works with emacs -Q -nq
Jun 16 21:31:57 <gpk>	-nw
Jun 16 21:32:00 <gpk>	I mean
Jun 16 21:32:13 <gpk>	But with a theme.. it goes back to being opaque
Jun 16 21:33:01 <xtifr>	also confirmed
Jun 16 21:33:09 <xtifr>	quite odd, I must say
Jun 16 21:33:29 <gpk>	I can make the whole frame translucent with sway, but that's not great because then the text is translucent too

Jun 16 21:34:26 <npostavs>	Isn't this a bug in the terminal?
Jun 16 21:34:46 <gpk>	Not sure
Jun 16 21:35:03 <gpk>	If emacs is sending it opaque colour codes then it's unclear what the terminal should do
Jun 16 21:35:15 <gpk>	And I think that is what is happening
Jun 16 21:35:32 *	devroomdog has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jun 16 21:35:58 <gpk>	And in fact I'm sure that is what is happening because it happens for other programs
Jun 16 21:36:14 <gpk>	The parts of htop that do have a background colour for example
Jun 16 21:36:18 *	igemnace has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.5)
Jun 16 21:36:49 <gpk>	So I suppose a solutoin could be to not set the background colour in the theme
Jun 16 21:36:59 <npostavs>	"opaque colour codes"? why is that a thing? Shouldn't all background colours be translucent?
Jun 16 21:37:27 <xtifr>	'TERM=xterm emacs -nw' works
Jun 16 21:37:40 <gpk>	Hah, OK, it was as easy as that
Jun 16 21:37:44 <xtifr>	so apparently it's a 256-color-term thing
Jun 16 21:37:48 <gpk>	I just remove the :background frmo the theme
Jun 16 21:38:32 <gpk>	xtifr: that doesn't work for the theme I'm using

Jun 16 23:30:08 <daniele->	yrk: what was the GFDL designed for? the GFDL with the invariant sections is not even DFSG compatible... i think that many see the invariant section clause as a bad idea nowadays
Jun 16 23:31:15 <yrk>	daniele-: the gfdl wasn't designed to be dfsg compatible. and there is stuff debian do that isn't fsf compatible. what's the point?
Jun 16 23:31:42 <yrk>	daniele-: these are two organizations who place difference emphasis on particular points; that's fine
Jun 16 23:31:51 <yrk>	daniele-: but that doesn't say anything about the gfdl
Jun 16 23:32:04 <daniele->	yrk: what's the design choice that makes the invariant sections a good idea?
Jun 16 23:32:37 <xtifr>	or making "chmod -r" illegal a good idea?
Jun 16 23:32:51 <yrk>	daniele-: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html#SEC1
Jun 16 23:33:38 <yrk>	daniele-: "good idea" intimates that there is an objective truth here. there isn't. if you don't think something is a good idea... there is a name for that. it is called opinion.
Jun 16 23:33:42 <daniele->	yrk: that made a little sense when the primary form of consuming the licensed material was in printed form
Jun 16 23:33:53 <yrk>	daniele-: how so?
Jun 16 23:34:22 <yrk>	daniele-: I'm speaking as a gnu maintainer who has never had a lick of trouble with the gfdl... and constantly wonders what the big deal it about
Jun 16 23:34:40 <daniele->	yrk: because the text was there for you to find it without serarching for it. now that invariant section on the emacs manual online is mostly wasted bits
Jun 16 23:35:37 <yrk>	daniele-: wasted bits?! the javascript on the smallest webpage you've ever loaded into a modern browser is 100 time larger
Jun 16 23:35:41 <daniele->	yrk: i have no troubles with it, i'm just saying that the invariant senctions make it complicated for very little gain, if any
Jun 16 23:35:50 <yrk>	daniele-: that's your problem!?
Jun 16 23:36:02 <daniele->	yrk: i don't have any problem

Jun 16 23:41:50 <yrk>	daniele-: it wasn't printed in a manual. it was a part of the docs inside emacs
Jun 16 23:41:56 <daniele->	yrk: don't get me wrong, my journey is probably very similar to yours
Jun 16 23:42:10 <ozzloy>	ie "don't make it look like my personal opinion is something other than this."
Jun 16 23:42:21 <ozzloy>	seems like a personally reasonable thing to be able to do
Jun 16 23:42:21 <yrk>	ozzloy: I honest have no idea. people _love_ to hate invariant sections without every, and I do mean ever, having an actual problem with them
Jun 16 23:42:52 <yrk>	oh no! my software project burst into flames. darn you, invariant sections!
Jun 16 23:43:00 <ozzloy>	heh
Jun 16 23:43:30 <yrk>	ozzloy: but there are also people who feel that nothing should be ND, to use creative commons' nomenclature
Jun 16 23:43:50 <yrk>	ozzloy: I get their argument, but I personally don't subscribe to it
Jun 16 23:45:16 <yrk>	daniele-: so just because we two don't need to read the invariant sections in a gnu manual about software freedom anymore, doesn't mean that a kid in Bangladesh, Mogadishu, or some other place should be denied them.
Jun 16 23:45:37 <daniele->	yrk: as i already expressed, i have no problems with the gdfl or the invariant sections in particular, i just consider them not very useful. if you want to rephrase this as "love to hate" it is your choice, but it would not help you to argue your position

Jun 16 23:49:43 <yrk>	xtifr: lgpl also can be upgraded to gpl, but that isn't because of the licensing exceptions.
Jun 16 23:49:49 <ozzloy>	xtifr, i've wondered about that before.  what's your real world example?
Jun 16 23:49:52 <daniele->	yrk: why are you reiterarting this "being against"?
Jun 16 23:50:19 <daniele->	yrk: isn't there a difference between considering somethign nto very useful and being againts?
Jun 16 23:50:33 <yrk>	daniele-: ok. I'll modify it to: being "somewhat perturbed" by invariant sections, but enough to argue about it on irc...
Jun 16 23:51:12 <daniele->	yrk: somewhat perturbed?
Jun 16 23:51:42 <daniele->	yrk: are you discussing with me only because my opinion makes you feel "somewhat perturbed"?
Jun 16 23:52:23 <xtifr>	ozzloy: wanting to explain in comment why I'm coding something a certain way, easiest is to quote the docs of what I'm calling, but I can't because the license won't allow it
Jun 16 23:52:58 <yrk>	xtifr: the documentation strings of the functions are licensed under gfdl?!

Jun 16 23:53:24 <yrk>	xtifr: that doesn't make any sense at all. if a project is doing that, they should change.
Jun 16 23:53:31 <daniele->	xtifr: unless you are embedding _pages_ of manual material in the source code, copying a few lines is just fine
Jun 16 23:53:41 <yrk>	xtifr: what daniele- said
Jun 16 23:54:16 <xtifr>	maybe, but fair use isn't recognized everywhere
Jun 16 23:54:48 <yrk>	xtifr: so, the problem is that you want to copy bits of the manual into the code?
Jun 16 23:54:55 <xtifr>	and C doesn't have "documentation strings"
Jun 16 23:55:05 <xtifr>	yes
Jun 16 23:55:07 <ozzloy>	ok, i hope no one gets mad but... i just license everything under both the gfdl and the agpl.
Jun 16 23:55:23 <yrk>	ozzloy: that's a common solution

Jun 16 23:56:43 <daniele->	yrk: a while ago there were a thread on emacs-devel about moving example code from the manua to a source file (or viceversa) and the licen was an issue. i don't know how it has been solved tho (being emacs, the solution has probably been to keep the think as it was)

Jun 16 23:58:44 <yrk>	daniele-: but I agree that nobody should be putting large chunks of useful code into manuals. that simply doesn't make sense no matter what documentation license you use. mostly code should live in source files with comments, and mostly text should live in manuals with snippets of code
Jun 16 23:58:49 <daniele->	yrk: i think the issue was having the exampel code being inserted into the manual from an external code file, or something
Jun 16 23:58:59 <bpalmer>	yrk: it is a licensing issue; however, it's one that the FSF can trivially solve
Jun 16 23:59:55 <yrk>	bpalmer: yes. that is a way of looking at it.
Jun 17 00:00:06 <daniele->	or having someone copy code from the manual to a source file and so doing making the source file gfdl derived
Jun 17 00:00:29 <yrk>	similarly, dinner is a issue I can trivially solve. thank you everyone for a interesting conversation, excluding various heresies about garlic bread

Jun 17 08:10:55 <bpalmer>	Not using a theme is literally not specifying a theme.

Jun 17 08:11:20 <eising>	(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
Jun 17 08:11:27 <eising>	for example
Jun 17 08:11:37 <bpalmer>	eising: yes, start emacs with no config; you'll see it is not using a theme.
Jun 17 08:11:38 <techquila>	well i went to gnu emacs site bpalmer and couldn't find anything even remotely like it.  And now that you made your smartass comment I went back to double check. it's not obvious at all.  worded poorly.

Jun 17 08:13:15 <bpalmer>	techquila: *shrug* there's all sorts of ways to figure out if a project is active.
Jun 17 08:13:31 <eising>	well, I like my themes when I use the gui version, but the terminal theme of iterm2 on mac really messes up the colors, making emacs unusable since you can't read anything
Jun 17 08:13:50 <techquila>	i know the project is active.. that was tongue in cheek reference to the fact that it's not apparent from the website
Jun 17 08:13:53 <eising>	anyway, I'll experiment a bit and see what I end up with :)

I'm really surprised and a bit horrified this is how this project is run, but I guess it's working for y'all.

Jun 17 08:51:28 <cjb>	techquila: I don't know how to say this, but here goes: I think if you go into a project wanting to change how things are done, or even just saying its a horrible way to do it, you'll run into a lot of resistance. People may end up despising you without ever hearing you out. Instead learn the ins and outs of how it is done on project xyz, and stick with it for like 6 months.
Jun 17 08:52:04 <techquila>	a proper website, complete with roadmap, integrated wiki, discussion channels etc.

Jun 17 08:56:57 <cjb>	oh, you go to further info, then it has a Savannah link. I was wrong
Jun 17 08:57:14 <john2x>	I tried (erc :server "my_znc_server.com" :port 5000 :nick "john2x" :password "john2x/freenode:hunter2") but I just get 'Connection failed!'
Jun 17 08:57:33 <bpalmer>	john2x: is there something listening on port 5000?
Jun 17 08:58:07 <daniele->	cjb: the bug tracker is not on savannah
Jun 17 08:58:17 <techquila>	daniele-, email has been abused. I'm not saying here, or by GNU, but in general.  There are much better ways to desiminate information on a timely basis, to those who need it, and much more accessible ways for interested public onlookers to search through.
Jun 17 08:58:39 <john2x>	bpalmer: well the web admin interface is accessible at port 5000. Would the irc port be different? 
Jun 17 08:58:48 <daniele->	techquila: for example?

Jun 17 09:00:28 <daniele->	techquila: what bpalmer says
Jun 17 09:00:36 <john2x>	their wiki/docs only mention one port. that seemed strange to me as well
Jun 17 09:01:13 <bpalmer>	john2x: try 6667 for plaintext, 6697 for TLS
Jun 17 09:01:21 <bpalmer>	those are the typical irc ports.
Jun 17 09:01:28 <daniele->	techquila: savannah is just how the emacs git repo is setup, nothing you need to care about to contribute
Jun 17 09:02:34 <techquila>	a well maintained project website, complete with roadmap, integrated wiki, discussion channel.  Option to email notifications if thats what you're into
Jun 17 09:03:23 <daniele->	techquila: what is a "discussion channel"?

Jun 17 09:10:36 <techquila>	nrosvall  i'm not sure what projects you manage but I would expect something that has been in existence as long as emacs, with as many users, and contributors would have a roadmap.
Jun 17 09:10:40 <thebigj>	Hello everyone!
Jun 17 09:10:51 <daniele->	or what's there is exactly to be managed, given that all who hack on emacs are doing so for the glory?
Jun 17 09:10:57 <klostein>	techquila: it's lots of work to actually keep one up to date
Jun 17 09:11:07 <nrosvall>	roadmap might be ok if there's resources (time) to actually keep up with it.
Jun 17 09:11:08 <klostein>	techquila: let alone stick to it and churn out features at the expected rate
Jun 17 09:11:30 <klostein>	techquila: emacs is a volunteer project, it moves along as people donate their time and patience to improve it
Jun 17 09:11:58 <klostein>	techquila: so it moves forward to whatever a contributor considers important and gets accepted
Jun 17 09:12:08 <adamantium>	isn't Emacs don'e already?
Jun 17 09:12:12 <klostein>	far from it
Jun 17 09:12:15 <adamantium>	;)
Jun 17 09:12:17 <klostein>	take a look at the NEWS files
Jun 17 09:12:31 <klostein>	there are many small things in there that improve your editing experience

Jun 17 09:13:59 <klostein>	techquila: the emacs contributor community isn't exactly thriving
Jun 17 09:14:31 <klostein>	there is much red tape involved
Jun 17 09:14:35 <john2x>	bpalmer: I needed to use (erc-tls ...) 
Jun 17 09:14:40 <klostein>	sometimes things are forgotten and rediscovered years later
Jun 17 09:15:02 <klostein>	sometimes contributors walk away because they don't consider it worth their time
Jun 17 09:15:24 <techquila>	perhaps then you all will want to reflect on how you treat people interested in contributing, advising you y'all the issues/barriers that exist that make contributing somehting people want to do then?
Jun 17 09:15:26 <klostein>	and that's perfectly fine
Jun 17 09:15:38 <klostein>	emacs doesn't want to grow beyond what it can handle
Jun 17 09:15:44 <klostein>	it's a super stable project

Jun 17 09:16:04 <klostein>	I've only seen one rushed release, for a security issue
Jun 17 09:16:19 <klostein>	perhaps it's better to compare emacs with other gnu projects, like gcc

Jun 17 09:18:51 <klostein>	the basic problem I see here is that contributions are optimized towards maintainers, not contributors
Jun 17 09:18:52 <daniele->	techquila: you said that. you are saying that someone should "improve" how emcs development is "managed". do you thing that that comes for free?
Jun 17 09:19:06 <klostein>	this is fair because maintainers end up shouldering the burden
Jun 17 09:19:36 <twb>	techquila: is there a specific problem with Emacs project management, that you want fixed?

Jun 17 10:26:38 <twb>	due date: 12 years ago
Jun 17 10:26:41 <twb>	completion: 5%
Jun 17 10:27:54 <lampilelo>	RMS would come there, write "word processor" and it would be SO USEFULL because noone wants to work on that and people just tell him "so go and implement it"

Jun 17 10:30:31 <lg188>	and communication gets fuzzy because it's retold by so many people in the chain
Jun 17 10:30:48 <klostein>	there are smaller projects pulling it off if there's paid contributors
Jun 17 10:31:24 <klostein>	others sacrifice something else, like stability/quality of the project
Jun 17 10:31:26 <lg188>	that's because the company wants to know what they're investing in, I guess

Jun 17 10:36:13 <carmack>	Hi guys what do you think about emacs Doom?
Jun 17 10:36:22 <bpalmer>	it's inevitable.
Jun 17 10:36:47 <twb>	is it like rldoom?

Jun 17 10:37:05 <twb>	Frankly I think doom is pretty boring.
Jun 17 10:37:07 <bpalmer>	nothing may escape its wyrd.
Jun 17 10:37:30 <twb>	Really to modernize it, you need to have a ten-second sex scene at the end that's only accessible after 50 hours of crappy dialogue
Jun 17 10:37:55 <twb>	bpalmer: now I am thinking about a t-shirt that says "BUT DOES IT DREE?"
Jun 17 10:39:07 <lg188>	so doom emacs is just a different spacemacs ?
Jun 17 10:39:29 <klostein>	looks like yet another emacs config to me
Jun 17 10:39:57 <twb>	the one that really impressed me was the one that makes the whole emacs shake and stars appear around the cursor if you code fast enough
Jun 17 10:40:13 <twb>	sort of a "combo damage" vibe

Cheap because it doesn't generate any trench-digging work for labourers who live inside the country.

Since the 1980s they both represent the rich dickheads, because they own the TV, and the TV tells voters that what dickheads want is what they want.
Jun 22 16:25:18 *	caoliver points lamely at Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent.
Jun 22 16:25:54 <twb>	parsnip: and Dickhead Lite had an "invest in infrastructure" plan, like FDR or your interstate network, except it was to fix up our shit internet
Jun 22 16:25:55 <parsnip>	I'm pretty close to having my app initialize to RUB if your locale is russia, even if I havent translated the UI to russia
Jun 22 16:26:58 <caoliver>	The rise of an FDR-like politician requires a better educated public though.  (grumble grumble)
Jun 22 16:27:04 <twb>	parsnip: but Dickhead Party was like "building things?  That's so 18th century.  We only do financial instruments now."
Jun 22 16:27:14 <parsnip>	franklin d Roosevelt?
Jun 22 16:27:15 <twb>	caoliver: well, or a GIANT DEPRESSION
Jun 22 16:27:19 <twb>	parsnip: yeah
Jun 22 16:27:40 <twb>	parsnip: as USian leaders go he was relatively socialist (AFAICT)

Jun 22 20:36:53 <bexx>	you're right
Jun 22 20:37:19 <bexx>	parsnip: also in tryRFC3339: 'Probar RFC 3339' is more like try
Jun 22 20:37:25 <bexx>	parsnip: try is a verb
Jun 22 20:37:34 <parsnip>	ah nice, thank you

Jun 22 20:41:38 <parsnip>	apple uses title case more. but the framework is google, so fuck it.

Jun 22 20:42:12 <Illya>	what do you guys do about all the buffers which look like *this*? is there a way I can hide them except say, org-related buffers in the C-x b menu?
Jun 22 20:43:31 <dale>	Illya: If you're using Ivy then you could hide them with ivy-ignore-buffers, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

Jun 22 21:14:30 <parsnip>	interesting question
Jun 22 21:14:57 <johnjay>	idk, i just think there should be
Jun 22 21:15:15 <parsnip>	n and p are easy, it's the next or previous sibling i think
Jun 22 21:15:24 <parsnip>	[ and ] i'm not sure what to call that
Jun 22 21:15:34 <johnjay>	like you could call same level jumps 'hops' and ones that ascend or descend 'climbs'
Jun 22 21:15:59 <parsnip>	parent for u is fine for me, and child for <integer>

Jun 22 21:16:01 <johnjay>	i know there's prefix, infix, and postfix that get used for binary trees
Jun 22 21:16:08 <johnjay>	i guess
Jun 22 21:16:11 <johnjay>	so sibling?
Jun 22 21:16:24 <parsnip>	sibling for n,p, is what comes to mind to me, yes
Jun 22 21:16:28 <johnjay>	forward-sibling, back-sibling
Jun 22 21:16:34 <parsnip>	_i'm_ satisfied 😉
Jun 22 21:16:43 <johnjay>	up-parent, down-parent
Jun 22 21:17:14 <parsnip>	next and prev would be better, since you're already using the letters n, p
Jun 22 21:17:19 <johnjay>	you still need to differentiate between [ and n which was my main point
Jun 22 21:17:19 *	neosloth has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jun 22 21:17:36 <parsnip>	yes, [, ] is the interesting bit. they're not simply next sibling
Jun 22 21:17:59 <johnjay>	[ and ] are more like postfix and infix traversal
Jun 22 21:18:00 <parsnip>	i'm _sure_ there's a word for it. my instinct is to go ask on ##algorithms, but i should search the web
Jun 22 21:18:06 <johnjay>	maybe forward-traverse and backward-traverse?
Jun 22 21:18:34 <johnjay>	or maybe just forward backward
Jun 22 21:18:40 <johnjay>	since you're traversing the tree in a linear fashion
Jun 22 21:19:29 *	neosloth (~neosloth@192.157.106.221) has joined
Jun 22 21:19:37 <johnjay>	actually infix would be interesting to define for non-binary trees

Jun 23 22:16:55 <dale>	jmarciano: I think C-h m will list all active modes at the top.  Most often you can also C-h v name-of-the-mode RET to see if the variable is non-nil.

Jun 23 22:18:00 <dale>	jmarciano: If you need to do it programmatically, just looking at the mode's variable is what I typically use.  If you're talking about a major-mode, probably use derived-mode-p.

Jun 23 22:21:18 <jmarciano>	that works

Jun 23 22:21:32 <wasamasa>	depending on what it is, the procedure is different
Jun 23 22:22:23 <jmarciano>	I see, this is good enough for purpose to set the key upon message mode to message-kill-to-signature

I typically get the string to put inside the (kbd) call from doing C-h c, hitting the key(s) I want to bind, and then seeing how they're printed in the minibuffer.

Jun 24 10:27:04 <kqr>	to avoid the risk of running down an XY rabbit hole: I really dislike having the point butt up against the edges of the window. the only solution I have at the moment that will let me avoid that situation when point is at the beginning of a buffer, is to automatically insert a bunch of whitespace lines at the beginning of buffers. this is not a very nice solution when coopering with others.

Jun 24 10:27:57 <kqr>	sort of before-save-hook that cleans this up, but before I dig too deeply into that: does anyone know of any other solution to this? e.g. having an empty region that is displayed at the top of the buffer, but not actually part of the contents that will be saved, or somesuch?

Jun 24 10:31:49 <kqr>	are both of those not active all the time, even when point is not at bob?
Jun 24 10:32:06 <bpalmer>	yes, that's true.
Jun 24 10:32:17 <bpalmer>	but presumably you don't need to be looking where point isn't.
Jun 24 10:33:01 <kqr>	but if I want point centered at all times, I'd need a header line that occupies 50% of the frame, which is not ideal.
Jun 24 10:33:28 <kqr>	(I get that it's an unreasonable/unusual request, and I'm not going to pursue it very far, but it would be nice if there was a simple way to get it done anyway.)
Jun 24 10:36:37 <bpalmer>	I don't know of any. I suppose you could insert an overlay that has a :display property of, e.g., 500 space characters
Jun 24 10:37:09 <bpalmer>	since overlays aren't written out when saved (barring special work), it'll just disappear; and they're inherently bound to location in a way that text properties aren't.
Jun 24 10:38:43 <kqr>	that's what I'm currently looking into. will try a few things out and if I don't get it to work I'll drop it. :) thanks for indicating I might be on the right track
Jun 24 10:39:01 <bpalmer>	oh, display supports indication of height and width
Jun 24 10:39:10 <kqr>	yes
Jun 24 10:40:28 <bpalmer>	What I was starting to mess with was (defvar top-of-text-overlay (let ((o (make-overlay (point-min) (point-min)))) (overlay-put o 'display (make-string 100 ?\ )) o))
Jun 24 10:40:50 <bpalmer>	but clearly directly specifying width and height would be better. Or insert a friendly smiling clown image, or whatever.

Jun 24 12:27:03 <roelj>	blandest: Well, how do I do M-x? It seems to get ignored.
Jun 24 12:27:03 <blandest>	It looks like it's only a prefix but maybe you have it bound to something

Jun 24 12:27:27 <blandest>	roelj: switch to line-mode first
Jun 24 12:27:50 <blandest>	in the mode line you should have something like: Term: char run
Jun 24 12:28:01 <roelj>	C-c C-j and C-c C-k are both undefined
Jun 24 12:28:26 <blandest>	then that's pretty strange
Jun 24 12:28:27 <roelj>	In the modeline it says (Term: char run)
Jun 24 12:28:38 <blandest>	click on "char" to switch to line mode
Jun 24 12:28:48 <blandest>	mouse click that is
Jun 24 12:28:49 <roelj>	That worked
Jun 24 12:29:02 <blandest>	so now you should be able to type M-x
Jun 24 12:29:18 <blandest>	M-x works in line mode only

Jun 24 12:29:25 <roelj>	Thanks :)
Jun 24 12:30:02 <roelj>	Unfortunately, when I do: "M-x describe-key [RET] C-c", it waits for another key input
Jun 24 12:30:15 *	dancn has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Jun 24 12:30:16 <roelj>	meaning.. nothing binds to "C-c" only? 
Jun 24 12:32:00 <roelj>	It seems that when I enter "char" mode, my keybindings stop working.  When I enter "line" mode, C-c C-k changes to "char" mode.  But once in "char" mode, I can't do C-c C-j to get into "line" mode.

Jun 24 12:34:12 <blandest>	if it waits for input it means that C-c is not bound to anything, rather it's a prefix for a longer key sequence

Jun 27 12:46:17 <jmarciano>	is there any way to find which function is currently running from inside of the function? So that I can log some actions.
Jun 27 12:47:41 <enikar>	in which language ?
Jun 27 12:47:47 <jmarciano>	emacs lisp
Jun 27 12:49:09 <enikar>	you can always see the source of a function : type C-h f RET function-name RET
Jun 27 12:49:55 <npostavs>	jmarciano: you mean while running?  backtrace-frame might help
Jun 27 12:49:58 <jmarciano>	This yes. But within function like (defun example () (current-function)) something like this is impossible?
Jun 27 12:50:12 <enikar>	the source is easily open from the help buffer.
Jun 27 12:51:12 <jmarciano>	I see that can work backtrace-frame
Jun 27 12:51:17 <jmarciano>	excellent, thanks
Jun 27 12:52:07 <jmarciano>	it just requires to know the frame number...
Jun 27 12:53:29 <npostavs>	jmarciano: I think in your case the number should always be 1 (it counts up the call stack)

Jun 27 13:04:25 <npostavs>	jmarciano: the calling function would be 2, no?
Jun 27 13:06:55 <jmarciano>	now it just looks within the function itself. Not within the upper function
Jun 27 13:07:12 <jmarciano>	OK I will just send function symbol as argument to logging function. Solved.

Jun 27 15:00:03 <TDT>	So....kinda random question.  For using emacs on a remote machine, is there a good way to use something like emacsclient to connect to a remote instance of emacs but have the GUI more local?
Jun 27 15:00:27 <TDT>	I'm thinking of that instead of doing passing SSH with X and running emacs or emacsclient that way

Jun 27 15:02:25 <TDT>	I was thinking that, but can that work with straight up connections and accessing all the buffers already loaded?
Jun 27 15:02:53 <TDT>	Reason I worry about TRAMP is that I've only used it for editing files remotely.  But if I have file A open on my workstation, then try to edit the same file, then something can be overwritten
Jun 27 15:03:01 <TDT>	I'm thinking primarily for org mode that I want to do this for.

Jun 27 15:04:43 <offby1>	if you're using ssh (as opposed to mosh) to connect to the remote emacs, I have a hair-raisingly ugly kludge that will more or less let the remote emacs put stuff onto the local clipboard.
Jun 27 15:04:56 <offby1>	You will need industrial eye protection to look at the code though
Jun 27 15:05:04 <loskutak>	lol
Jun 27 15:05:51 <offby1>	in theory you can run your remote Emacs in gui mode, and have it display on a local X server.  That's a) a pain in the ass to set up if your local box is a Mac (as mine is), and b) dog-slow
Jun 27 15:06:28 <offby1>	man, I remember when the whole idea of X was exciting.  Display stuff remotely!
Jun 27 15:06:32 <offby1>	we were dumb then
Jun 27 15:07:07 <z0d>	no, technology was different back then
Jun 27 15:07:36 <z0d>	I really hope that we'll ditch X at some point for some modern stuff

Jun 28 13:43:27 <raph_ael>	is there any way to have eshell standalone ? ie outside emacs (just for fun)
Jun 28 13:56:16 <hodapp>	hmmm, I don't think so, as it's pretty tied in with Emacs
Jun 28 14:15:27 <raph_ael>	hodapp: thanks I was thinking it might be like that too, but who knows
Jun 28 14:20:11 <hodapp>	you could probably starts emacs in such a manner to drop you right into eshell
Jun 28 14:21:18 <enikar>	it'll be an heavy shell start :D
Jun 28 14:21:50 <parsnip>	emacs -Q -f eshell

Jun 28 14:31:20 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some days, the sun rises, and you look upon your works and despair
Jun 28 14:31:36 <rudybot>	bpalmer: "In Portuguese, norte-americano is the most commonly used term. Estadunidense is gaining some popularity, specifically in Brazil, where its usage traditionally rises during times of tension with the USA."
Jun 28 15:14:33 <Illya>	those of you who use projectile, how can I bury all old project buffers on switching project? I essentially just want my buffer states to be saved when I switch around projects
Jun 28 15:15:09 <Illya>	maybe I'm thinking of it as a full context switch when it shouldn't really be used like that
Jun 28 15:15:38 <pointsman>	Building master the build is somewhat clittered with warnings:
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	lisp.h:413:38: warning: potential null pointer dereference [-Wnull-dereference]
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	 #define lisp_h_XCAR(c) XCONS (c)->u.s.car
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	lisp.h:1406:10: note: in expansion of macro ‘lisp_h_XCAR’
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	   return lisp_h_XCAR (c);
Jun 28 15:16:22 <pointsman>	Too sad, after Lars cleaned up so nicely all that noisy build warnings.
Jun 28 15:16:47 <pointsman>	This is with gcc 6.3.0.
Jun 28 15:17:26 <pointsman>	Is that known?
Jun 28 15:17:53 <klostein>	lars worked on the elisp bits
Jun 28 15:18:59 <dada_cetacean>	hey folks, i'd like to define a custom user command for switching to a particular theme. how do i find the elisp i need to execute for this? (i only know how to use `customize-theme`)
Jun 28 15:24:30 <Illya>	(load-theme "name" t nil) ?
Jun 28 15:28:21 <dada_cetacean>	Illya: oh that even has an interactive mode which does exactly wha ti want
Jun 28 15:28:23 <dada_cetacean>	thanks!
Jun 28 15:29:23 <dada_cetacean>	second question: how do i ensure that an org-mode code block does not insert the output beneath the code block after execution?
Jun 28 15:35:00 <dada_cetacean>	also, how do i ensure that when using `load-theme`, all over active themes are disabled?
Jun 28 15:38:54 <npostavs>	pointsman: I think that's a known bug, it sounds familiar
Jun 28 15:39:48 <npostavs>	pointsman: ,,bug 32444,, Lars says "it's not present with a newer gcc"
Jun 28 15:39:49 <fsbot>	https://debbugs.gnu.org/32444
Jun 28 15:41:12 <tromey>	for older gcc you probably want to just disable warnings
Jun 28 15:49:45 <pointsman>	OK; thanks.
Jun 28 15:57:04 <raph_ael>	parsnip: fun thanks
Jun 28 16:11:42 <mns>	I have a ~/.emacs.d/elisp directory, which has sub-directories, one for each package I want to use.  I can not use use-package (build machines behind firewalls with no access to outside world).  What I want to do is process the ~/.emacs.d/elisp/*/*-autloads.el files.  How would I do that without explicitly stating each package ? 
Jun 28 16:38:07 <JordiGH>	So, how easy are memory leaks in Rust?
Jun 28 16:38:21 <JordiGH>	Not necessarily literal memory leaks that valgrind would find.
Jun 28 16:39:25 <bpalmer>	pretty easy. Make something that doesn't autodispose of itself.
Jun 28 16:40:07 <tromey>	I think in the Rust model a leak is not considered a memory safety violation
Jun 28 16:40:19 <tromey>	however in normal code it's difficult to leak
Jun 28 16:40:23 <bpalmer>	https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/leaking.html
Jun 28 16:40:38 <bpalmer>	I forgot about mem::forget
Jun 28 16:41:03 <tromey>	Java had some terminology for the ways to leak that don't look like leaking
Jun 28 16:41:12 <tromey>	like if you have data that is unused but can't be collected
Jun 28 16:41:21 <tromey>	loiterers and lingerers, something like that
Jun 28 16:41:35 <tromey>	Rust, and really no language afaik, prevents that kind of thing
Jun 28 16:42:03 <JordiGH>	I bet we could rephrase leaks as a stopping problem.
Jun 28 16:42:11 <bpalmer>	sure.
Jun 28 16:42:27 <bpalmer>	a = new int(); f(); delete a;   <-- a is only deleted if f terminates
Jun 28 16:44:32 <bpalmer>	At any rate.
Jun 28 16:46:30 <edgar-rft>	All sorts of infinite loops cause memory leaks because the memory won't get freed until the end of the univese.
Jun 28 16:46:59 <bpalmer>	we'd better end the universe soon so we can reclaim our resources.
Jun 28 16:48:20 <edgar-rft>	the more difficult question is if it's a *real* memory leak when the memory *gets* freed at the end of the universe
Jun 28 16:50:36 <edgar-rft>	(when (end-of-universe-p) (garbage-collect))
Jun 28 16:50:43 <bpalmer>	you know what they say about equivalence of energy and memory.
Jun 28 16:51:22 <bpalmer>	I'm too tired to remember all the details, though.
Jun 28 16:52:35 <edgar-rft>	yes, you already forgot about mem::forget, that's enough for today
Jun 28 16:52:46 <fledermaus>	Just scribble a note in the margin.
Jun 28 16:52:50 <fledermaus>	it'll be fine.
Jun 28 16:53:33 <edgar-rft>	energy drinks can help to increase your memory
Jun 28 16:54:08 <tromey>	that's why I drink battery juice
Jun 28 16:54:34 <gnomon>	I always look into this channel at the weirdest times
Jun 28 16:54:45 <JordiGH>	It's edgar-rft's fault it got weird.
Jun 28 16:54:48 <JordiGH>	I keep it normal.
Jun 28 16:55:01 <JordiGH>	So, about that git program that's gotten popular these days...
Jun 28 16:55:11 <JordiGH>	Do you think it will really catch on?
Jun 28 16:55:16 <JordiGH>	Seems like a fad to me.
Jun 28 16:55:18 <tromey>	too soon to tell
Jun 28 16:55:34 <bpalmer>	by the end of the universe we might know.
Jun 28 16:55:35 <tromey>	I was assigned to work on gcj in the cygnus days and I was unhappy because java was a fad
Jun 28 16:55:57 <bpalmer>	java's success was a black swan event, to be sure.
Jun 28 16:56:05 <JordiGH>	tromey: I saw your name on some autotools-generated Makefile the other day and was like, huh, dude sure got around.
Jun 28 16:56:23 <edgar-rft>	The next question is, if energy and memory are equivalent, than how much memory is in a bottle of energy?
Jun 28 16:56:24 <tromey>	yes, I mainly wrote automake
Jun 28 16:56:38 <tromey>	well back in the day, it's been rewritten a lot I think
Jun 28 16:56:42 <JordiGH>	edgar-rft: Been playing cuphead?
Jun 28 16:58:31 <JordiGH>	tromey: gcj was a fad, though.
Jun 28 16:58:37 <JordiGH>	,libation
Jun 28 16:58:37 *	fsbot pours one out for those we have lost.
Jun 28 16:58:39 <tromey>	sadly
Jun 28 16:58:45 <edgar-rft>	Wikipedia says: First announced in 2014, the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in September 2017, for macOS in October 2018, and for Nintendo Switch in April 2019. Hmm, I own none of them, that's why I never played cuphead.
Jun 28 16:58:45 <tromey>	ah well
Jun 28 16:58:58 <JordiGH>	edgar-rft: Well, they have cups for heads.
Jun 28 16:59:07 <JordiGH>	So, I guess you could drink their memories.
Jun 28 16:59:38 <edgar-rft>	Aah, nice idea :-)
Jun 28 17:33:54 <johnjay>	indeed
Jun 28 17:34:53 <kenrestivo>	or you could drink the blood of children, like peter thiel
Jun 28 17:34:54 <johnjay>	melpa has 0 packages?
Jun 28 17:34:55 <johnjay>	eh
Jun 28 17:35:16 <johnjay>	oh there we go
Jun 28 17:35:20 <JordiGH>	kenrestivo: Don't be silly, he doesn't drink it. He takes it intravenously.
Jun 28 17:35:32 <kenrestivo>	ah, thanks for the clarification
Jun 28 17:37:10 <johnjay>	argh shoot i can't remember that emacs mode someone showed me
Jun 28 17:37:18 <johnjay>	the one where it colors the columns different colors
Jun 28 17:37:51 <kenrestivo>	columns? like csv-mode?
Jun 28 17:38:12 <twrk>	I guess like lolcat, but more vertical
Jun 28 17:38:13 <johnjay>	idk it's in source code and it will paint different grey colors on the columns for indentation
Jun 28 17:38:22 <johnjay>	it was highlight color something
Jun 28 17:38:27 <kenrestivo>	oh, yeah, i use that for idiotic languages like python and yaml
Jun 28 17:38:35 <kenrestivo>	h-i-g mode?
Jun 28 17:38:45 <twrk>	just tried highlight-indentation-(tab)
Jun 28 17:38:59 <twrk>	highlight-indentation-current-column-mode ?
Jun 28 17:39:08 <kenrestivo>	Highlight-Indent-Guides minor mode (indicator h-i-g):
Jun 28 17:39:27 <kenrestivo>	has saved my ass multiple times
Jun 28 17:39:43 <johnjay>	that's close to what i want
Jun 28 17:39:49 <johnjay>	but it's not using a different sh ade for each column
Jun 28 17:40:00 <johnjay>	i think maybe it's alternating?
Jun 28 17:40:08 <kenrestivo>	it's a very slightly alternating shade on mine
Jun 28 17:40:16 <kenrestivo>	gray and light gray?
Jun 28 17:40:25 <johnjay>	yes
Jun 28 17:40:31 <johnjay>	i wanted something like dark grey light grey grey lighter grey
Jun 28 17:40:40 <kenrestivo>	customize?
Jun 28 17:40:40 <fsbot>	From memory, Customize is [0] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Customize
Jun 28 17:40:40 <fsbot>	[1] a built in command to setup emacs to your liking in an easy way available through M-x customize RET
Jun 28 17:41:01 <twrk>	anyway, TAGS are great, but they cover a lot of ground and you have to append from several different places... is there a simpler way to get automatic code navigation like in visual studio? basically some tool to see a source file in a "project" directory, and then create all the references for jumping to definitions
Jun 28 17:41:30 <twrk>	...company-mode? :/ idk
Jun 28 17:42:00 *	kenrestivo smacks the bad gateway over the nose with a rolled-up newspaper
Jun 28 17:42:18 <kenrestivo>	god that analogy is old. who even has newspapers anymore
Jun 28 17:42:47 <twrk>	smack noses with e-readers
Jun 28 17:43:21 <johnjay>	hmm well it's built in to alternate odd and even columns
Jun 28 17:43:30 <johnjay>	i'd have to tweak the code a bit, not sure it's worth it
Jun 28 17:43:33 <johnjay>	this might be the 80% solution
Jun 28 17:46:40 <johnjay>	what's the best emacsy way to temporarily format some text in the region?
Jun 28 17:46:52 <johnjay>	narrow the buffer or create a new temp buffer and pop to that and then do stuff?
Jun 28 17:47:48 <JordiGH>	I usually narrow.
Jun 28 17:48:20 <johnjay>	ah with-help-window looks good
Jun 28 17:48:23 <sg2002>	twrk: Well creating projects is not simpler by any means. Anyway, ggtags mode is pretty good. For simple usecases you just run gtags in your root directory and here's your "project"
Jun 28 17:48:41 <twrk>	ok, I try
Jun 28 17:48:58 <sg2002>	twrk: There's also projectile and that has some kind of tags intergration, if you really want project-based workflow.
Jun 28 17:49:07 <johnjay>	with-temp-buffer looks pretty hairy
Jun 28 17:49:13 <johnjay>	how does it enable hitting 'q' to quit the window?
Jun 28 17:54:01 <twrk>	defining the key in the mode map
Jun 28 17:54:10 <johnjay>	oh
Jun 28 17:54:45 <twrk>	(looking at buff-menu as an example, buff-menu.el, from doing C-x C-b)
Jun 28 17:59:15 <noonker>	Is anyone here using emacs-slack? I'm having an issue where if I'm visiting a remote file with tramp the slack websocket tries to use my tramp connection. Curious if anyone's seen that before and had a solution. 
Jun 28 18:00:19 <technomancy>	noonker: I didn't run into that particular problem but I did find just a lot of instability overall
Jun 28 18:00:51 <noonker>	I've honestly been having pretty good luck with it- hell even this works it just slows things WAY down.

Jul 11 01:08:23 <hodapp>	Now let's get a volunteer from the audience to come up here.
Jul 11 01:08:35 *	hodapp very obviously picks fjmng "at random" intentionally
Jul 11 01:08:40 <hodapp>	You, sir! Come up here!

Jul 11 01:08:56 *	rwp remembers "vigor".  It was a clippy mode satirically written for vi back in the day...
Jul 11 01:08:57 <fjmng>	o-ok sir
Jul 11 01:09:02 <hodapp>	Don't be shy, now! I won't tell your wife about all the attention I see the ladies giving you.
Jul 11 01:09:13 <fjmng>	h-ha ha
Jul 11 01:09:30 <hodapp>	Alright, now let's do a little experiment. Give me your wallet for a moment.
Jul 11 01:09:31 <iqubic>	Is there a way to compare two branches in the same git repo?
Jul 11 01:09:42 <fjmng>	Ok
Jul 11 01:10:16 <hodapp>	Okay, thank you sir! Now, I have to go get something, but I'll be right back.
Jul 11 01:10:18 *	hodapp doesn't return
Jul 11 01:10:52 <npostavs>	iqubic: you're saying that as if there is a way to compare two branches in different git repos.
Jul 11 01:11:34 <fjmng>	Um
Jul 11 01:11:36 <fjmng>	Hello?
Jul 11 01:11:37 <fsbot>	Здравствуйте fjmng!
Jul 11 01:11:51 <fjmng>	Its getting kind of late...
Jul 11 01:11:54 <parsnip>	rudybot: where are my parents!
Jul 11 01:11:56 <rudybot>	parsnip: Even wikipedia's article about the serial comma is stupid. They use the example of "To my parents, Ayn Rand, and God." as being ambiguous because it's unclear where it's three chunks, or if Ayn Rand and God are parents. It's unambiguoulsy three separate items because a colon should be used if Ayn Rand and God were parents, i.e. "To my parents: ..."
Jul 11 01:11:57 <fjmng>	all the people are gone...

Jul 11 01:15:25 <fjmng>	hmmmm
Jul 11 01:15:31 <fjmng>	maybe kenzo is a scammer...
Jul 11 01:25:11 <michaelrose>	so what is the optimal way to run a shell command from inside emacs that expects interactive input?
Jul 11 01:27:33 <butterthebuddha>	michaelrose: eshell is an option, though idk about optimal
Jul 11 01:27:56 <michaelrose>	specifically I was trying to use cargo run or the function from rustic that wraps cargo run to run a function that prompts for input while going through a tutorial book "the rust programming language" simply running the shell command or the function ends up outputting some text to a buffer but isn't designed to actually take input
Jul 11 01:28:16 <butterthebuddha>	michaelrose: there is a cargo package for emcs
Jul 11 01:28:24 <butterthebuddha>	Nvm
Jul 11 01:28:33 <butterthebuddha>	I'd use ehsell or ansi-term for that
Jul 11 01:28:54 <fjmng>	Just use C, the master language
Jul 11 01:29:05 <michaelrose>	fjmng, that really isn't a useful answer
Jul 11 01:29:12 <fjmng>	Yes it is
Jul 11 01:29:27 <technomancy>	it's useful if you need to update your /ignore list
Jul 11 01:29:45 <fjmng>	heh
Jul 11 01:38:26 <parsnip>	wow, china, cuba, and iran cannot download paid apps from android play store
Jul 11 01:38:27 <michaelrose>	well running async-shell-command actually allows input so that is interesting

Jul 11 09:03:32 <dminuoso>	Hi. Ive been using emacs (using spacemacs) for a while now, and I've not exactly grown comfortable with it, mostly because frequently "things dont work" and I dont understand why enough. Sometimes I press some keys and emacs hangs for a second or two for no reason that is obvious to me.
Jul 11 09:03:49 <loke>	dmiFirst step: Don't use spacemacs
Jul 11 09:03:53 <parsnip>	❝Allowing different localized number formats in the same file is one of the major reasons I chose hledger over ledger. Allowing them to be different across the same commodity is madness, but having different commodities each with their own respective proper formats is perfectly normal.❞
Jul 11 09:04:20 <dminuoso>	loke: That seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?
Jul 11 09:04:53 <dminuoso>	Im mostly wondering how one could approach emacs in a fashion to allow discoverability of "how do I XYZ"
Jul 11 09:04:55 <parsnip>	❝Interesting. Why wouldn't you just use the standard followed in your locale?  For instance, even when I enter a foreign currency transaction (in say, EUR), I still write € 10,000.00 instead of 10.000,00 €.❞
Jul 11 09:05:09 <parsnip>	"What is 'my locale'?"
Jul 11 09:05:12 <parsnip>	i love this stuff
Jul 11 09:05:43 <parsnip>	dminuoso: we really can't help much with troubleshooting spacemacs
Jul 11 09:05:55 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Oh I think my problems are more emacs related than spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:06:41 <parsnip>	dminuoso: there's very straightforward ways to troubleshoot things in emacs, and you are missing out on those in spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:07:17 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Oh? Mind my asking what those are? If there's arguments in favor for using emacs over spacemacs I'm game.
Jul 11 09:07:58 <parsnip>	i just made an argument
Jul 11 09:08:30 <dminuoso>	Am I not allowed to ask what those "straightforward ways" even are? :p
Jul 11 09:09:01 <parsnip>	so you want me to philosophize about a potential debugging problem in a way that _won't_ work for you?
Jul 11 09:09:19 <parsnip>	please see ,,spacemacs 2 2,,
Jul 11 09:09:19 <fsbot>	I think spacemacs is support is available at https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs .. + other notes
Jul 11 09:09:48 <michaelrose>	With standard emacs you start out with a stable base that is extremely likely to not be busted. You can then add functions as you need them and observe the result. If the result is obvious brokeness you can disable what you just added and be back to a stable base
Jul 11 09:09:55 <parsnip>	it's late here, i'm not in the mood to philoshiphize
Jul 11 09:09:59 <twb>	Wow cool what was tar doing when seccomp stopped it
Jul 11 09:10:02 <dminuoso>	parsnip: I think you misunderstand. My question is "What does emacs have in that regard that spacemacs doesnt?"
Jul 11 09:10:20 <twb>	"tar xf -" doesn't tell me much.  I suspect it's building the postfix chroot
Jul 11 09:10:30 <twb>	dminuoso: honor
Jul 11 09:10:44 <parsnip>	dminuoso: emacs does not have a huge gap between "does it occur in emacs -Q", and, "try bisecting your config".
Jul 11 09:10:57 <parsnip>	that's it
Jul 11 09:11:01 <michaelrose>	dminuoso, spacemacs is a massive pile of packages with a lower standard of care than base emacs
Jul 11 09:11:27 <parsnip>	michaelrose: colon is the convention on irc
Jul 11 09:11:28 <twb>	More seriously, what GNU Emacs has that spacemacs lacks is... support.
Jul 11 09:12:40 <parsnip>	twb: but someone made emacs shiny for me
Jul 11 09:13:04 <parsnip>	by slapping together, _already existing packages_
Jul 11 09:13:25 <parsnip>	it still kills me that they associate themselves with vim and "a distro"
Jul 11 09:13:39 <twb>	parsnip: spacevm?
Jul 11 09:14:02 <parsnip>	twb: no, spacemacs represent themselves as if they wrote evil-mode.el
Jul 11 09:14:46 <dminuoso>	parsnip: For what its worth, it was the seemingly easy way to "get something pretty while maintaining vi layout" that attracted me to spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:14:58 <dminuoso>	It took me a while too to realize that evil is not a spacemacs thing..
Jul 11 09:15:05 <michaelrose>	dminuoso: it appears that you yourself have made the argument against spacemacs for everyone already. You say your experience with it is buggy and troublesome
Jul 11 09:15:13 <dminuoso>	michaelrose: Heh.
Jul 11 09:15:21 <dminuoso>	I take your point.
Jul 11 09:21:11 <knobo1>	Can I use different type of indexing for different type of projectile projects?
Jul 11 09:22:02 <knobo1>	I want to register my own type of project that uses native indexing method.
Jul 11 09:22:19 <knobo1>	And use alien on all other projects.
Jul 11 09:45:50 <krux02>	knobo1, i have no idea what you want
Jul 11 10:13:38 <parsnip>	what is this?
Jul 11 10:13:40 <parsnip>	(y) (y)
Jul 11 10:15:35 <twb>	parsnip: are those nipple rings?
Jul 11 10:18:06 <parsnip>	idk, can't find it here: http://kaomoji.ru/en/
Jul 11 10:19:37 <z0d>	parsnip: looks like a malformed lambda expression :-> 
Jul 11 10:22:13 <parsnip>	this is the same guy as when i didn't understand their github emoji
Jul 11 10:23:12 <ski>	rudybot: Is this some new form of inscrutable emojibake?
Jul 11 10:23:22 <rudybot>	ski: i actually get annoyed with emacs lisp's weird inscrutable things. for me they include that, apply-partially, the new advice system for no real reason, and the elimination of a form dedicated to dynamic let.
Jul 11 10:26:56 <parsnip>	emoji seem to be the solution to the problem that Kaomoji created
Jul 11 10:28:45 <twb>	parsnip: you know emoji first started on docomo / ntt phone network, right
Jul 11 10:29:05 <parsnip>	sort of yes
Jul 11 10:29:13 <parsnip>	vaguely recall
Jul 11 10:34:38 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Okay so an hour of emacs makes me a bit angry. Things just work. :<
Jul 11 10:34:51 <dminuoso>	spacemacs should come with a big sign that says "Here be dragons and bugs"
Jul 11 10:35:05 <parsnip>	dminuoso: were you on master or develop?
Jul 11 10:35:16 <dminuoso>	master
Jul 11 10:35:24 <twb>	dminuoso: doesn't spacemacs have nyancat on by default
Jul 11 10:35:38 <parsnip>	dminuoso: i think master is deprecated
Jul 11 10:35:39 <twb>	That would be a bit of a giveaway
Jul 11 10:35:58 <parsnip>	dminuoso: but anyways, easier for people here if you use emacs.
Jul 11 10:36:13 <twb>	parsnip: wait... people check out un-tagged git commit and expect it to wok?
Jul 11 10:37:17 <dminuoso>	Im slowly realizing that spacemacs is really overkill. Any package you want, you can still load from melpa..
Jul 11 10:37:46 <dminuoso>	And perhaps it forces me to understand what Im doing more, rather than emacs automatically fetching things and configuring things when I open a file.
Jul 11 10:43:03 <parsnip>	lol, the matrix users are using @ now
Jul 11 10:43:54 <parsnip>	"i remember when this was an irc channel"
Jul 11 10:44:40 <twb>	dminuoso: truly, there are many lawns for those damn kids to get off of.
Jul 11 10:45:31 <twb>	When is pNFS useful?
Jul 11 10:53:56 <hortiel>	hi
Jul 11 10:54:11 <hortiel>	how do i repeatedly paste a sentence 7 times in emacs , using repeating cmd
Jul 11 10:54:21 <hortiel>	I tried but for some reason it works only for one letter
Jul 11 10:56:17 <parsnip>	i just press paste 7 times
Jul 11 10:56:23 <parsnip>	or record a keyboard macro
Jul 11 10:56:55 <parsnip>	why one letter? what method are you using to copy?
Jul 11 10:57:56 <hortiel>	i don't know macro at this stage. I use C-u
Jul 11 10:58:51 <hortiel>	C-y I need to press it 7 times. but i don't want to
Jul 11 10:59:16 <hortiel>	let's say it 70 times, can't be don't I used C-u 70 C-y ; didn't work??
Jul 11 10:59:16 <fsbot>	Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
Jul 11 10:59:35 <hortiel>	C-u repeats it, but in this case it's not repeating ... annoying.
Jul 11 10:59:52 <hortiel>	parsnip: what do you mean you just press paste 70 times.
Jul 11 11:00:08 <parsnip>	oh, i missed the line with 70
Jul 11 11:00:16 <parsnip>	oh, reading
Jul 11 11:00:52 <hortiel>	...
Jul 11 11:01:50 <parsnip>	maybe C-u 70 C-y
Jul 11 11:04:09 <parsnip>	you can also use C-u 70 with keyboard macros
Jul 11 11:04:41 <parsnip>	so like <f3> C-y <f4> C-u 70 <f4>
Jul 11 11:06:00 <parsnip>	and maybe C-y C-u 70 C-x z works. but <f3/4> seem more robust
Jul 11 11:06:40 <parsnip>	becasue what if C-y ate C-u 70 as some argument?
Jul 11 11:06:43 <parsnip>	*because
Jul 11 11:08:43 <hortiel>	but clearly C-u 70 command ; takes command as the argument, and repeats it 70 times, why not this one. 
Jul 11 11:09:03 <hortiel>	C-u 70 i ; this writes i 70 times
Jul 11 11:09:41 <parsnip>	hortiel: i offered <f3,4> since you might want to do less trivial things in the future.
Jul 11 11:10:09 <parsnip>	and i guess i was wondering myself what all ways there were to repeat stuff.
Jul 11 11:10:34 <parsnip>	i've never really needed C-u 70, but nice to know it works with <f3,4>, iiuc
Jul 11 11:11:05 <hortiel>	ok, what's a macro? why does it works that way. 
Jul 11 11:11:31 <hortiel>	I came to emacs last week, though, and intend to check out org mode, after i have done enriched mode.

Jul 11 15:56:01 <rpav>	why is there a huge delay in responsiveness when spawning a process
Jul 11 15:56:27 <rpav>	using async-shell-command
Jul 11 15:56:47 <rpav>	i can see a minor hitch as the fork and setup happens, but it's like, 5 seconds
Jul 11 15:56:57 <bremner>	don't see that here. OS? shell?
Jul 11 15:57:19 <rpav>	linux, x86_64, and i'm not sure what shell it spawns .. bash?
Jul 11 15:58:31 <rpav>	it doesn't *always* seem to happen, mostly when the shell in question is doing nontrivial work (in this case starting a build)
Jul 11 16:00:58 <bremner>	huh. Does the same build command do it consistently?
Jul 11 16:01:33 <bremner>	is it some fancy build tool like cmake? I tried make here and it seemed OK.
Jul 11 16:05:41 <rpav>	cmake just spits out makefiles
Jul 11 16:05:52 <rpav>	this is definitely once it's running make

Jul 11 19:20:26 <greenline>	M'Expressions
Jul 11 19:21:21 <johnjay>	Mexpressions is a nice restaurant name
Jul 11 19:21:51 <greenline>	Mexicali Express is a place that exists. Now I wonder if their menu is data.
Jul 11 19:24:29 <fledermaus>	there's a new place opening up that's on my route to work. casa maramureseana 
Jul 11 19:24:38 <fledermaus>	not sure they've thought that name through.
Jul 11 19:25:24 <fledermaus>	just cos people will find it hard to say/spell here 
Jul 11 19:26:19 <bremner>	globally it seems to be a popular resto name
Jul 11 19:26:23 <parsnip>	almost ten syllables
Jul 11 19:26:26 <fledermaus>	yeah, I just searched for it.
Jul 11 19:26:37 <fledermaus>	romanian cuisine, apparently.
Jul 11 19:27:13 <johnjay>	casa de wasa the masa
Jul 11 19:34:21 <johnjay>	wait everytime you open a file emacs searches up the entire directory tree for a .dir-locals.el file?
Jul 11 19:38:35 <kenrestivo>	that would explain a lot of slowness
Jul 11 19:38:43 <kenrestivo>	i.e. on ssh or fusermount or such
Jul 11 19:39:05 <tromey>	there's some caching and I think a special setting for tramp
Jul 11 19:39:15 <johnjay>	i created foo/bar/a.txt and foo/baz/b.txt in /tmp and when i opened b.txt it found the .dir-locals.el in foo
Jul 11 19:40:18 <kenrestivo>	i pity the foo
Jul 11 19:41:35 <Inline>	you emptied the bar too ?
Jul 11 19:41:38 <Inline>	lol
Jul 11 19:41:41 <kenrestivo>	lol
Jul 11 19:42:23 <johnjay>	honestly there's gotta be an elisp function that takes a list and creates a directory tree based on that list
Jul 11 19:42:58 <kenrestivo>	like, mkdir -p ?
Jul 11 19:43:20 <johnjay>	e.g. (foo (bar (a.txt)) (baz (b.txt)))
Jul 11 19:43:39 <johnjay>	kenrestivo: ah that's a good point
Jul 11 19:47:41 <JordiGH>	lol

Jul 11 19:52:21 <fsbot>	Added note [6] for term "lol"
Jul 11 19:54:22 <johnjay>	is there a function that returns a symbol's name, function slot, value, and plist all at once?
Jul 11 19:54:36 <tromey>	I don't think so
Jul 11 19:54:44 <johnjay>	oh well
Jul 11 19:58:05 <parsnip>	hmm, not getting notifations for issues filed at my baby
Jul 11 19:59:01 <parsnip>	ah, "Not watching"
Jul 11 19:59:18 <johnjay>	i'm imagining people filing issues on github for a newborn
Jul 11 19:59:22 *	johnjay decides to take a break
Jul 11 20:03:41 <parsnip>	is there a fancy name for "user" when described by free software foundation folks?
Jul 11 20:03:54 <parsnip>	i know they say a facebook user is a "used"
Jul 11 20:03:54 <wasamasa>	liberator
Jul 11 20:04:43 <parsnip>	haha, the user is liberating the code from the author?
Jul 11 20:05:36 <parsnip>	or is that just your favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?
Jul 11 20:08:54 <wasamasa>	that's just a joke
Jul 11 20:09:21 <wasamasa>	it's even funnier considering I took a deep dive into this library: https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator
Jul 11 20:14:58 <JordiGH>	Hm, now we need a good reason to name a library Erator.
Jul 11 20:15:50 <fledermaus>	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blakes+7+liberator&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images
Jul 11 20:16:15 <JordiGH>	Is that some fancy multi syringe?
Jul 11 20:16:22 <parsnip>	that's just a joke back!
Jul 11 20:16:26 <parsnip>	your face!
Jul 11 20:17:02 <fledermaus>	JordiGH: you don't recognise the ship leading the resistance against the evil federation?
Jul 11 20:17:43 <fledermaus>	(The joke was always that Star Trek was pro-federation propaganda and Blake's 7 was the dark, gritty truth of the resistance)
Jul 11 20:17:48 <JordiGH>	It's starting to look like some weapon against anti-vaxxers.
Jul 11 20:18:17 <JordiGH>	fledermaus: Son, I don't trek on stars.
Jul 11 20:18:49 <fledermaus>	MENTIROSO
Jul 11 20:19:57 <parsnip>	would it be rude to capitalize the issue title someone filed?
Jul 11 20:20:19 <JordiGH>	Edit mercilessly.
Jul 11 20:20:20 <parsnip>	"created file is hidden"
Jul 11 20:20:24 <parsnip>	ruthless
Jul 11 20:20:30 <parsnip>	have you no compassion
Jul 11 20:20:50 <parsnip>	f*** it, i did it
Jul 11 20:21:09 <parsnip>	ignored the rest of the bad grammar
Jul 11 20:21:26 <parsnip>	wait, should i edit the grammar there too?
Jul 11 20:21:50 <parsnip>	naw
Jul 11 20:21:52 <JordiGH>	I approve of syntax fascism.
Jul 11 20:21:58 <hortiel_>	C-x C-h says displays cmd that begin with C-x, but when I search for the meta cmd using C-h k and then typing the using it says that key sequence is not defined!!
Jul 11 20:22:07 <hortiel_>	but clearly C-x C-h is defined
Jul 11 20:22:19 <JordiGH>	C-h is kind of special.
Jul 11 20:22:23 <JordiGH>	It's the help key.
Jul 11 20:22:28 <hortiel_>	yes
Jul 11 20:22:32 <JordiGH>	C-x C-h isn't defined; C-h is.
Jul 11 20:22:52 <JordiGH>	C-h interrupts a prefix to tell you what keys have this prefix.
Jul 11 20:23:13 <hortiel_>	M-x C-h doesn't work that way though? why not
Jul 11 20:23:22 <JordiGH>	M-x isn't a prefix.
Jul 11 20:24:07 <JordiGH>	That is a single key bound to run-command or something.
Jul 11 20:24:28 <hortiel_>	thx. 
Jul 11 20:25:18 <hortiel_>	and one more thing, I erased my .emacs* files , so lost the coloring and do you find white too bad, especially when selecting text, it barely displays the select text in a different shade.
Jul 11 20:25:56 <hortiel_>	I set set-background-color to black but lose my changes upon reboot 
Jul 11 20:27:08 <JordiGH>	Hm, are you using Emacs on a terminal? The default colours should have enough contrast
Jul 11 20:27:12 <hortiel_>	gui 
Jul 11 20:27:37 <hortiel_>	but can i make custom changes to my colors
Jul 11 20:27:41 <JordiGH>	Anyway, you need a init.el or .emacs to save your colours; if that's gone, no colours when you restart Emacs.
Jul 11 20:27:42 <hortiel_>	they don't persist
Jul 11 20:27:53 <JordiGH>	I've heard of this not persisting problem before with Spacemacs.
Jul 11 20:27:56 <JordiGH>	Are you using Spacemacs?
Jul 11 20:28:09 <hortiel_>	gnuemacs
Jul 11 20:28:28 <JordiGH>	Do you see changes to your .emacs or init.el?
Jul 11 20:28:34 <hortiel_>	nope
Jul 11 20:28:40 <JordiGH>	How are you setting them?
Jul 11 20:28:55 <hortiel_>	don't
Jul 11 20:29:06 <JordiGH>	You... are not changing the colours at all?
Jul 11 20:29:26 <hortiel_>	I am using M-x set-background-color black
Jul 11 20:30:31 <JordiGH>	Well, put (set-background-colour 'black) in your .emacs
Jul 11 20:30:34 <kenrestivo>	hmm, i used (set-frame-parameter item 'background-color "black")
Jul 11 20:30:37 <JordiGH>	Or maybe "black"
Jul 11 20:30:53 <kenrestivo>	walking thru (frame-list), that is
Jul 11 20:31:18 <JordiGH>	Why walk through it?
Jul 11 20:31:24 <JordiGH>	Just use the same function.
Jul 11 20:31:29 <kenrestivo>	because running would be too fast
Jul 11 20:31:47 <JordiGH>	Oh, comedy.
Jul 11 20:32:00 <kenrestivo>	i suspect i wrote my .emacs before set-background-color was a function
Jul 11 20:32:44 <JordiGH>	Hello fellow Ancient One; I too call it .emacs instead of init.el
Jul 11 20:32:46 <hortiel_>	earlier I didn't write any code in any config file, how did it persist.?
Jul 11 20:32:49 <parsnip>	but now little set-background-color is all grown up
Jul 11 20:32:53 <hortiel_>	don't remember what I did 
Jul 11 20:32:58 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Maybe you used M-x customize-face
Jul 11 20:33:23 <parsnip>	shouldn't this show verion percentages? https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
Jul 11 20:35:51 <hortiel_>	yes, I used in the menu though. customize theme not face as theme applies to background 
Jul 11 20:36:58 <hortiel_>	hey what's the other way to set-xxx without write code in config file?
Jul 11 20:39:48 <kenrestivo>	i thank you all very much for pointing me to themes. much better than the custom face crap i had in there before
Jul 11 20:40:13 <hortiel_>	kenrestivo: I was the one who uses themes. 
Jul 11 20:40:46 <hortiel_>	if one uses , enriched mode, does set-xxx persist?
Jul 11 20:41:09 <hortiel_>	I just wanto first try set-xxx without writing code??
Jul 11 20:41:10 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Jul 11 20:42:46 <JordiGH>	"without writing code", Emacs might not be for you.
Jul 11 20:42:56 <JordiGH>	http://notinventedhe.re/on/2010-1-20
Jul 11 20:44:32 <JordiGH>	The customize option from the menu just writes the code for you.
Jul 11 20:47:08 <JordiGH>	Maybe one of these days I should figure out how to use themes.
Jul 11 20:47:28 <JordiGH>	This still works for me: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/file/@/dotemacs.el#l479
Jul 11 20:48:08 <kenrestivo>	so, if i'm using themes, how would i still customze the font sizes?
Jul 11 20:49:45 <bremner>	hortiel_: I suspect very few people here use enriched-mode
Jul 11 20:52:29 <hortiel_>	why not
Jul 11 20:52:52 <hortiel_>	enriched mode is like the very beginning of it. at least for beginners like me.
Jul 11 20:52:56 <bremner>	the format it edits is not consumed by anything else that I am aware of
Jul 11 20:53:03 <hortiel_>	wat
Jul 11 20:53:35 <hortiel_>	then which they use? org mode? enriched mode is much simpler to understand first
Jul 11 20:54:35 <hortiel_>	I did M-x customize-face match ; so it should display hightlight match fonts, but in file it doesn't , I also click apply for other sessions too to make it persist... but no such match face shown.
Jul 11 20:56:06 <hortiel_>	alt+o b ; but bold does not persist...
Jul 11 20:56:36 <hortiel_>	I want my features to be usable... emacs is not doing even the basics. Can you point me to a manual that can guide me.
Jul 11 20:57:26 <JordiGH>	,dk M-o
Jul 11 20:57:26 <fsbot>	facemenu-keymap is a sparse keymap in `facemenu.el'.
Jul 11 20:57:26 <fsbot>	Not documented.
Jul 11 20:57:37 <JordiGH>	Huh, I didn't know about this.
Jul 11 20:58:22 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Well, there's the Emacs manual, but I think you're trying to use a subset of Emacs features in a particular way.
Jul 11 20:58:47 <JordiGH>	I don't really understand what you're using, org-mode? Something else? I haven't seen org-mode users who dislike sexps.
Jul 11 20:59:48 <hortiel_>	since themes tat I selected write the code for me in .emacs file, why can't emacs do the same for other settings...I am sure emacs can
Jul 11 21:00:01 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: I am using no mode
Jul 11 21:00:24 <hortiel_>	although I can use enriched mode, if you say so, since it's easy, very easy
Jul 11 21:00:31 <JordiGH>	Emacs always has a mode.
Jul 11 21:00:42 <hortiel_>	i know, what is sexps, 
Jul 11 21:01:02 <JordiGH>	A sexp is a symbolic expression, what lisp is made out of. These (things (written in) parens).
Jul 11 21:01:33 <hortiel_>	those are list expressions. did you mean S-expressions? 
Jul 11 21:01:46 <JordiGH>	sexps, yeah, S-expressions.
Jul 11 21:01:51 <hortiel_>	looks like it, too many acronyms.
Jul 11 21:02:04 <hortiel_>	I like sexps
Jul 11 21:02:12 <fiddlerwoaroof>	Does anyone use tide-mode for javascript? and, have you had issues with timeouts while completing?
Jul 11 21:02:22 <hortiel_>	I am from python background.
Jul 11 21:02:25 <JordiGH>	So anyway, Emacs isn't generally meant to be configured without writing stuff into your .emacs/init.el file.
Jul 11 21:02:54 <JordiGH>	A lot of people actually dislike customize because it tries to automatically write stuff into your .emacs
Jul 11 21:03:36 <Sketch>	it's actually kind of surprising at how well customize works even when you modify your .emacs manually
Jul 11 21:03:56 <JordiGH>	And I guess other than customize, I don't know how else to put stuff into your .emacs without writing it yourself. A lot of Emacs libraries use defcustom to hook their config variables into Customize, but not everything is there.
Jul 11 21:03:59 <fiddlerwoaroof>	I set my custom-file to ~/.emacs.d/custom.el
Jul 11 21:04:08 <fiddlerwoaroof>	And then load-file that on startup.
Jul 11 21:04:18 <bremner>	yes, seperate custom-file should really be the default
Jul 11 21:04:18 <Howitzer105mm>	fiddlerwoaroof: You beat me to it.
Jul 11 21:04:38 <fiddlerwoaroof>	That way I don't mix generated code and manual code
Jul 11 21:05:41 <JordiGH>	I just have one big ol' .emacs and it's not that big.
Jul 11 21:06:19 <fiddlerwoaroof>	I usually eventually move settings I like from custom.el to a use-package form, though
Jul 11 21:08:42 <Sketch>	i have a big ol' emacs and i still use customize, though i have a few additions split out into separate files too
Jul 11 21:09:03 <JordiGH>	Speaking of which, I should probably do some tidying, brb.
Jul 11 21:09:15 <bremner>	uhoh, monkjan is home
Jul 11 21:09:27 <hortiel_>	but why they dont use enriched mode? I think it's enriched enough.
Jul 11 21:09:39 <Sketch>	don't want her see how dirty the .emacs.d is?
Jul 11 21:09:45 <bremner>	hortiel_: what do you want to use enriched mode _for_ ?
Jul 11 21:09:46 <hortiel_>	in org mode too will I be forced to write code to persist my changes?
Jul 11 21:09:57 <hortiel_>	bremner: to persist to persist.....
Jul 11 21:10:01 <bremner>	writing documents that only you will read is, uh, eccentric
Jul 11 21:10:16 <bremner>	but if that's your use case, knock yourself out
Jul 11 21:10:59 <hortiel_>	well those are not latex files, so no it's not source documents, but graphics.. like colors, life without colors is not what I want, othewise I'd have gone for latex. 
Jul 11 21:11:28 <hortiel_>	or html code
Jul 11 21:11:42 <hortiel_>	what you see is what you get is what I need. not html code
Jul 11 21:12:21 <bremner>	hortiel_: OK. Suppose you finish editing your document. What are you going to do, print it out? send it to a friend?
Jul 11 21:12:25 <hortiel_>	Those are my personal notes not documents . so I don't like latex/html.
Jul 11 21:12:38 <hortiel_>	bremner: to no one. just read it myself.
Jul 11 21:12:42 <bremner>	*shrug*. ok.
Jul 11 21:13:17 <hortiel_>	bremner: but I'd send it to a friend to impress him. 
Jul 11 21:13:27 <bremner>	only if your friend uses emacs
Jul 11 21:14:07 <hortiel_>	no I'd export it to pdf. it's the same thing. or to html.
Jul 11 21:14:28 <hortiel_>	my friend does not even know what the heck is emacs!! let alone use it
Jul 11 21:14:40 <bremner>	and enriched-mode supports pdf output?
Jul 11 21:15:26 <hortiel_>	ask anyone have you heard of emacs, they will say O.0. you ask me can I export- I will say 0.0 no idea 
Jul 11 21:16:06 <fiddlerwoaroof>	You could use htmlize and then something that converts html to pdf
Jul 11 21:16:25 <jfb4>	hi all - elpy-mode related question: how to get the equivalent of go-to-definition (M-. in lisp) or symbol lookup (C-h S) for Python statements keywords (not just code you load) - doesn't seem to be part of elpy or python-mode
Jul 11 21:16:35 <JordiGH>	There, few commits pushed: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/
Jul 11 21:17:15 <hortiel_>	so if I use orgmode and make changes, will I have to write a config file, for like basic stuff... what the heck
Jul 11 21:17:32 <hortiel_>	I will export some one else's config file in that case!
Jul 11 21:18:09 <technomancy>	lol butts https://gitlab.com/marcowahl/lisp-butt-mode
Jul 11 21:18:11 <hortiel_>	did you read teh master emacs in one year guide on github.com? it shows all
Jul 11 21:18:11 <JordiGH>	lol
Jul 11 21:18:40 <hortiel_>	is there a anal mode as well
Jul 11 21:19:06 <greenline>	strict parens ;-)
Jul 11 21:19:21 <parsnip>	was "as" the pun?
Jul 11 21:19:34 <greenline>	err smartparens strict I guess
Jul 11 21:19:38 <Sketch>	til github is pretty much useless in emacs-w3m
Jul 11 21:19:38 <parsnip>	hortiel_: *an anal
Jul 11 21:19:54 <JordiGH>	wut wut
Jul 11 21:20:13 <greenline>	> til github is pretty much useless
Jul 11 21:20:33 <Sketch>	sorry, gitlab, not github
Jul 11 21:20:43 <Sketch>	though that may be true as well
Jul 11 21:20:48 <technomancy>	Sketch: yeah their UI is very JS heavy and bad
Jul 11 21:20:51 <technomancy>	(but I repeat myself)
Jul 11 21:21:06 <hortiel_>	I am upset at emacs... that you have left me any choice to persist my changes, without writing code in elisp
Jul 11 21:21:11 <technomancy>	github mostly works without js as long as you don't use their code review system
Jul 11 21:21:23 <technomancy>	in fact, it works better without js
Jul 11 21:21:35 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: You needed more changes than those provided by Customize?
Jul 11 21:21:36 <greenline>	We have many users who are shocked to find out that one can git without github
Jul 11 21:21:37 <Sketch>	if you use customize, you can persist your changes with customize.  otherwise, how are you making changes without "writing code" int he first place?
Jul 11 21:21:43 <technomancy>	because they don't do their stupid "C-k does a useless markdown thing" bit
Jul 11 21:21:44 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: yes
Jul 11 21:21:52 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: I am sorry for your lots.
Jul 11 21:22:03 <hortiel_>	no I am what is cutomize, maybe I misread
Jul 11 21:22:16 <Sketch>	M-x customize
Jul 11 21:22:23 <technomancy>	customize is a trap to trick newbies into thinking they don't need to write code
Jul 11 21:22:29 <hortiel_>	M-x customize-face match ; but it doesn't customize I see the same crap in the tutorial!! 
Jul 11 21:22:35 <hortiel_>	it doesn't work at all
Jul 11 21:22:40 <JordiGH>	technomancy: I really want Firefox to ban websites from binding keys.
Jul 11 21:22:53 <JordiGH>	I have never though, ah, yes, your stupid keyboard shortcuts defined via js, this is what I really wanted in my life.
Jul 11 21:23:04 <JordiGH>	Not even once.
Jul 11 21:23:12 <hortiel_>	try it JordiGH and tell me if it shows beautiful pink highlight in `match` format. JordiGH ???
Jul 11 21:23:13 <fsbot>	Signs point to yes!
Jul 11 21:23:14 <Sketch>	that was one nice thing about conkeror
Jul 11 21:23:23 <technomancy>	JordiGH: this is why I have exwm to protect me
Jul 11 21:23:39 <technomancy>	you have no power over my C-k, stupid web sites!
Jul 11 21:24:01 *	technomancy casts "avert"
Jul 11 21:24:09 <Howitzer105mm>	What does C-k do on web sites?
Jul 11 21:24:16 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Where'd you even come up with this face name?
Jul 11 21:24:36 <hortiel_>	M-x list-faces-display ; chose match
Jul 11 21:24:40 <technomancy>	Howitzer105mm: on github it does something stupid like insert []() for a link
Jul 11 21:24:46 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ? have you even seen the list?
Jul 11 21:25:00 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Which list?
Jul 11 21:25:02 <technomancy>	which is stupid because the whole point of markdown is that it's plain text and you don't need rich text editor support
Jul 11 21:25:07 <Howitzer105mm>	Oh... so if you're using a Markdown web editor....
Jul 11 21:25:08 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: What are you trying to match?
Jul 11 21:25:16 <technomancy>	Howitzer105mm: if you're using github, you don't get a choice
Jul 11 21:25:24 <technomancy>	it's infuriating
Jul 11 21:25:24 <JordiGH>	Oh, list-faces-display
Jul 11 21:25:33 <JordiGH>	That's a shitload of faces.
Jul 11 21:25:44 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: How do you know which one of these faces you want?
Jul 11 21:26:06 <hodapp>	rudybot: silicon. saline. poison. inject me, baby, I'm a free bitch.
Jul 11 21:26:12 <rudybot>	hodapp: With a saline resistant nano paint!
Jul 11 21:26:12 <hodapp>	clearly, rudybot is in need of more Lady Gaga lyrics.
Jul 11 21:26:38 <hodapp>	rudybot: STAHP TELEPHONING ME >:O
Jul 11 21:26:38 <rudybot>	hodapp: when did telephoning change from asking an operator to connect you to a number to direct-dialling? during the war?
Jul 11 21:26:51 <JordiGH>	hodapp: Hey, where have all of the matrix questions gone?
Jul 11 21:26:58 <hodapp>	JordiGH: Ehhh?
Jul 11 21:27:04 <hodapp>	JordiGH: did you take the blue pill or the red pill?
Jul 11 21:27:10 <JordiGH>	idk, it's like you don't even care anymore
Jul 11 21:27:18 <JordiGH>	We used to be so tight, talking maths.
Jul 11 21:27:23 <JordiGH>	Now, not even a postcard.
Jul 11 21:27:25 <JordiGH>	;_;
Jul 11 21:27:37 <Sketch>	technomancy: you don't have to use the web editor for code, though
Jul 11 21:27:38 <Sketch>	luckily
Jul 11 21:28:53 <Sketch>	it's also nice that they have a CLI tool to let you make pull requests
Jul 11 21:28:55 <technomancy>	Sketch: yes, but at work I can't get around using the code review features
Jul 11 21:29:13 <hodapp>	JordiGH: I dunno, but if I get back into renderers and shit, I might have some more.
Jul 11 21:29:16 <hodapp>	also in the process of learning Julia.
Jul 11 21:29:17 <technomancy>	the pull request CLI is nice but it's frustrating that we can't just use email
Jul 11 21:29:21 <Sketch>	yeah, you still have to use the web to view code and comment/merge (i think)
Jul 11 21:29:27 *	hodapp randomly tears a book on R in half and shoves it into rudybot
Jul 11 21:29:39 <technomancy>	merging is easy without the web site but commenting on specific pieces of code isn't
Jul 11 21:29:57 <technomancy>	you can use email to comment on the entire PR as a whole but not on a line-by-line basis
Jul 11 21:30:19 <parsnip>	any one using JellyBean
Jul 11 21:30:25 <Sketch>	hmm, i should figure out how to merge with hub
Jul 11 21:30:32 <technomancy>	rudybot: is Julia named after the Beatles song?
Jul 11 21:30:36 <rudybot>	technomancy: [google]    http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/lovely-rita-lyrics-the-beatles/5da44f309abd5c0548256bc20013e931
Jul 11 21:30:37 <technomancy>	Sketch: not with hub, just with git
Jul 11 21:30:41 <Sketch>	oh
Jul 11 21:30:57 <JordiGH>	What *is* Julia named after?
Jul 11 21:31:16 <bremner>	the song from the eurithmics album 1984
Jul 11 21:31:22 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: i did M-x customize-face highlight and then clicked on apply and without closing emacs switched to TUTORIAL still nothing 
Jul 11 21:31:37 <Sketch>	technomancy: even when the repo requres approval for merging?
Jul 11 21:31:38 <hodapp>	JordiGH: probably the fractal.
Jul 11 21:31:44 <hodapp>	maybe the marijuana.
Jul 11 21:31:47 <JordiGH>	Apparently it's named after nothing
Jul 11 21:31:51 <technomancy>	Sketch: oh, no idea
Jul 11 21:31:56 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: how do i know which faces? I saw their beauty
Jul 11 21:32:02 <technomancy>	Sketch: depends on the protections to the master branch, I guess
Jul 11 21:32:12 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Are you trying to change the faced named "match"? Do you know where this face is used?
Jul 11 21:32:13 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: match and highlight appears goood
Jul 11 21:32:34 <JordiGH>	Are you trying to in fact change the isearch face?
Jul 11 21:33:08 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: just experimenting M-x facemenu-set-face match ; works but not with M-x customize ? 
Jul 11 21:33:14 <Sketch>	technomancy: ah, neat, it works.
Jul 11 21:33:31 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: How are you telling customize to save it, for all future sessions?
Jul 11 21:33:33 <JordiGH>	And this session?
Jul 11 21:33:35 <hortiel_>	no I want to display that "match" cool face when i type
Jul 11 21:33:39 <Sketch>	git checkout master; git merge my-approved-branch ; git push
Jul 11 21:33:51 <hortiel_>	yes told it save future sessions as well, still nothing
Jul 11 21:34:04 <JordiGH>	Erm, anyone else who knows Emacs: where is the "match" face used? Can you explain what hortiel_ is doing?
Jul 11 21:34:14 <hortiel_>	maybe my earlier theme is interfereing? but it said saved in ~/emacs.d/...
Jul 11 21:34:25 <hortiel_>	so clearly it got save as well
Jul 11 21:35:22 <hortiel_>	i don't care where match is used I tried with highlight as well, it works in facemenu-set-face but not with customize-face highlight 
Jul 11 21:35:42 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: you try it yourself, and see the results in front of your eyes, i am not lying.
Jul 11 21:36:02 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: I have no idea wtf you're doing and you lack the Emacs vocabulary to explain it. I'm hoping someone else can explain it.
Jul 11 21:36:34 <JordiGH>	Can you perhaps show a video with your recorded keystrokes?
Jul 11 21:39:27 <twrk>	can you see results behind your eyes?
Jul 11 21:42:09 <hortiel_>	https://i.imgur.com/6he6S4J.png
Jul 11 21:42:29 <hortiel_>	twrk: no but you can see the results in front of your eyes!!
Jul 11 21:44:25 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/5wvgg4A.png
Jul 11 21:46:33 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: Which mode are you changing the face highlighting. i.e. what is that pages parent?
Jul 11 21:46:43 <JordiGH>	What is the highlight face anyway?
Jul 11 21:46:44 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/7BFY3f2.png https://imgur.com/bMQfrLu.png
Jul 11 21:47:18 <JordiGH>	Hm, hl-line mode seems to use the highlight face.
Jul 11 21:47:28 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: What are you expecting in the tutorial buffer to use the higlight face?
Jul 11 21:47:53 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: didn't you find the red-face beautifuL? it's pretty attractive
Jul 11 21:48:05 <JordiGH>	Okay, so how are you doing that?
Jul 11 21:48:11 <JordiGH>	What is "highlighting"?
Jul 11 21:48:17 <hortiel_>	I want that attractive face using M-x customize-face match 
Jul 11 21:48:32 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: what are you babbling. I just want that face, it's looks pretty
Jul 11 21:48:40 <JordiGH>	What are you doing to set that face and what are you doing in the tutorial buffer to change the face to that red face?
Jul 11 21:48:46 <JordiGH>	Okay.
Jul 11 21:48:50 <JordiGH>	A face is a property of text.
Jul 11 21:48:59 <JordiGH>	Each character on your screen has a face.
Jul 11 21:49:14 <JordiGH>	M-x describe-face will tell you what the face at the current cursor position is.
Jul 11 21:49:20 <hortiel_>	yes you told me to customize and now you keep question  why I do this. because it's looks sexy. 
Jul 11 21:49:33 <JordiGH>	In order to change text looks, you have to change their face.
Jul 11 21:49:56 <hortiel_>	yes, I did change face using M-x customize but nothing happened.
Jul 11 21:50:13 <JordiGH>	I am asking you: what is the name of the red face, how did you activate this face, and how did you change this face's properties to have a red background?
Jul 11 21:50:33 <hortiel_>	as I showed you the proof, and it says it saved it in ~/.emacs and still doesn't even work, let alone persist after boot .
Jul 11 21:50:43 <JordiGH>	I will repeat the question.
Jul 11 21:50:48 <hortiel_>	M-x facemenu-set-face match 
Jul 11 21:51:08 <JordiGH>	How did you set this text's face to red face? And what is this face's name?
Jul 11 21:51:16 <hortiel_>	M-x facemenu-set-face match 
Jul 11 21:51:17 <JordiGH>	What did you do, did you drag the mouse across the buffer?
Jul 11 21:51:22 <hortiel_>	it's name is "match"
Jul 11 21:51:42 <JordiGH>	No, "M-x facemenu-set-face match" answers the question, "how did you set the face's properties".
Jul 11 21:51:49 <JordiGH>	I'm not asking now how you set the face's properties.
Jul 11 21:52:22 <JordiGH>	I'm asking, how did you change the face those characters are using? They had a different face with a dark blue background before (which has some other name), and you changed their face to a face with a red background.
Jul 11 21:52:31 <JordiGH>	What action did you do to change the face of those characters?
Jul 11 21:54:50 <hortiel_>	maybe you are on spacemacs so it's different for you. On gnuemacs faces like match and highlight change the background to Red and Blue respectively. 
Jul 11 21:55:02 <JordiGH>	Wait.
Jul 11 21:55:03 <JordiGH>	Argh.
Jul 11 21:55:05 <hortiel_>	other faces don't
Jul 11 21:55:11 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: You have set the HIGHTLIGHT face?
Jul 11 21:55:15 <JordiGH>	facemenu-set-face doesn't change the face's properties.
Jul 11 21:55:25 <JordiGH>	facemenu-set-face changes the face of the characters.
Jul 11 21:55:35 <JordiGH>	character -> face -> colours
Jul 11 21:55:48 <JordiGH>	You're modifying the (character -> face) relationship with facemenu-set-face
Jul 11 21:56:08 <JordiGH>	You are modifying the (face -> colours) relationship with Customize.
Jul 11 21:56:47 <JordiGH>	It's two different things.
Jul 11 21:56:58 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: And it appears he's changed the Highlight in the Customize mode to a magenta.
Jul 11 21:58:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: In theory, if you put your cursor at the beginning of the first line in your buffer, and then Shift->right arrow, each right arrow click will highlight your text in magenta.
Jul 11 21:58:44 <Howitzer105mm>	You have to actually "highlight" the text for the font to change color
Jul 11 21:59:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Hm, are you sure that's the right face for tmm?
Jul 11 21:59:19 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: What's tmm
Jul 11 21:59:28 <JordiGH>	transient-mark-mode, the thing that shows the region.
Jul 11 21:59:33 <Howitzer105mm>	Ah...
Jul 11 21:59:35 <JordiGH>	I disable it.
Jul 11 21:59:55 <JordiGH>	But I see blue when I enable tmm and my highlight face is grey.
Jul 11 21:59:56 <Howitzer105mm>	Well I don't know which sub-tree he's set the highlight face to.
Jul 11 22:00:29 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/27vtpYh.png I typed as you said M-x describe-face ; then it said Describe face (default 'default'):   ;and the cursor is waiting for me to RET so I did , and got that window. No idea what a face is. 
Jul 11 22:00:43 <Howitzer105mm>	I have not modified my highlight face. So when I set a mark, and move the cursor I get light on sky blue text
Jul 11 22:00:54 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: A face is a property of a character. A colour is a property of a face.
Jul 11 22:01:09 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face never told me what the face at the current cursor posittion is ... it kept quiet
Jul 11 22:01:13 <Howitzer105mm>	Loosely speaking Face -> Font
Jul 11 22:01:31 <Howitzer105mm>	You have not actually HIGHLIGHED anything in your buffer
Jul 11 22:01:46 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: And your highlight face has a blue background?
Jul 11 22:01:48 <Howitzer105mm>	Click and drag your mouse across your first line of text
Jul 11 22:01:55 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: yes
Jul 11 22:02:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: i.e. Hightlight your text, as in any other X11 program
Jul 11 22:02:32 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: The face name it shows you before you hit <RET> is the face name at the current position.
Jul 11 22:02:53 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: What's the colour? Like, its name or hex value.
Jul 11 22:03:09 <JordiGH>	Why did I modify my highlight face to grey but tmm is showing blue?
Jul 11 22:03:19 <Howitzer105mm>	Uhhh... I don't have the magic incantation to determine that
Jul 11 22:03:21 <hortiel_>	ok when I change the customize option to green, the M-x facemenu-set-face too shows green in highlight for some reason.
Jul 11 22:03:29 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: If you try describe-face on the red background, I expect you'll see a different name suggested by M-x describe-face
Jul 11 22:03:41 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: M-x describe-face highlight
Jul 11 22:04:30 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: You're changing the face's properties in Customize but you're changing the characters' properties in facemenu-set-face
Jul 11 22:05:03 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ok it says Describe face (default 'match'):   ; and waits for my input.
Jul 11 22:05:13 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ok
Jul 11 22:05:15 <hortiel_>	got it
Jul 11 22:05:16 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Right, because you changed the face of those characters to be the match face.
Jul 11 22:05:49 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Interesting, when I move my tmm I get text with a blue background, yet highlight in my cpp buffer says the background is darkolivegreen
Jul 11 22:06:45 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Though my foreground-color is green3 and my background is black, so I don't know how that affects what emacs does.
Jul 11 22:07:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: That's because I don't think tmm is using the highlight face. I don't know *what* face it's using.
Jul 11 22:07:58 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Ah, I think it's the region face.
Jul 11 22:08:42 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Changing to black foreground, white background, highlight changes to darkseagreen2.  My tmm shading appears light gray
Jul 11 22:09:00 <Howitzer105mm>	with some transparency
Jul 11 22:09:21 <hortiel_>	what's tmm and cpp buffer Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 22:09:51 <Howitzer105mm>	Ah.... that is the "region" face
Jul 11 22:10:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Well, setting the region face to hotpink gives me https://jordi.platinum.edu.pl/piccies/Screenshot.png
Jul 11 22:10:32 <JordiGH>	tmm is transient-mark-mode, the thing that shows the region. 
Jul 11 22:10:39 <JordiGH>	The region is the place between the mark and point.
Jul 11 22:10:43 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: tmm = transient mark mode, which is Emacs speak for the area highlighted between "point" and "mark"
Jul 11 22:10:55 <JordiGH>	The point is the location between characters indicated by the cursor.
Jul 11 22:11:03 <Howitzer105mm>	cpp = the C plus plus language, which has nothing to do with the issue
Jul 11 22:11:25 <JordiGH>	So you set a mark, you move the point, and the region between it gets highlighted a different colour by tmm.
Jul 11 22:11:55 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: "region" face changes to blue3 background using my normal color scheme
Jul 11 22:12:12 <JordiGH>	Yeah, idk.
Jul 11 22:12:41 <JordiGH>	I gotta go home, hit the gym.
Jul 11 22:12:52 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Have fun!
Jul 11 22:17:49 <hortiel_>	when I write in terminal tty1 , say, what is the color of the face? since face is the aura around the character I assume it is black in tty virtual console?
Jul 11 22:22:08 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: What is displayed in a xterm, gnome-session, konsole all depends upon a variety of factors.  Try to stay focused upon the program you are trying to configure, not on programs you aren't
Jul 11 22:26:10 <solrize>	hi i upgraded to debian 10 and my emacs docs went away.  some web search indicates they are in a nonfree package because of the gfdl (sheesh) but i can't find that either
Jul 11 22:26:16 <solrize>	e.g. emacs24-common-non-dfsg
Jul 11 22:26:21 <solrize>	or the current version 26
Jul 11 22:26:39 <solrize>	(or 25 for that matter).  anyone been hearing about this?
Jul 11 22:30:02 <hortiel_>	Howitzer105mm: how long you been emacsing
Jul 11 22:30:14 <hortiel_>	you seem to ask amateur like me
Jul 11 22:33:17 <hortiel_>	solrize: you lost your configs or what?
Jul 11 22:34:36 <solrize>	not sure what happened on this box but i notice that apt/sources.list is mirrors.kernel.org so maybe that's missing the nonfree repo.  i was about to try updating from ftp.us.debian.org and seeing if that helps.  package is emacs-common-non-dfsg over on another machine .    sec
Jul 11 22:35:22 <solrize>	yeah!  that worked
Jul 11 22:35:23 <solrize>	thanks
Jul 11 22:35:46 <quiliro>	hello
Jul 11 22:35:55 <quiliro>	i am an emacs newbie
Jul 11 22:36:05 <solrize>	welcome quijote 
Jul 11 22:36:11 <solrize>	oops quiliro
Jul 11 22:36:39 <quiliro>	solrize: thank you... it is an alias :-)
Jul 11 22:36:47 <solrize>	oh hehe
Jul 11 22:37:30 <quiliro>	not right now...but i like it
Jul 11 22:37:53 <quiliro>	kiĥote is better for me 
Jul 11 22:38:01 <quiliro>	but that is not what brings me here
Jul 11 22:38:10 <quiliro>	i have a font problem
Jul 11 22:38:25 <quiliro>	 
Jul 11 22:38:25 <quiliro>	😴
Jul 11 22:38:33 <quiliro>	does not display on my emacs
Jul 11 22:39:07 <quiliro>	i do not know what font i must install or configure on emacs for that to display correctly
Jul 11 22:39:19 <average>	quiliro: just get a monospace font that works ok on your side
Jul 11 22:39:35 <average>	quiliro: the minimum effort solution is to use a monospace font already present on your system
Jul 11 22:39:56 <average>	https://gist.github.com/smandy/9440173
Jul 11 22:40:00 <average>	list them like this ^^
Jul 11 22:40:03 <quiliro>	ok....i will research that...thank you average
Jul 11 22:40:16 <quiliro>	nice
Jul 11 22:41:01 <quiliro>	will that work directly on the emacs config file?
Jul 11 22:41:45 <average>	probably
Jul 11 22:41:46 <average>	TIAS
Jul 11 22:42:29 <average>	my guess is that yes they will
Jul 11 22:42:45 <quiliro>	21.8 Fonts 
Jul 11 22:42:52 <quiliro>	says that
Jul 11 22:43:02 <quiliro>	By default, Emacs displays text on graphical displays using a 10-point
Jul 11 22:43:02 <quiliro>	monospace font.
Jul 11 22:43:11 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I've been using Emacs for decades.
Jul 11 22:43:17 <quiliro>	how can i know which font i am using?
Jul 11 22:43:34 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I just don't bother to change the default Face (aka Font).
Jul 11 22:43:50 <quiliro>	oh! fonts are faces?
Jul 11 22:44:02 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 22:44:03 <dale>	average: Is quiliro asking how to display a nice font, or specifically how to get a font that will display emoji?
Jul 11 22:44:20 <quiliro>	dale the latter
Jul 11 22:44:22 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: There is always some new thing to learn
Jul 11 22:44:42 <dale>	quiliro: What OS are you on?
Jul 11 22:44:53 <quiliro>	Guix System
Jul 11 22:45:07 <quiliro>	GNU
Jul 11 22:45:16 <Howitzer105mm>	Faces is the Emacs speak for Font.  There may be some esoteric difference that I don't recognize.
Jul 11 22:45:51 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 22:46:52 <dale>	quiliro: My go-to is to install and use https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts, but I don't hear of many others here using it for some reason.  I *think* this package will try to configure the best fonts for various character ranges, including emoji, and I *think* it will work on Linux.
Jul 11 22:47:03 <dale>	quiliro: (I use that on macOS to configure my fonts, including emoji.)
Jul 11 22:47:50 <quiliro>	dale: thank you...i will study it
Jul 11 22:48:06 <Howitzer105mm>	I just use whatever font is preconfig'd on my distro.  I dislike trying to figure out how to use Linux fonts.  They are not intuitive in my opinion.
Jul 11 22:49:21 <hortiel_>	color on that face persists after boot , but how do I make the face too persist, I'd like to use match face by default? 
Jul 11 22:49:30 <hortiel_>	how to do that without writing code in elisp
Jul 11 22:49:46 <hortiel_>	is there a way using menu bar in emacs ? 
Jul 11 22:50:25 <quiliro>	hortiel_: F10?
Jul 11 22:52:20 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: F10->Options->Customize Emacs->Set Faces....
Jul 11 22:52:59 <Howitzer105mm>	The fonts/colors can be configured here based on Major Mode
Jul 11 22:56:18 <kenrestivo>	small faces
Jul 11 22:57:03 <hortiel_>	which mode
Jul 11 22:57:24 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: What/who are you asking?
Jul 11 22:58:04 <parsnip>	🤏😉
Jul 11 22:58:58 <hortiel_>	the channel.
Jul 11 23:00:31 <hortiel_>	I did go to Customize Emacs but -> Set Faces no such option so instead I went to -> specific face and selected there 
Jul 11 23:02:04 <dale>	parsnip: Hm, I lack a font for "pinching hand" it seems.
Jul 11 23:02:16 <parsnip>	dale: no, it hasn't been released, it was deliberate
Jul 11 23:02:22 <parsnip>	"small faces"
Jul 11 23:02:42 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: if you wanna change the default font you should be able to M-x cu-f <RET> default, then tamper with it however you like and hit 'Apply and Save'...
Jul 11 23:02:44 <hortiel_>	but when I type in tutorial after reboot emacs it's still not showing match face by default? so it shows match face only when I search using C-s and when the text in the tutorial "matches"
Jul 11 23:02:53 <parsnip>	dale: glad someone caught that
Jul 11 23:02:54 <hortiel_>	kiki_lamb: i did
Jul 11 23:02:56 <dale>	parsnip: Ah ha!
Jul 11 23:03:12 <parsnip>	it's just a blank space here
Jul 11 23:03:23 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: hmm. if it's not returning post boot, something's going wrong with the save part. I'd open your .emacs and check to see whether the face is actually getting saved.
Jul 11 23:03:26 <dale>	parsnip: You track unreleased emoji, eh?  Emoji connoisseur?
Jul 11 23:03:37 <parsnip>	lol
Jul 11 23:03:55 <dale>	Thank goodness someone made emojipedia.org.
Jul 11 23:04:00 <parsnip>	dale: we were discussing the new blood emoji, which is kind of a big deal
Jul 11 23:04:05 <dale>	I guess MS must have shipped it already: https://emojipedia.org/pinching-hand/
Jul 11 23:04:07 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: after hitting 'Apply and Save', it should add a block like (custom-set-faces ...) to your .emacs with the settings...
Jul 11 23:04:29 <dale>	parsnip: This is https://emojipedia.org/drop-of-blood/ ?
Jul 11 23:04:33 <parsnip>	yes
Jul 11 23:04:38 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: That's because it is only highlighting for "matches".  That's what that face is supposed to do.
Jul 11 23:04:49 <parsnip>	dale: it was partly pushed for by a "girls" group in UK
Jul 11 23:04:52 <dale>	Serves me right for not having a bouncer with replay.
Jul 11 23:04:52 <Howitzer105mm>	Likewise when you hightlight text, the color will change
Jul 11 23:04:57 <dale>	parsnip: I'm seeing that now.
Jul 11 23:05:15 <dale>	I am an alien with blue blood, they had better support a variant selector for blood color.
Jul 11 23:05:24 <parsnip>	but does microsoft actually have it on any devices?
Jul 11 23:05:30 <parsnip>	lol
Jul 11 23:05:45 <parsnip>	blue lives matter
Jul 11 23:05:51 <parsnip>	how dare you!
Jul 11 23:06:31 <parsnip>	oh, they have groups of emoji for events
Jul 11 23:06:47 <dale>	parsnip: Emojipedia says it was released to Windows 10 users in the May 2019 update, so I guess so?  https://blog.emojipedia.org/windows-10-may-2019-update-emoji-changelog/
Jul 11 23:06:51 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: So for your colors to change, as you have them currently configured, you have to perform some action, such as click/drag (i.e. highlight), or perform some action that displays a text match (i.e. search)
Jul 11 23:06:55 <parsnip>	hmm
Jul 11 23:07:04 <hortiel_>	Howitzer105mm: there are other faces that don't highlight? and the font too appears the same
Jul 11 23:07:17 <parsnip>	🤏🍆
Jul 11 23:07:18 <dale>	This site seems scarily comprehensive.
Jul 11 23:07:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: You have not changed a face that is just always active on "static" text.
Jul 11 23:07:44 <parsnip>	dale: have you also seen sites on kaomoji
Jul 11 23:07:45 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I don't get the drift of your last q
Jul 11 23:08:00 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: if you wanna make a (close to) global change, make sure you're editing the face named 'default'
Jul 11 23:08:04 <hortiel_>	what is the point of faces that don't highlight.
Jul 11 23:08:05 <dale>	parsnip: No, googling...
Jul 11 23:08:21 <hortiel_>	kiki_lamb: will it persist after boot
Jul 11 23:08:21 <parsnip>	vitamin D
Jul 11 23:08:35 <e1f>	omg, is this mystery hilighting discussion still going on?
Jul 11 23:08:58 <parsnip>	e1f: the colors. they are important
Jul 11 23:08:59 <Howitzer105mm>	You can make Emacs display your text in whatever color you want.  You just have to know which face to configure to make it happen.
Jul 11 23:09:06 <Howitzer105mm>	e1f: Uh... yeah.
Jul 11 23:09:14 <parsnip>	let's focus on the UI before the business logic
Jul 11 23:09:30 <Howitzer105mm>	I should really bow out at this stage, as I DON'T do this.
Jul 11 23:09:53 <hortiel_>	let's say I configured successfully face X. but the face X is still not active under the static text after boot...
Jul 11 23:10:13 <hortiel_>	I have to tell emacs to activate the face X under the text
Jul 11 23:10:22 <Howitzer105mm>	The you didn't save it for future sessions per the Customize menu
Jul 11 23:10:24 <hortiel_>	everytime!!
Jul 11 23:10:35 <hortiel_>	I did Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 23:11:17 <dale>	parsnip: http://japaneseemoticons.me/ seems to have a lot of info but also looks like spam.  They do have a mobile app though so they must be legit, right?
Jul 11 23:11:31 <parsnip>	right
Jul 11 23:11:32 <dale>	parsnip: Let's go with http://kaomoji.ru/en/ instead.  Single page Geocities throwback.
Jul 11 23:11:39 <parsnip>	*inorite
Jul 11 23:11:56 <dale>	Unironic usage of Comic Sans FTW.
Jul 11 23:12:07 <dale>	parsnip: Also, TIL "kaomoji".
Jul 11 23:12:54 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face always says default under the tutorial... I customized it 100 times
Jul 11 23:13:39 <hortiel_>	the color is active on that face, but only after I activate the face, otherwise the face itself is default.
Jul 11 23:14:04 <hortiel_>	it never changes. face never changes, only color for that particular face does upon activation. Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 23:15:24 <Illya>	(☆ω☆)
Jul 11 23:16:52 <Howitzer105mm>	So you've gone to the Specific Faces menu from Customize.  Found the >Default: element, changed the content, returned to the top of that page, clicked "Apply and Save", and restarting Emacs fails to pick up the color change.
Jul 11 23:17:25 <Howitzer105mm>	The screen shots you provided showed you changing "Highlight" and "Match", not "Default"
Jul 11 23:24:21 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face ; this shows default Howitzer105mm after C-x C-c 
Jul 11 23:24:57 <hortiel_>	Default: element I guess i didn't change the element. 
Jul 11 23:26:08 <hortiel_>	but enough is enough is for.

Jul 11 23:30:16 <Howitzer105mm>	face-plant
Jul 11 23:30:25 <greenline>	we still talking faces ?

Jul 11 23:43:49 <quiliro>	is there an emacs manual with screenshots?
Jul 11 23:45:03 <Howitzer105mm>	quiliro: None that I know
Jul 11 23:45:12 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 23:45:57 <quiliro>	why does the html manual have nicer fonts than the info manual?
Jul 11 23:47:27 <quiliro>	is it because i use a diferent font on info than on eww?
Jul 11 23:51:33 <quiliro>	another question: can life be lived exclusively on emacs without avoiding use of video and audio?

Jul 11 23:54:39 <parsnip>	quiliro: double negative?
Jul 11 23:55:29 <quiliro>	kenrestivo: thank you for your question...life = email with embedded images, videoconferencing, viewing movies, listening to podcasts, being able to see all web pages, audioconferencing, flipping through photographs by seeing self-generated thumbnails in photo directories, etc

Jul 12 13:56:34 <Miyu-chan>	nice*
Jul 12 14:14:22 <nckx>	Uh hello weird Ayn Rand fanchan: My XKB compose key sometimes stops working in emacs after many hours (very rarely though).  ‘<Multi_Key> is undefined’.  It keeps working outside of emacs (and in ‘emacs -nw’).  Is this familiar to anyone?
Jul 12 14:17:41 <fledermaus>	nckx: first of all, how very dare you. second: no, that's weird. I don't even know how that could happen.
Jul 12 14:18:03 <fledermaus>	if you run xev, has anything changed about the events generated by that key?
Jul 12 14:20:40 <nckx>	Well, I've saved a copy to compare to a clean boot next time I can.
Jul 12 14:22:09 <nckx>	What's unexpected (to me) is that restarting my emacs daemon doesn't fix it.  You may be on to something (that it's not emacs' fault, sorry emacs).  But why do compositions keep working everywhere else‽  (← see?)  Gah…

Jul 12 14:35:00 <sindan>	test
Jul 12 14:36:47 <sindan>	is there some size limit to text copied through Ctrl-w? On slime's REPL if I try to copy a couple thousand lines marking them with Ctrl-Space, then moving over to the end of some structure, then Ctrl-w I get "Saved text until ..." in the minubuffer and the text is not copied.
Jul 12 14:37:13 <sindan>	Don't know if this is a bug
Jul 12 14:41:05 <JordiGH>	sindan: Well, your computer has finite memory, so yeah, there's a limit.
Jul 12 14:41:49 <JordiGH>	C-w wipes, M-w is for only saving to the kill ring.
Jul 12 14:42:02 <JordiGH>	Unless SLIME is somehow overwriting it.
Jul 12 14:42:10 <JordiGH>	What does C-h k C-w say in SLIME?
Jul 12 14:52:06 <sindan>	JordiGH, unless the text in the kill ring is very stupidly stored, a couple thousand lines should not even represent a dent in the memory I have available
Jul 12 14:52:38 <sindan>	It happens both with C-w and M-w
Jul 12 14:53:17 <sindan>	slime doesn't change C-w behaviour
Jul 12 14:54:02 <JordiGH>	sindan: So you're wiping the text, right?
Jul 12 14:54:04 <JordiGH>	Not "copying" it?
Jul 12 14:54:23 <JordiGH>	So when you browse the kill ring, you don't see it there?
Jul 12 14:55:09 <sindan>	No
Jul 12 14:55:22 <sindan>	I don't see it there
Jul 12 14:55:23 <JordiGH>	Huh, okay, this only happens in SLIME buffers?
Jul 12 14:55:37 <JordiGH>	Your kill ring is nicely populated in other buffers?
Jul 12 14:55:48 <sindan>	I don't know, I only copy chunks of text in slime buffers tho
Jul 12 14:56:05 <JordiGH>	Wiping you mean?
Jul 12 14:56:18 <JordiGH>	Well, try it in on another buffer and check your kill ring.
Jul 12 14:56:24 <sindan>	both C-w and M-w
Jul 12 14:57:16 <JordiGH>	I mean, in fundamental-mode or whatever, or in the *scratch* buffer.
Jul 12 15:12:47 <fledermaus>	so. who's in toronto?
Jul 12 15:13:07 <JordiGH>	You, I presume.
Jul 12 15:13:17 <JordiGH>	And sacahc.
Jul 12 15:13:20 <JordiGH>	Er, sachac
Jul 12 15:14:32 <fledermaus>	well, not right now.
Jul 12 15:14:42 <fledermaus>	but it looks like I will be there for TIFF 
Jul 12 15:15:03 <JordiGH>	Please tell me you're a, uh, contestant?
Jul 12 15:15:52 <fledermaus>	no.
Jul 12 15:16:41 <fledermaus>	although why not, am I not allowed to? is that what I am to you, a non-film-making joke? huh? HUH? </pesci>
Jul 12 16:10:38 <hortiel>	I shutdown my OS, how did emacs know that it got to #file# save this file? I saw in my dir there was no such file
Jul 12 16:10:49 <hortiel>	as if emacs did time travel like firefox

Jul 12 16:43:02 <kodein>	,yow
Jul 12 16:43:02 <fsbot>	Then, it's off to RED CHINA!!
Jul 12 16:57:47 <kodein>	rudybot: have you ever been to turquoise china?
Jul 12 16:57:59 <rudybot>	kodein: hi everyone ! I have a problem when apply the color-tango-theme, the background is turquoise instead of dark gray ...  http://db.tt/qQ994sy. I am on OSX, emacs installed from mac ports, using GNU Emacs 23.3.1. 
Jul 12 16:58:09 <hortiel>	how does emacs save file after crash?
Jul 12 16:58:26 <hortiel>	or before crash there is no visible file?? can you see it?
Jul 12 16:59:19 <kodein>	it autosaves as #filename#
Jul 12 16:59:46 <hortiel>	how is emacs doing this magic , I created a new file called 'filename' and there is no #filename@ 
Jul 12 16:59:58 <hortiel>	* #filename# 
Jul 12 17:00:38 <hortiel>	I see nothing it autosaves. and .emacs.d/autosave.. what's that doing it has no files even and some code numbers, don't undertand how emacs is doing it
Jul 12 17:00:56 <hortiel>	but when I crash my pc I reeboot, i see #filename# ???
Jul 12 17:00:56 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Jul 12 17:01:07 <hortiel>	emacs did something 
Jul 12 17:01:35 <kodein>	yes. ,,autosave
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	From memory, AutoSave is [0/5] Try M-x customize-group RET auto-save RET
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[1] controlled by auto-save-list-file-prefix
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[2] controlled by auto-save-file-name-transforms
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[3] (info "(emacs)Auto Save") ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Jul 12 17:02:12 <hortiel>	i mean if I immediately open a new file 'filename' and crash the pc, then will it autosave or fail? how much time does emacs take to autosave? 1sec, 1min?
Jul 12 17:03:32 <kodein>	you can customize it, see above. by default it will autosave if you have been idle for 30 seconds
Jul 12 17:04:12 <hortiel>	ok
Jul 12 17:04:20 <kodein>	it will also do it every five minutes by default
Jul 12 17:05:45 <hortiel>	how did you know 30 sec
Jul 12 17:06:17 <kodein>	I went and looked at the customization settings as directed in 18:01 < fsbot> From memory, AutoSave is [0/5] Try M-x customize-group RET auto-save RET
Jul 12 17:07:32 <hortiel>	i too went there,
Jul 12 17:09:16 <hortiel>	i am having difficulty is it because i am new, i mean i read the whole tutorial
Jul 12 17:10:03 <kodein>	you are able to read the documentation for the different settings and can also see the values there. I will have to correct myself regarding the every 5 minutes thing though, it is every 300 input events, not 300 seconds
Jul 12 17:10:24 <hortiel>	ok i understood
Jul 12 17:11:54 <kodein>	basically when starting out with emacs, (and yes, the tutorial is good), one of the more important skills to learn is where to find the documentation and how to look it up, and I do think you are well on your way to getting there
Jul 12 17:13:10 <kodein>	since a core concept of emacs is "self documentation", it also means that most if not all of what you can do is documented, and being able to look it up helps you understand the workings

Jul 15 19:52:27 <fsbot>	lol
Jul 15 19:54:01 <johnjay>	dale: that looks interesting... although having a file just for one function seems overkill
Jul 15 20:02:10 <aveltras>	is anyone using the weechat mode here ? do notifications work ?
Jul 15 20:10:08 <technomancy>	aveltras: I tried it like a year ago. I found that it wasn't synchronizing unread marks correctly.
Jul 15 20:10:58 <aveltras>	technomancy: do you use something else with emacs ?
Jul 15 20:11:30 <technomancy>	aveltras: I use erc for IRC and just regular weechat for slack at work
Jul 15 20:11:36 <technomancy>	(without weechat.el)
Jul 15 20:12:57 <aveltras>	technomancy: hmm ok, did you try https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack for slack ?
Jul 15 20:14:09 <technomancy>	aveltras: yes, it didn't work very well when I tried it
Jul 15 20:53:22 <aveltras>	anyone using exwm on a daily basis ? is it smooth sailing ?
Jul 15 20:53:34 <kenrestivo>	i think technomancy does?
Jul 15 20:54:08 <aveltras>	found this https://mastodon.social/@amdt/99438677174378931 which would imply that it was the case at least in the past :p

Jul 15 21:05:31 <technomancy>	I don't understand that link at all
Jul 15 21:05:40 <technomancy>	why would you want two frames that are both emacs side-by-side
Jul 15 21:06:04 <shrysr>	is there some way to not enter your password and server and nickname every time I start up erc?
Jul 15 21:06:15 <technomancy>	,tell shrysr about authinfo.gpg
Jul 15 21:06:15 <fsbot>	shrysr: hmm, auth-sources are One approach is (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg"))
Jul 15 21:07:50 <shrysr>	technomancy: okay - I have that setup for my git repos. How do I add ERC's stuff ?
Jul 15 21:08:05 <technomancy>	hm; I thought the bot would know =)
Jul 15 21:08:31 <technomancy>	I did it once but it was a long time ago
Jul 15 21:08:49 <shrysr>	How do you do it now? ? 
Jul 15 21:09:55 <technomancy>	I just leave my erc running for 9-12 months at a time
Jul 15 21:10:04 <shrysr>	:D
Jul 15 21:10:31 <jaafar>	Meetup coming up this Wednesday in SF: https://www.meetup.com/Emacs-SF/events/262446850/
Jul 15 21:10:51 <shrysr>	The nick and server are specified in the config which I borrowed from sacha chua https://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html .. It still asks me everything.

Jul 15 21:14:33 <technomancy>	shrysr: erc is running on a server which I connect to over mosh from many computers
Jul 15 21:14:58 <shrysr>	so cool :D 
Jul 15 21:19:20 <technomancy>	the only downside is that you can't use RET to browse URLs
Jul 15 21:19:25 <technomancy>	so when URLs wrap across lines it's annoying
Jul 15 21:26:09 <dale>	Is there something like https://dedo.io or Soulver or Calca for Emacs?
Jul 15 21:26:22 <dale>	I started to write out what they do but I'm finding it hard to describe.
Jul 15 21:26:35 <dale>	I'm going to end up with a damnable org table with formulas, aren't I.
Jul 15 21:26:51 <quotemstr>	Is dired-do-query-replace broken for anyone else?
Jul 15 21:27:45 <quotemstr>	It just randomly stops reporting that it replaced zero matches
Jul 15 21:30:29 <parsnip>	rudybot: how many of your commits are titled "blah"
Jul 15 21:30:31 <rudybot>	parsnip: Huh?  I see a section titled `Code', right above the `References' section, but it's empty.
Jul 15 21:31:02 <cvandusen>	Truly bug-free code.
Jul 15 21:31:16 <parsnip>	doesn't work
Jul 15 21:31:26 <cvandusen>	#shipit 
Jul 15 21:31:52 <cvandusen>	the eula will cover it
Jul 15 21:32:18 <parsnip>	does the number of times i do C-x g l a C-x 1 without binding it to a key imply brain damage?
Jul 15 21:33:07 <parsnip>	what would i even bind that to
Jul 15 21:34:10 <parsnip>	hmm, M-x free-keys shows C-x L is unbound
Jul 15 21:34:32 <parsnip>	or i could use C-x M as a prefix
Jul 15 21:34:52 <parsnip>	try the former for now
Jul 15 21:35:33 <npostavs>	dale: maybe calc emebedded mode would be sort of similar
Jul 15 21:36:27 <shrysr>	parsnip: did not know about M-x free-keys :D
Jul 15 21:36:38 <parsnip>	:)
Jul 15 21:37:44 <quotemstr>	Huh
Jul 15 21:37:45 <quotemstr>	Me either
Jul 15 21:37:54 <greenline>	hold up. free-keys?
Jul 15 21:37:55 <dale>	npostavs: I think maybe yes, but I always struggle to understand how to use embedded mode.  For example, I'm not really aware of something that means "recompute everything".  Plus I don't always want to write TeX, but I guess I could probably configure delimiters for Markdown somehow.
Jul 15 21:37:59 <quotemstr>	Oh, it's not standard
Jul 15 21:38:02 <dale>	free-keys is a third-party library, non?
Jul 15 21:38:21 <greenline>	ya
Jul 15 21:38:42 <greenline>	C-M-~ is free!
Jul 15 21:38:58 <greenline>	need to consult an orthopedist and occupational therapist, however
Jul 15 21:39:37 <dale>	And don't forget to add function keys to free-keys-keys, unless you're on a MacBook Pro without function keys oh god shoot me
Jul 15 21:39:50 <dale>	Also, I think super isn't in free-keys-modifiers by default.
Jul 15 21:40:08 <greenline>	Super belongs to i3 for me
Jul 15 21:40:15 <greenline>	but good to know free-keys can get more free
Jul 15 21:42:29 <parsnip>	it weirds me out that q doesn't work in magit
Jul 15 21:42:44 <parsnip>	or M-x magit-status anyways
Jul 15 21:42:47 <parsnip>	you have to C-g
Jul 15 21:43:34 <shrysr>	q buries the buffer I guess.
Jul 15 21:44:29 <dale>	I mean, q does bury the buffer for me.  q no longer exits Magit's new popup modal thing, though.
Jul 15 21:46:32 <parsnip>	sweet:

Jul 15 21:48:20 <parsnip>	and `l l` is a keypress away
Jul 15 21:48:28 <parsnip>	as well as `SPC`, etc
Jul 15 21:59:28 <jlf>	it seems like `l l` is more than a keypress away :p
Jul 15 22:00:44 <parsnip>	😉
Jul 15 22:07:27 <belak>	Is it possible to make a macro (or anything really) which will set a number of variables and call an sexp? Like (with-colors (message background-color)) or something like that, where background color is defined by with-colors
Jul 15 22:08:57 <belak>	I've got a bunch of values in a plist and I'd like to export them as variables
Jul 15 22:11:45 <greenline>	parsnip wait you bound a key to a named function that is defined in the key binding? Or did you just expand to show us what it does?
Jul 15 22:12:19 <parsnip>	greenline: `defun` returns the symbol
Jul 15 22:13:32 <greenline>	huh.
Jul 15 22:13:37 <greenline>	I never thought of doing something like that.
Jul 15 22:13:42 <greenline>	me being... green
Jul 15 22:13:45 <parsnip>	i'm sure i stole it from somewhere
Jul 15 22:13:50 <greenline>	as is tradition
Jul 15 22:13:54 <parsnip>	heh
Jul 15 22:14:28 <aidalgol>	It's not stealing; it's repurposing.
Jul 15 22:21:16 <greenline>	currently reading up on funcall
Jul 15 22:24:44 <johnjay>	it calls a function
Jul 15 22:24:53 <johnjay>	what else do you need to know
Jul 15 22:24:54 *	greenline mind = blown ;-)
Jul 15 22:25:17 <greenline>	yeah, it just so happens that the last "lisp" I was looking at (hy) has function definitons return None
Jul 15 22:25:33 <greenline>	It also doesn't allow () at the top level because Python is immature ;-)
Jul 15 22:26:12 <jlf>	belak: so something like  (bind-plist-properties (a c) '(a 1 b 2 c 3) (list a c)) -> (1 3)  ?
Jul 15 22:26:39 <belak>	jlf: yeah, similar to that
Jul 15 22:27:25 <jlf>	(defmacro bind-plist-properties (prop-vars plist &rest body) "Bind each of PROP-VARS to its associated value in PLIST and execute BODY.

Each PROP may be a plain symbol or a string, but keyword symbols are disallowed.  In the case of property
Jul 15 22:27:25 <jlf>	names of type string, the corresponding plain symbol is bound, e.g. the value associated with a prop of \"name\" would be bound to 'name. \(fn (PROP...)

Jul 15 22:51:47 <parsnip>	now pasting an image from google, that's a long link
Jul 15 22:53:42 <shrysr>	is it possible to automatically shorten any link I paste within emacs? 
Jul 15 22:54:56 <e1f>	there was a bot that used to do that here
Jul 15 22:55:07 <e1f>	be he decided to quit
Jul 15 22:56:30 <technomancy>	around a hundred chars isn't bad. it's the 300+ ones that are annoying
Jul 15 22:56:55 <e1f>	for people using console emacs, 80 chars
Jul 15 22:57:16 <technomancy>	I'm using -nw
Jul 15 22:57:38 <technomancy>	I have to C-x 1 to follow it but I have winner-undo to bring it back so it's only a couple extra keystrokes
Jul 15 22:57:43 <enicar>	that depends on console lines length…
Jul 15 22:57:55 <fledermaus>	rudybot: you give up on shortening urls?
Jul 15 22:57:56 <rudybot>	fledermaus: does shortening URLs bring you happiness?
Jul 15 22:58:12 <shrysr>	I thought -nw meant console emacs ? 
Jul 15 22:58:43 <parsnip>	shrysr: right, in console emacs, i guess emacs can't handle the link for you
Jul 15 22:59:03 <parsnip>	you have to rely on the console detecting it, which it won't if emacs added a line break, etc
Jul 15 22:59:04 <technomancy>	"console" could be used specifically to mean the ctrl-alt-f1 type of console but it is usually used to mean -nw, yeah
Jul 15 23:04:52 <shrysr>	Okay
Jul 15 23:05:29 <parsnip>	if google presents the word "aardvark" when searching for "a", does it make bold all three "a"'s?
Jul 15 23:05:32 <shrysr>	An access token is required, but the url-shortener package seems a decent workaround.
Jul 15 23:06:35 <parsnip>	wait, now it only bolds one "a"
Jul 15 23:07:05 <parsnip>	i thought i was searchign recently and all matches were bold
Jul 15 23:07:17 <parsnip>	invert that
Jul 15 23:07:31 <parsnip>	ah, on mobile chrome, it bolds matches
Jul 15 23:08:53 <parsnip>	hmm, in the "guessing" part, it's inverted, but in the "search results", the matching part is bold. w/e
Jul 15 23:13:30 <belak>	Oof, this is super ugly but is there a better way to do this? https://github.com/belak/base16-emacs/blob/5e95e9ba3549aced37283bdfa4d74908937f0d30/base16-theme.el#L140-L145
Jul 15 23:18:43 <shrysr>	how often do you guys update all your packages? 
Jul 15 23:23:27 <technomancy>	never have, never will
Jul 15 23:40:33 <aidalgol>	shrysr: When I remember.
Jul 15 23:40:37 <aidalgol>	technomancy: You never git pull?
Jul 15 23:40:57 <technomancy>	aidalgol: I never update all packages
Jul 15 23:41:11 <technomancy>	over the past year I've updated two or three individually
Jul 15 23:41:28 <aidalgol>	Afraid of new changes breaking things?
Jul 15 23:41:41 <aidalgol>	It's not as if you're missing out on security fixes in anything but Emacs.
Jul 15 23:41:42 <technomancy>	just don't see the point
Jul 15 23:41:57 <aidalgol>	bug fixes?
Jul 15 23:42:32 <technomancy>	as far as I can tell, the packages I use don't have bugs in the areas of functionality I actually use
Jul 15 23:43:29 <technomancy>	the only exception is I know of one bug in magit when you kill the *magit-process* buffer, but I also know that the fixed version is worse than the version with the bug in it
Jul 15 23:43:39 <technomancy>	(and the manual workaround for the bug is easy)
Jul 15 23:44:43 <aidalgol>	Why haven't you rage-forked magit by now?
Jul 15 23:45:08 <technomancy>	eh no need to fork when the version I'm using is already perfect (other than the bug with an easy workaround)
Jul 15 23:46:12 <aidalgol>	I am genuinely amazed that you are not more into retrocomputing than you are.
Jul 15 23:47:04 <technomancy>	today I had someone say that I should rebuild the Atreus Deck around a RISC-V board and they'd sell like FLOSSnerd hotcakes
Jul 15 23:48:02 <kenrestivo>	isn't risc-v overkill for an atreus keyboard?
Jul 15 23:48:14 <kenrestivo>	it's an arduino, right?
Jul 15 23:48:33 <technomancy>	kenrestivo: not for the keyboard, for the cyberdeck
Jul 15 23:48:40 <kenrestivo>	oh, the android thing?
Jul 15 23:48:44 <technomancy>	https://atreus.technomancy.us/deck
Jul 15 23:48:56 <technomancy>	the current proof-of-concept is android but it's deeply unsatisfying
Jul 15 23:49:05 <kenrestivo>	does anyone even have android running on a risc-v board with all the accoutrements (wifi, bluetooth, baseband) yet?
Jul 15 23:49:36 <technomancy>	baseband like ... GSM?
Jul 15 23:49:41 <kenrestivo>	i guess it doesn't have to be a mobile os then
Jul 15 23:49:47 <kenrestivo>	yes GSM/LTE etc
Jul 15 23:49:48 <e1f>	we're not living in the future yet
Jul 15 23:49:49 <kenrestivo>	baseband
Jul 15 23:50:25 <technomancy>	I'd be happy with just wifi+usb+LVDS... I'd be ecstatic if it had a power management unit but I'm not holding my breath
Jul 15 23:51:24 <average>	is it common of train stations to host a number of hobos
Jul 15 23:51:42 <technomancy>	someone was saying that the one good thing about the trade war with china is that it's spurring serious development into alternatives to ARM
Jul 15 23:51:56 <technomancy>	since the US is bullying ARM into blockading China
Jul 15 23:52:12 <kenrestivo>	https://pulp-platform.github.io/ariane/docs/home/ nothing looks production ready yet
Jul 15 23:52:45 <kenrestivo>	in general the good thing about trade wars is it results in aggressive import substitution
Jul 15 23:54:40 <technomancy>	https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed
Jul 15 23:55:14 <technomancy>	oh shit it's us$999
Jul 15 23:55:43 <technomancy>	I guess I can wait a year or two
Jul 15 23:57:59 <technomancy>	haha this one has wifi by just slapping an esp32 on it wtf https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive1-rev-b
Jul 15 23:59:37 <e1f>	i can't concieve of the chinese making a serious arm alternative
Jul 16 00:00:07 <fledermaus>	e1f: riscv.
Jul 16 00:00:36 <e1f>	that's not chinese though
Jul 16 00:00:48 <e1f>	i meant original
Jul 16 00:00:55 <technomancy>	obligatory https://p.hagelb.org/risc.gif
Jul 16 00:01:10 <fledermaus>	e1f: well riscv is Freely licensed.
Jul 16 00:01:18 <e1f>	i wonder if the u.s. could block riscv export too
Jul 16 00:01:36 <kenrestivo>	the us tried to block export of an algorithm
Jul 16 00:01:43 <kenrestivo>	people put it on t-shirts
Jul 16 00:01:43 <e1f>	yeah
Jul 16 00:02:15 <e1f>	the u.s. could block chinese riscv products
Jul 16 00:02:22 <e1f>	"national security"
Jul 16 00:02:24 <kenrestivo>	lol http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/shirt/
Jul 16 00:04:44 <e1f>	chinese are blocking canadian canola and pork exports
Jul 16 00:05:13 <kenrestivo>	NO BACON FOR YOU!
Jul 16 00:05:19 <kenrestivo>	eh
Jul 16 00:05:36 <e1f>	canada is holding the daughter of huawei ceo on the request from the u.s.
Jul 16 00:06:17 <e1f>	this is how star wars started. a trade dispute that got out of hand
Jul 16 00:07:35 <technomancy>	isn't it against the geneva convention to punish a family member for something their parent did?
Jul 16 00:08:53 <e1f>	she is being held for selling the iranians stuff that was illegal to sell
Jul 16 00:09:30 <parsnip>	hmm, icon for using internal storage. just for debugging for now. guess i'll use a lock.
Jul 16 00:10:38 <technomancy>	ah ok; that's different
Jul 16 00:10:51 <e1f>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Wanzhou
Jul 16 00:12:20 <e1f>	also, the geneva convention applies at wartime; a trade war is not considered wartime
Jul 16 00:13:29 <e1f>	in retaliation, the chinese arrested two canadians as hostages; while meng is free on bail, they are imprisoned
Jul 16 00:14:13 <e1f>	last week, one of the canadians was denied the use of his reading glasses
Jul 16 00:14:55 <technomancy>	so much for my plan of pretending to be canadian to avoid the embarrassment of being associated with the US =\
Jul 16 00:15:01 <technomancy>	time to brush up on my NZ accent
Jul 16 00:16:07 <aidalgol>	technomancy: We're still a client state to both the US and China, despite what we'd like the world to believe.

Jul 16 00:24:37 <e1f>	all i know about nz is what the tourism board sells me about lotr
Jul 16 00:25:28 <aidalgol>	oh god, you reminded me of the upcoming LotR TV series.

Jul 16 00:35:24 <parsnip>	please forgive my use of "literally" there
Jul 16 00:36:13 <e1f>	the license is not gpl, no it can't be included
Jul 16 00:37:57 <e1f>	ed is our competition? wow. is emacs regressing? i thought vim was
Jul 16 00:38:25 <Twylo>	ed(1) is the standard editor
Jul 16 00:38:27 <e1f>	but it's not really anymore since you can have both now. simultaneously
Jul 16 00:38:53 <e1f>	Twylo: no one is disputing that
Jul 16 00:39:21 <Plazma>	E1f you work on emacs?
Jul 16 00:40:01 <e1f>	nope. i just did the splash image you see at startup
Jul 16 00:40:05 <Twylo>	(for reference: https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt )
Jul 16 00:40:47 <Plazma>	Oh fancy pants haha
Jul 16 00:40:52 <johnjay>	e1f: i see that splash screen everyday when i start emacs anew
Jul 16 00:41:54 <turbofail>	inhibiting that splash screen was like the first thing i put in my .emacs
Jul 16 00:42:06 <johnjay>	oh you can do that?
Jul 16 00:42:17 *	johnjay wonders off to edit his init.el
Jul 16 00:42:23 <turbofail>	,dv inhibit-startup-screen
Jul 16 00:42:23 <fsbot>	Non-nil inhibits the startup screen.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	This is for use in your personal init file (but NOT site-start.el),
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	once you are familiar with the contents of the startup screen.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	You can customize this variable.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	Defined in `/usr/share/emacs/24.5/lisp/startup.elc'.
Jul 16 00:42:45 <parsnip>	turbofail: but do you have this!
Jul 16 00:42:47 <aidalgol>	e1f: last I heard, yes
Jul 16 00:42:49 <e1f>	i was going to damn you with faint praise for doing that. now i'm just going to damn you
Jul 16 00:42:50 <parsnip>	(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "turbofail")
Jul 16 00:43:13 <johnjay>	it worked!
Jul 16 00:43:19 <parsnip>	my *Messages* buffer is empty on startup
Jul 16 00:43:24 <johnjay>	as they say, das AMAZIN
Jul 16 00:43:55 <e1f>	after all the grief i went through
Jul 16 00:44:09 <parsnip>	maybe unless all packages aren't installed
Jul 16 00:44:15 <johnjay>	i saw it like every day for a month though
Jul 16 00:44:19 <johnjay>	i think i did my fair share
Jul 16 00:44:34 <johnjay>	i think i even tried to edit it one time
Jul 16 00:44:45 <johnjay>	like add a picture or text or something
Jul 16 00:45:31 <johnjay>	ah it's 'startup.el'
Jul 16 00:46:25 <parsnip>	i remember discussing that with someone trying to do that here
Jul 16 00:46:44 <Twylo>	You can customize fancy-startup-screen or something, I think
Jul 16 00:46:45 <parsnip>	like, startup.el `insert`s an image or something
Jul 16 00:46:55 <parsnip>	ah
Jul 16 00:47:13 <turbofail>	i probably lied about it being the "first" thing but it was definitely close to it
Jul 16 00:47:46 <turbofail>	my version control on it doesn't go back far enough to really tell
Jul 16 00:49:40 <e1f>	yeah, you can replace it with your own image. i needed var that to be able to test new versions
Jul 16 00:50:29 <xtifr>	I don't suppress the splash--I just start in daemon mode, which doesn't bother to display it in the first place. :)

Oct 11 20:50:24 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Have you read the documentation? (info "(elisp) Advising Functions") and/or add-function doc string would be a good start.
Oct 11 20:55:38 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, yeah I've read it, but I don't exactly get how my own function should look like
Oct 11 20:59:50 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: As described in the add-function doc string, in case of :around advice, the first argument of the advice is the original function, followed by the original function's arguments. You do your thing and call the original function somewhere from inside the advice.
Oct 11 21:00:26 *	dale doesn't have a read-password function.
Oct 11 21:00:42 *	stepnem assumes read-passwd is meant
Oct 11 21:00:45 <dale>	Ah, yes.
Oct 11 21:01:07 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, thank you! I literally just now understand what that "(lambda....) stuff in the docu means
Oct 11 21:02:43 <dale>	Yosemitesam: Ex. (defun my-read-passwd-advice (orig-fun &rest args) (unwind-protect (progn (<change frame title here>) (apply orig-fun args)) (<change frame title back here>))) (advice-add 'read-passwd :around #'my-read-passwd-advice)
Oct 11 21:03:48 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: I think if you read the info manual it's quite clear, and with examples. The doc string is a bit terse, indeed. Just an overview.
Oct 11 21:05:20 <Yosemitesam>	dale, thanks a lot! I was almost there but still missing the "%rest" :D
Oct 11 21:05:50 <dale>	Yosemitesam: I hope you typed &rest not %rest in your code. :)
Oct 11 21:06:12 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, yeah, but I didn't find an example function in the info manual
Oct 11 21:06:18 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: In your case (orig-fun prompt &rest _args) might be more useful, as you'll need the prompt argument.
Oct 11 21:06:34 <Yosemitesam>	dale, uff... My typing is really bad today xD
Oct 11 21:07:00 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Really? The section I pointed to is full of examples.
Oct 11 21:07:02 <dale>	Yosemitesam: Oh, stepnem has good adv—er, a good tip there, I missed you were trying to look for a keyword in the password prompt.
Oct 11 21:08:02 <dale>	stepnem: (My personal convention is not to name it _args when I'm going to actually use it in the body of the function, even if just passing to apply in this case.)
Oct 11 21:08:49 <stepnem>	dale: Exactly, I was just typing that now... sorry for the confusion. Didn't realize you'll need the rest, too, anyway.
Oct 11 21:12:08 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Just to be completely clear in case you're actually gonna use it, the underscore shouldn't be there. It's useful to add it if you don't use the argument as a hint to Emacs byte compiler, but here it was a thinko on my part.
Oct 11 21:15:05 <Yosemitesam>	hmm okay.. Thank you guys!

Oct 11 21:38:47 <work_>	dale: 
Oct 11 21:38:47 <Yosemitesam>	dale, btw. thank you for the "unwind-protect" code! I finally got it working and this unwind-protect is really great to make it more cleanly :)
Oct 11 21:38:47 <dale>	Any CIDER users care to tell me if it really fails to complete a symbol until you've eval'ed it?  Ex. if I (def foo 'bar), but don't eval it, I don't get completion on "fo" from company-mode.
Oct 11 21:38:54 <dale>	Yosemitesam: NP
Oct 11 21:39:17 <bpalmer>	dale: defvar ?
Oct 11 21:39:25 <bpalmer>	or defalias?
Oct 11 21:39:32 <bpalmer>	or is def a new thing?
Oct 11 21:39:38 <work_>	dale: I have the NS port too (I think) but I can"t use special characters with it like ü ä ö ï as Option keys is meta key
Oct 11 21:39:56 <stepnem>	bpalmer: CIDER implies clojure I think
Oct 11 21:40:33 <dale>	bpalmer: Yup, Clojure.
Oct 11 21:40:35 <bpalmer>	Ah. I didn't know that.
Oct 11 21:40:59 <dale>	bpalmer: CIDER:Clojure::SLIME:Common Lisp.  (In my unexperienced opinion.)
Oct 11 21:41:54 <dale>	work_: Yes, AFAIK you either configure a macOS key to be an Emacs modifier, or IIRC you can set the corresponding Emacs var for the modifier key to nil and it will behave as it does in the rest of macOS.
Oct 11 21:43:16 <dale>	work_: Ex. I just set ns-right-option-modifier to nil (was 'left) and now I can do things like ⌥u u to type ü.
Oct 11 21:44:11 <dale>	work_: Note that Emacs does have at least a few ways to enter "special characters", try C-x 8 " u also enters ü, for example.  See also the TeX input method in Emacs, which seems somewhat popular.
Oct 11 21:44:43 <work_>	dale: that is exactly what I want so I can use right option as my good old AltGr key 
Oct 11 21:45:15 <dale>	work_: You know, I just did that with ns-right-option-modifier, and my left option key followed suit, which seems odd.  Check all your modifiers after setting.
Oct 11 21:47:24 <work_>	dale: but am currently using railwaycat/emacsmacport , not NS 😬
Oct 11 21:47:46 <dale>	work_: IIRC, it used to have a corresponding e.g. mac-right-option-modifier variable.
Oct 11 21:49:01 <work_>	dale: I feel like am learning Emacs all over again by switching to a MacBook Pro ... 
Oct 11 21:49:22 <dale>	work_: It's not too late, turn back.
Oct 11 21:50:22 <work_>	dale: ohh yeah... it is... My old Linux machine as too many problem lol
Oct 11 21:50:44 <work_>	dale: the machine itself, not Linux
Oct 11 21:51:15 <technomancy>	I thought macbook users just had all just given up and connected external keyboards at this point
Oct 11 21:51:37 <dale>	technomancy: Unpopular opinion: the 2019 MBP keyboard is nice.
Oct 11 21:51:47 <dale>	technomancy: *Note: statement does not include the Touch Bar which ruins the whole fucking thing.
Oct 11 21:52:11 <technomancy>	dale: that's the first positive thing I've ever heard said about it
Oct 11 21:52:40 <krux02>	I have the feeling that magit got much less usable since tha last time I updated
Oct 11 21:52:45 <dale>	technomancy: I have owned this for like four months and I have only had to take compressed air to it once!
Oct 11 21:53:04 <technomancy>	,faintpraise
Oct 11 21:53:04 <fsbot>	well...at least it's better than vimscript
Oct 11 21:53:07 <krux02>	it often takes more than 10 seconds for the magit status screen to appear.
Oct 11 21:53:22 <dale>	technomancy: I actually like the lower activation force, and the low travel doesn't bother me, as it turns out.  If you see me complaining about RSI here in a few more months, you can remind me of my words on this day.
Oct 11 21:53:58 <krux02>	When it is about RSI, I can feel it coming with me.
Oct 11 21:54:14 <krux02>	Not a problem yet, but it also doesn't feel like it is getting any better.
Oct 11 21:54:36 <krux02>	I guess the only way to hanle emacs and it's many modifiers will be pedals, like a real piano.
Oct 11 21:55:13 <krux02>	does anybody know good pedals that are not super ultra expensive?
Oct 11 21:55:53 <work_>	technomancy: am currently using the 2019 model and I like how flat the keyboard is. the low travel key...(like typing on a flat surface). I guess that's just me. 🤷‍♂️
Oct 11 21:56:28 <dale>	technomancy: See?  The tide is turning!
Oct 11 21:56:35 <technomancy>	wow, two in one month!
Oct 11 21:56:49 <dale>	technomancy: Now let me tell you about how I can't reboot my macOS machine cleanly, and how I can't search my email anymore, for some reason.
Oct 11 21:56:59 <work_>	dale: loving the Touch Bar sooo far😊
Oct 11 21:57:18 <dale>	work_: OK, that's too far.
Oct 11 21:57:19 <technomancy>	dale: I saw a screenshot that showed a mac refusing to run a program because it couldn't prove that it didn't contain malware
Oct 11 21:57:30 <technomancy>	I was like ... "buddy. I have some bad news for you about the halting problem"
Oct 11 21:57:52 <dale>	technomancy: I would find that very amusing, let me know if you run into it again.
Oct 11 21:58:17 <work_>	dale: did you face keyboard issue for the 2019 model for you to use  compressed air?
Oct 11 21:58:46 <technomancy>	dale: https://p.hagelb.org/malware.png
Oct 11 21:58:51 <dale>	Company had me install some DLP software or something on my Mac.  It installs itself to /Library/.rpc and takes up one core at all times because it gets stuck on xlsx files in a Go project's test data directory that I happen to have checked out.
Oct 11 21:58:59 <dale>	work_: Yes.
Oct 11 21:59:21 <dale>	technomancy: Oh, hm, that smells like the usual "not signed" (or maybe the new "not notarized") error.
Oct 11 21:59:37 <dale>	If I had an app bundle around with a broken signature I'd test it.
Oct 11 21:59:39 <technomancy>	dale: it's just hilarious that they think they can prove it doesn't have malware
Oct 11 21:59:43 <work_>	dale: Wow, am scared now... I though they were immune to keyboard issue so far...
Oct 11 21:59:44 <dale>	Oh, LibreOffice breaks itself every time it runs, let me try that.
Oct 11 22:00:05 <dale>	technomancy: I've never even noticed that, it is funny.  That prompt is kind of like "you want to use your computer blah blah blah press OK you know you're gonna".
Oct 11 22:00:14 <technomancy>	I mean, if they were going to block all programs containing malware, how come they still allow you to run itunes?
Oct 11 22:00:33 <dale>	technomancy: (iTunes has been removed from macOS latest release.)
Oct 11 22:00:42 <technomancy>	!!!
Oct 11 22:00:44 <technomancy>	awesome
Oct 11 22:01:44 <vvor>	krux02: Surly you ca do without the pedals http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/i/emacs_user_at_work_by_earlcolour.jpg
Oct 11 22:02:53 <didi>	I wouldn't mind more arms.
Oct 11 22:02:57 <technomancy>	wait, are you messing with me?
Oct 11 22:03:13 <dale>	technomancy: No?
Oct 11 22:03:27 <technomancy>	ah, ok, cool
Oct 11 22:03:42 <technomancy>	but they probably still allow chrome's EME malware to be installed, right?
Oct 11 22:03:50 <didi>	Sometimes I'm holding bags with both arms and I need to open the door.
Oct 11 22:04:02 <dale>	technomancy: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210200
Oct 11 22:04:54 <technomancy>	dale: oh, so they just rebranded it; there's still the same level of hostile DRM and debugger-suppression.
Oct 11 22:05:20 <didi>	Apple Books, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts... I see from where GNOME got the idea of their program's names.
Oct 11 22:05:32 <krux02>	technomancy: probably some malware is written using emacs
Oct 11 22:06:00 <krux02>	maybe some malware writer is here in the chat room asking for help and nobody knows it.
Oct 11 22:06:07 <technomancy>	krux02: the most widely-deployed scheme program is malware
Oct 11 22:06:12 <technomancy>	probably written in emacs
Oct 11 22:06:37 <krux02>	I didn.t know that scheme programs are deployed at all.
Oct 11 22:07:59 <bpalmer>	https://tyler.io/broken/ , as was linked to on hacker news a few days ago, was an interesting rant about catalina
Oct 11 22:08:45 <technomancy>	krux02: can't find the link but it was some 90s or early 2000s windows thing
Oct 11 22:09:14 <dale>	bpalmer: I just read that this morning, it does not make me feel happy at all.
Oct 11 22:09:29 <dale>	I live in constant fear that I will accidentally accept the Catalina "software update".
Oct 11 22:11:13 <siloxid>	dale: why, is there something bad about the update?
Oct 11 22:11:23 <bremner>	dale: there's always ,,twb-fix,,
Oct 11 22:11:23 <fsbot>	Most problems can be solved by installing Debian.
Oct 11 22:11:36 <siloxid>	,proq-fix
Oct 11 22:11:36 <fsbot>	I heard proq-fix is [0] most gui problems can be fixed by installing ratpoison
Oct 11 22:11:37 <fsbot>	[1] some speed problems too
Oct 11 22:11:43 <jlf>	,jlf-fix
Oct 11 22:11:43 <fsbot>	Most problems can be solved with a Hendrick's martini
Oct 11 22:11:54 <dale>	siloxid: 1. It ends in .0.
Oct 11 22:12:01 <dale>	siloxid: 2. See above article for scary.
Oct 11 22:12:21 <siloxid>	dale: so just the usual bleeding edge wariness
Oct 11 22:12:32 <dale>	bremner: I don't recall if they even figured out how to boot Linux on a 2019 MBP.
Oct 11 22:12:37 <bremner>	heh.
Oct 11 22:12:41 <bremner>	well, you got me there
Oct 11 22:12:58 <technomancy>	obligatory https://p.hagelb.org/update.jpg
Oct 11 22:12:59 <dale>	siloxid: I suppose so.  Someone posted a link to a Gist here the other day where people are trying to figure out how to give Emacs the permission it needs to edit... files.
Oct 11 22:13:23 <siloxid>	dale: huh. does the built-in emacs have the same issue?
Oct 11 22:13:26 <didi>	technomancy: Nice.
Oct 11 22:13:43 <dale>	siloxid: There is no more built-in Emacs with macOS, I've heard.
Oct 11 22:13:50 <siloxid>	ewww
Oct 11 22:14:53 <bpalmer>	rudybot: fix these folks a nice martini
Oct 11 22:14:54 <rudybot>	bpalmer: let's pursue our quest for the perfect martini
Oct 11 22:15:33 <siloxid>	wow, good thing I was in here. I've been hoping to upgrade all of last week
Oct 11 22:15:46 <mns>	dale: there is a built-in emacs in macOS, its just stuck at version 22.  
Oct 11 22:15:59 <bpalmer>	mns: is that the case for the new macOS, catalina?
Oct 11 22:16:20 <bpalmer>	10.15, I guess
Oct 11 22:16:41 <mns>	bpalmer: I've not upgraded to catalina yet.  I still have to get to mojave.  I'm on 10.13
Oct 11 22:18:38 <krux02>	you can always install Linux on a mac book. This will provide you with up to date OpenGL drivers.
Oct 11 22:19:38 <dale>	mns: They supposedly removed it from Catalina.
Oct 11 22:20:03 <mns>	bpalmer: so just verified via folks in osx channel.  emacs 22.1.1 has been removed from macOS catalina
Oct 11 22:21:00 <mns>	dale:  yes you are correct.  not that I used it much anyway.  I had emacs installed via brew.
Oct 11 22:21:34 <bpalmer>	that's a shame. 22 was a decent vintage.
Oct 11 22:21:35 <dale>	OK, smells like you can boot Linux on a MBP with a T2 chip if you disable secure boot.
Oct 11 22:28:12 <siloxid>	seems odd to me that you would pay all that money for a MBP just to run linux on it when you have such amazing ASUS laptops out there
Oct 11 22:28:29 <siloxid>	but to each their own, and apple did make an amazing laptop in 2013
Oct 11 22:28:43 <technomancy>	also the aluminum G4 was pretty good
Oct 11 22:29:46 <bpalmer>	the macbook air from around that timeframe was great.
Oct 11 22:31:31 <dale>	siloxid: I agree.
Oct 11 23:03:25 <foggyboi>	just upgraded to catalina and I can save stuff in emacs still so… not too scary lol
Oct 11 23:14:07 <didi>	,channel-wisdom
Oct 11 23:14:07 <fsbot>	The SPC key and the ~/.spacemacs completely replaced my need to know anything about emacs.
Oct 11 23:14:34 <didi>	,doom-emacs
Oct 11 23:14:35 <fsbot>	hmm, Doom is [0] at https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs

Oct 11 23:16:07 <bpalmer>	rudybot: you have brought doom upon us all
Oct 11 23:16:09 <rudybot>	bpalmer: or perhaps brought on by the doom theme I'm using (doom-vibrant)
Oct 11 23:17:15 <didi>	Let's implement a 2.5 D tab.

Oct 11 23:24:10 <dale>	foggyboi: Curious if you have SIP on?  And have you tried saving under, say, ~/Documents?
Oct 11 23:24:39 <dale>	dto: That looks really nice.
Oct 11 23:24:52 <dto>	dale: thanks :) it's getting there. 
Oct 11 23:25:13 <dto>	it doesn't entirely work yet. the left most voice works but not polyphony (yet)
Oct 11 23:55:04 <Allos>	Hi, how do I get org-class to show a specific time range on the agenda?
Oct 11 23:56:23 <foggyboi>	dale uhhhh let's see lol
Oct 11 23:56:50 <dale>	foggyboi: If you don't know you've turned it off, which requires booting into recovery and running some commands, then you should have it on.  It's not terribly easy to turn off.
Oct 11 23:56:54 <foggyboi>	dale hahaha yeah not permitted but I probably just need to enable /usr/bin/ruby since I think I'm using that launcher
Oct 11 23:57:12 <dale>	foggyboi: Oh, you mean writing to that dir, gotcha.
Oct 11 23:57:25 <foggyboi>	yeah i'm not having problems saving generally
Oct 11 23:57:34 <foggyboi>	adium isn't auto scrolling tho so I might throw my laptop hahaha
Oct 12 00:04:52 <didi>	So apparently "reaction video" is a popular genre on youtube. Every music search comes with tons of them.
Oct 12 00:05:51 <bpalmer>	might depend on the music you're searching for
Oct 12 00:06:06 <didi>	I guess.
Oct 12 00:06:16 <bpalmer>	but yeah. Sometimes I even enjoy watching reaction videos
Oct 12 00:08:38 <didi>	I like to explore covers.
Oct 12 00:12:29 <bpalmer>	rudybot: nothing's better than curling up under the covers on a cold winter day and reading your TAOCP
Oct 12 00:12:40 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Must be one of those Canadian winter sports -- doughnut curling
Oct 12 00:13:15 <didi>	Have you actually read TAOCP? I tried. Head still hurts.
Oct 12 00:17:14 <bpalmer>	I have read parts. 
Oct 12 00:18:41 <didi>	I couldn't go moar than a few pages.
Oct 12 00:30:33 <turbofail>	yay my sound works again
Oct 12 00:31:19 <didi>	*pulseaudio flashback*
Oct 12 00:31:30 <turbofail>	can't blame this one on pulseaudio, the damn thing wasn't even showing up in lspci for a while
Oct 12 00:31:46 <turbofail>	a kernel update fixed it

Oct 12 12:33:18 <roadie>	oh I could run a macro that kills the region, enters the tag, yanks the killed region, enters the end tag and done - too easy
Oct 12 12:46:01 <afidegnum>	hello, what best utility to visualize diagrams in emacs? CEDET seems old
Oct 12 12:48:58 <bremner>	I guess you can just get your favorite tool to generate svg or pdf and view that?
Oct 12 12:49:54 <afidegnum>	i m also having another issue with svg
Oct 12 12:50:19 <afidegnum>	svg can't be clicked/interracted 
Oct 12 12:50:39 <bremner>	I can recommend inkscape
Oct 12 12:56:28 <afidegnum>	is there an inkscape plugin for emacs?
Oct 12 13:00:07 <bremner>	not that I'm aware of
Oct 12 13:01:31 <afidegnum>	i m stucked to visualizing diagram and interracting with diagrams in emacs
Oct 12 13:01:55 <afidegnum>	i came accross plantuml but the svg output can't be modified
Oct 12 13:02:43 <bremner>	yeah, it's like most textual diagram generators in that sense
Oct 12 13:02:51 <bremner>	I guess dot is the rare exception
Oct 12 13:03:09 <bremner>	plantml seems decent, if you must work with UML
Oct 12 13:03:12 <str1ngs>	I've used org-brain for this sorta thing. but I guess that's if you generate the images
Oct 12 13:03:18 <bremner>	err, plantuml
Oct 12 13:03:56 <bremner>	afidegnum: you can't interactively modify the pdf output from latex either, at least not in emacs
Oct 12 13:04:11 <afidegnum>	then i have to look for another methods interracting with teh daigram, 
Oct 12 13:04:13 <bremner>	people still seem to find it useful
Oct 12 13:04:35 <afidegnum>	maybe via cli or editing the generated file.... 
Oct 12 13:05:07 <str1ngs>	I wrote a cli tool named via :P
Oct 12 13:05:20 <afidegnum>	i have also come accross artist mode... but way far from what i need
Oct 12 13:05:32 <afidegnum>	str1ngs: url ?
Oct 12 13:05:59 <str1ngs>	via-android/
Oct 12 13:06:06 <str1ngs>	https://github.com/mrosset/via
Oct 12 13:06:06 <afidegnum>	ah ok
Oct 12 13:06:36 <str1ngs>	last link is more appropriate. it's kinda offtopic to your issue though 
Oct 12 13:06:41 <bremner>	afidegnum: I think it's fair to say interactive graphics is not really emacs's strength
Oct 12 13:07:14 <bremner>	people do fun things as demos, but it's very much the bear on the bicyle
Oct 12 13:07:17 <str1ngs>	with org-brain I just had it export on write. so kinda interactive I guess
Oct 12 13:07:20 <bremner>	bicycle
Oct 12 13:07:42 <bremner>	str1ngs: I was thinking of click and drag graphics elements
Oct 12 13:08:09 <bremner>	rudybot: it's not that bear is good at riding the bicycle
Oct 12 13:08:13 <str1ngs>	there is that. but I did'nt want to assume that's the workflow he means
Oct 12 13:08:29 <afidegnum>	we need to add some interractive graphics in emacs to make it complete, there is a need for that
Oct 12 13:08:38 <rudybot>	bremner: the thing about a bear riding a bicycle is not that it rides well...
Oct 12 13:09:09 <bremner>	afidegnum: or we could just use other tools for those tasks. It's not like core emacs is overflowing with contributors.
Oct 12 13:09:22 <bremner>	and there something like 30k open bugs
Oct 12 13:09:48 <str1ngs>	one bug for every year of emacs existence :P
Oct 12 13:09:49 <afidegnum>	ah, bad :)
Oct 12 13:28:19 <afidegnum>	bremner: i m getting something up
Oct 12 13:28:32 <afidegnum>	how to integrate gtk or qt into emacs?
Oct 12 13:28:47 <afidegnum>	or any similar graphic engine
Oct 12 13:28:56 <bremner>	how about "why" before "how"?
Oct 12 13:29:36 <afidegnum>	so i can do the graphical interractions on them..... 
Oct 12 13:36:17 <afidegnum>	isn't emacs built in gtk+ ?
Oct 12 13:36:33 <bremner>	sortof
Oct 12 13:36:54 <afidegnum>	so we can use some gtk libraries in emacs, right ?
Oct 12 13:36:57 <bremner>	it doesn't use gtk "cleanly" afaiu
Oct 12 13:37:05 <afidegnum>	oh
Oct 12 13:37:07 <bremner>	emacs is also buildable without gtk
Oct 12 13:37:47 <afidegnum>	ok
Oct 12 13:38:04 <afidegnum>	i just want to have an additional buffer in gtk or any other graphic engine
Oct 12 14:13:28 <str1ngs>	in nomad the extensible web browser a gtk buffer is a thing :)
Oct 12 14:15:15 <str1ngs>	and probably using cairo could be interactive
Oct 12 14:30:46 <afidegnum>	str1ngs: cairo? isn't that python?
Oct 12 14:35:09 <str1ngs>	cairo is gtk's vector graphics library
Oct 12 14:35:35 <str1ngs>	probably though clutter would be better to use. since it would have event and inputs
Oct 12 14:36:49 <str1ngs>	in nomad svg is supported by default. but as a webview. webview's in nomad are first order buffers
Oct 12 14:37:14 <str1ngs>	nomad is an extensible web browser. modeled like emacs
Oct 12 14:38:33 <afidegnum>	thanks for the enlightenment, let me add more cofee... and energy drinks:)
Oct 12 14:40:25 <str1ngs>	alternatively maybe an emacs module that used GTK to display a GTK window, which you could manipulate with emacs. but last I played with emacs modules and gtk. it was a bitch due to threading
Oct 12 14:40:38 <str1ngs>	and some GTK people yelled at me for the attempt :P
Oct 12 14:41:00 <str1ngs>	s/bitch/PITA/
Oct 12 14:41:32 <str1ngs>	and so I created nomad instead
Oct 12 14:42:51 <str1ngs>	what would be even better. is gobject introspetion binding for emacs
Oct 12 14:43:46 <afidegnum>	 ah, congrats... let me volupteously study it explore it
Oct 12 14:43:50 <str1ngs>	then you could write whole GTK programs in elisp :)
Oct 12 14:44:08 <str1ngs>	afidegnum: it's still pretty experimental
Oct 12 14:44:51 <afidegnum>	dsl?
Oct 12 14:44:52 <fsbot>	From memory, DSL is [0] domain-specific language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language> ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 12 14:45:03 <str1ngs>	right now I'm porting nomad to g-golf which is very early work. g-golf is guile bindings for gobject instrospection. nomad uses guile for it's extension language
Oct 12 14:46:58 <afidegnum>	well, let me dip my head, i believe i m closer to what i m looking for
Oct 12 14:48:22 <str1ngs>	http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/nomad/ has an alpha release
Oct 12 14:49:08 <str1ngs>	but the feature-g-golf http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/nomad.git/log/?h=feature-g-golf. has much better GTK support
Oct 12 14:49:32 <afidegnum>	no github?
Oct 12 14:50:25 <str1ngs>	I have a github mirror yes
Oct 12 14:50:40 <afidegnum>	i would like to explore the source code
Oct 12 14:50:53 <str1ngs>	http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/nomad.git/tree/scheme/nomad/webview.scm?h=feature-g-golf#n64
Oct 12 14:51:33 <afidegnum>	good
Oct 12 14:51:43 <str1ngs>	here is an example of a gtk widget as a first order buffer. https://github.com/mrosset/nomad/blob/feature-g-golf/scheme/nomad/webview.scm#L64
Oct 12 14:52:08 <str1ngs>	also https://github.com/mrosset/nomad/blob/feature-g-golf/scheme/nomad/text.scm#L44
Oct 12 14:52:34 <str1ngs>	and as a caveat. this is all still highly WIP
Oct 12 14:52:44 <afidegnum>	so mostly webview ?
Oct 12 14:53:55 <str1ngs>	well nomad is a web browser first, so webviews are the most mature. though text-buffer use gtksourceview's and are surprisingly use able with emacs bindings etc
Oct 12 14:54:22 <afidegnum>	ok, let me loook into it, 
Oct 12 14:54:53 <str1ngs>	I use something called emacsy which is guile library for creating emacs like programs
Oct 12 14:55:52 <str1ngs>	also there is #nomad-browser if you need support
Oct 12 14:56:39 <afidegnum>	good
Oct 12 14:57:05 <afidegnum>	i remember of guile, when i was reading scheme... but didn't pay attention much
Oct 12 15:08:11 <hodapp>	rudybot: I thought that eating cold fried fish was just a strange, gross Jewish tradition but I have to admit that cold whitefish with horseradish on toast is actually quite good.
Oct 12 15:08:28 <rudybot>	hodapp: gets a bagel with whitefish
Oct 12 15:10:58 <afidegnum>	seen wasamasa ?
Oct 12 15:11:32 <afidegnum>	he also did something on graphics on emacs i can remember
Oct 12 15:20:22 <bremner>	afidegnum: his was exactly the bear on a bicycle demo I was thinking of
Oct 12 15:20:34 <afidegnum>	:)
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	I have a certain workflow and it provokes certain problems. They are certainly newbie problems for my lack of the basic knowledge needed to solve them. I will describe one of my workflows and problems related to it below.
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	Everyday I start Emacs on Gnome by way of Super and then type: em <RET> .
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	Then: M-x erc-tl <TAB> <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	After that: <RET> <RET> <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:30 <quiliro>	Then my password and <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:33 <quiliro>	So the chatrooms are openned automatically...the ones that were open the previous night before closing Emacs, when I typed C-c C-x on the IRC server buffer.
Oct 12 15:22:41 <quiliro>	Sorry for the long message
Oct 12 15:23:24 <dzho>	cool story so far
Oct 12 15:25:01 <quiliro>	One of my problems it that the rooms are not the ones I defined to be open on the custumization of ERC, but the ones I had open when closing IRC connection.
Oct 12 15:25:10 <bremner>	does anyone know if the width of org-mode text export is configurable?
Oct 12 15:25:28 <bremner>	I want paragraphs without hard line breaks in org text export
Oct 12 15:25:38 <bremner>	because idiotic web systems
Oct 12 15:26:13 <quiliro>	The other problem with ERC is that I would want this process to be done automatically.
Oct 12 15:27:48 <bremner>	https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34901/orgmode-exporting-to-text-without-wrapping looks like an answer, let me try it out
Oct 12 15:27:51 <roadie>	can I append more than one defun to a mode add-hook? or do I type a line for each?
Oct 12 15:27:51 <quiliro>	And the last problem with ERC is that several versions of log files will create for each chatroom, if I reconnect without closing all chatrooms and IRC buffer.
Oct 12 15:29:30 <bremner>	,df add-hook
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	add-hook is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	(add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND LOCAL)
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	FUNCTION is not added if already present. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 12 15:29:39 <bremner>	one at a time, it loks like
Oct 12 15:36:47 <bandali>	hey bremner, how’s it going?
Oct 12 15:37:23 <bremner>	bandali: a bit better. You want to try to chat at some point today about emacsconf?
Oct 12 15:37:51 <bandali>	bremner, :) your deadline was yesterday, yeah? hopefully you’ve recovered some
Oct 12 15:38:09 <bandali>	and sure, that’d be nice. feel free to ping me in #emacsconf whenever you feel like it
Oct 12 15:40:13 <roadie>	thanks bremner 
Oct 12 15:41:55 <afidegnum>	is cairo in emacs 26 enabled by default or i need to compile emacs with it ?

Oct 13 19:29:20 <afidegnum>	hello, anyone successfully installed plantuml and emacs? i m confused about the installation, i need a hand. 
Oct 13 19:30:57 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: all I did was place the jar into my path
Oct 13 19:31:50 <wasamasa>	just don't place the jar into your mouth
Oct 13 19:31:51 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: then I added it to org-babel-load-languages and (setq org-plantuml-jar-path
Oct 13 19:31:54 <C-Keen>	      (expand-file-name "~/bin/plantuml.jar"))
Oct 13 19:36:10 <afidegnum>	C-Keen: $PATH ?
Oct 13 19:41:42 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: ~/bin/ is in my $PATH but it seems that for org-mode I needed to specify its location explicitly. IDK why I did that
Oct 13 19:46:07 <johnjay>	is clojure basically a lisp machine built on top of the JRE instead of i386?
Oct 13 19:46:38 <johnjay>	ever since wasa mentioned how CCL isn't turing complete i've been thinking of everythin as a Virtual Machine
Oct 13 19:50:19 <technomancy>	johnjay: no, lisp machines are big into self-hosting which the JVM is entirely uninterested in
Oct 13 19:51:38 <hodapp>	running the JVM inside the JVM would seem a bit silly
Oct 13 20:12:22 <johnjay>	self-hosting just means a compiler can compile itself right?
Oct 13 20:12:31 <johnjay>	emacs is lisp on top of C so idk it fits that definition
Oct 13 20:12:42 <wasamasa>	it doesn't
Oct 13 20:13:15 <wasamasa>	the byte-code compiler cannot spit out an extensible text editor
Oct 13 20:20:32 <wasamasa>	well, perhaps you could argue that specific thing is
Oct 13 20:21:16 <wasamasa>	if you are using a scheme compiler written in its own language to generate a new version of that compiler, the same thing can be said about the byte-code compiler
Oct 13 20:21:33 <wasamasa>	it's written in elisp, compiles elisp and can be used to compile more elisp
Oct 13 20:30:39 <johnjay>	i was thinking you could define a lisp machine on anything in that case
Oct 13 20:30:44 <lampilelo>	hello
Oct 13 20:30:48 <johnjay>	a .net lisp machine. an arm lisp machine

Oct 18 15:49:49 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Oct 18 15:51:30 <Abbott>	I want pasted c code into a c minor mode buffer to use tabs for indentation instead of 2 spaces. which option is that?
Oct 18 15:52:29 <Abbott>	I found this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentingC#toc5
Oct 18 15:52:30 <dale>	Abbott: If the code you pasted doesn't use tabs, select the pasted code (you may be able to just hit C-x C-x) and then Probably C-M-\ to reindent.  You may need M-x tabify RET instead.
Oct 18 15:54:45 <Abbott>	dale: the code I copy does have tabs in it, but when I paste it converts everything to 2 space indentation
Oct 18 15:54:52 <Abbott>	I'll try what you just suggested
Oct 18 15:54:59 <dale>	Abbott: Huh, that seems really odd.
Oct 18 15:55:37 <dale>	Abbott: Wait, is your c-mode indentation already set up for tabs, I mean for code you just type in and such?
Oct 18 15:55:47 <Abbott>	no
Oct 18 15:56:04 <dale>	Oh.  Then you want C code, period, to indent with tabs, including C code that you might paste.
Oct 18 15:56:22 <Abbott>	right, sorry
Oct 18 15:56:45 <Abbott>	question came out kind of clunky
Oct 18 15:57:45 <dale>	Abbott: NP.  Try setting indent-tabs-mode to non-nil in c-mode.  You may also need to set tab-width to something other than the default 8.
Oct 18 15:58:30 <dale>	Abbott: cc-mode (which includes c-mode and other modes for "C-like" languages) indentation is more configurable than many other Emacs modes.  Full documentation starts around https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ccmode.html#Indentation-Engine-Basics I believe.
Oct 18 15:58:37 <trafaret1>	bandali: big thanks  this is standart binding for erc :) 
Oct 18 15:59:25 <trafaret1>	bandali: C-c C-b :)
Oct 18 15:59:26 <bandali>	trafaret1, cheers :)
Oct 18 15:59:37 <dale>	Abbott: I'm struggling to remember the high points of cc-mode indentation, as I don't use it as often as I'd like.  I think c-basic-offset will be important, you'll probably want this to equal tab-width (change tab-width to equal c-basic-offset or vice versa).
Oct 18 16:00:39 <bandali>	trafaret1, indeed, C-c C-b is bound in erc, but not outside :) so i just bind it (though to a different binding) globally as well
Oct 18 16:00:54 <bandali>	the M-a was inspired by weechat’s
Oct 18 16:00:56 <dale>	Abbott: See also variables c-default-style and c-style-alist.  Both mentioned in above documentation.  But something like (setq indent-tabs-mode t tab-width 4 c-basic-offset 4) in a mode hook should at least get you started.
Oct 18 16:02:18 <Abbott>	okay, thank you very much for all this
Oct 18 16:02:32 <Abbott>	I'll thumb through this and see if I can get some configs properly set up

Oct 18 16:11:24 <bandali>	trafaret1, hmm, possibly? i’m personally not aware of any
Oct 18 16:11:35 <bandali>	actually, there’s bitlbee

Oct 18 16:12:36 <trafaret1>	bandali: ok, I know about bitlbee but I don't want to send my personal data from other client to 3 side 
Oct 18 16:16:01 <olivuser>	hello emacs.
Oct 18 16:16:36 <olivuser>	I would like to define custom types for org-agenda-custom-command. is that possible? I am curious, because the docstring seems to suggest it is, yet with arbitrary type naming I seem to not be successful
Oct 18 16:17:14 <cnx>	sorry for interupting, how do i have different styles for C (linux) and C++ (GNU)
Oct 18 16:17:35 <cnx>	currently i have (setq c-default-style "linux") in my config
Oct 18 16:22:53 <TreyHarris>	So I just was looking at the Ediff manual for something, and it's one of those annoying Emacs manuals that list only keybinds and not function names (so, if you have rebinding, you don't know what it's talking about). And the keys it suggests for the things I want to do aren't doing anything for me. The weird things, though, are that a) searching my configs, I don't have anything named `.*ediff.*` rebound, so
Oct 18 16:22:55 <TreyHarris>	I don't know why those default keys wouldn't work, and b) since Ediff has its own buffer with its own keymap that uses mostly unchorded commands, why is a key that the manual says should do something, like `@` or `*`, unbound (not bound to self-insert)?
Oct 18 16:23:31 <TreyHarris>	olivuser: see https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html
Oct 18 16:24:45 <cnx>	oops i found it in the manual, just use hooks is enough
Oct 18 16:25:08 <shrysr>	How can i understand/get started using ctags/etags (??) in my emacs workflow? I predominantly work with R/python and org files tangled to scripts (where necessary)... 
Oct 18 16:26:10 <cnx>	wait i need not, c-defaut-style support per-file
Oct 18 16:26:12 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: And oldie but a goodie: http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-use-ctags-in-emacs-effectively-3.html
Oct 18 16:26:55 <bandali>	trafaret1, right; then i’m not sure
Oct 18 16:28:13 <_thelion_>	Nevermind: I was able to solve it on my own ;)
Oct 18 16:29:09 <olivuser>	TreyHarris, thanks, but I am wondering specifically how to write a user-defined function (other than agenda, alltodo, todo etc), a possibility talked about in 3) of custom command configuration
Oct 18 16:29:14 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: ty that is helpful. i was also wondering - how are the tags more useful than a full text search ?
Oct 18 16:30:49 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: more useful? They aren't, on their own. But they're much faster.
Oct 18 16:31:18 <TreyHarris>	Well, technically they can support metadata like cross-references, but few actually do that
Oct 18 16:32:10 <TreyHarris>	If your files are cached in memory or on a fast SSD, if the fileset's small enough, it probably doesn't matter, though the tags commands are designed to be more quick-access
Oct 18 16:32:59 <TreyHarris>	olivuser:I see. I don't know, you might try on #org-mode (but be aware that replies there often take a few hours)
Oct 18 16:35:19 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: I believe all the IDE-like packages that let you jump between calls and definitions and inclusions and libraries, etc., work via tags or some proprietary (in the non-anti-open-source sense) caching mechanism, though some may fall back to plaintext searching project files on disk?
Oct 18 16:36:36 <sachac>	olivuser: You've probably come across https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8wohqz/completely_custom_orgagenda_with_support_for_gtd/ already, right?
Oct 18 16:39:05 <olivuser>	sachac, no I havent, thanks a bunch :)
Oct 18 16:39:50 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: hmm , i'm not sure about other IDE's, as Rstudio is the only one that i use very occassionally..kindda never look at anything other emacs sinec some years. THe issue for me with org mode so far was the jumping is between headlines and not functions variables, unless I C-c ' on a source block 
Oct 18 16:40:25 <olivuser>	also sorry for my "tone", didnt mean to be rude, dear fellows
Oct 18 16:40:52 <shrysr>	sachac: hello! your posts inspired me to get into emacs years ago.

Oct 18 16:44:34 <JordiGH>	bbuccianti: For what?
Oct 18 16:44:53 <bbuccianti>	for being graced with my presence
Oct 18 16:44:53 <JordiGH>	Now, who wants to talk rms drama?
Oct 18 16:44:56 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: the problem I face nowadays seems to be a balance betwee 'literate programming' and directly writing scripts with comments ... as both functions and projects get longer, its started becoming an issue. I think i inserted a tag within a source block by mistake some days ago and have been trying to find out more since then. i'm trying to figure out an easier way.  
Oct 18 16:45:02 <sachac>	JordiGH: Hah, I'm procrastinating working on my presentation for EmacsConf. Every so often, I get the "Aaaah! I don't know what I'm talking about!" imposter thing. =)

Oct 18 16:45:59 <sachac>	olivuser: There's a link to some implementation code there that looks pretty neat. =) I hope that helps you dig into the details of making your own agenda command. The example makes me want to write something like that too!
Oct 18 16:46:30 <bbuccianti>	I think JordiGH wants to appear on one of you interviews sachac
Oct 18 16:46:52 <JordiGH>	No drama? Anyone?
Oct 18 16:46:57 <JordiGH>	Fine.
Oct 18 16:47:02 <sachac>	bbuccianti: I should've done one when he visited!
Oct 18 16:47:30 <sachac>	Oh well. I'll probably be able to start them up again next year, when the kiddo starts going to school.
Oct 18 16:48:53 <bbuccianti>	sachac: interviews are coming back next year?
Oct 18 16:48:58 <bbuccianti>	awesome!
Oct 18 16:48:58 <olivuser>	sachac, to be honest it kinda made me freak out, since I'm quite new to elisp and to programming in general. What you did was show me there's some way to go and that I have to find a solution in the meantime (also a good thing^^)
Oct 18 16:49:14 <bandali>	wasamasa, you around?
Oct 18 16:49:52 <sachac>	olivuser: Mmm... Could you tell me more about the custom agendas you'd like to make? You might be able to get away with the built-in types, especially with some clever skipping.
Oct 18 16:50:17 <JordiGH>	Goign to school already? Geez, time flies.
Oct 18 16:51:01 <olivuser>	sachac, well, for me it is mainly about the block separators. I want to have about four block separators, and that proves to be kind of impossible if I dont define new types and/or rethink the way I want the different entries to be sorted
Oct 18 16:51:42 <olivuser>	essentially, I want: "Appointments" | "Now" and "Today" | "Tomorrow" | "Later" | "Some day"
Oct 18 16:52:56 <shrysr>	doesnt org-super-agenda help do this ^
Oct 18 17:01:06 <wasamasa>	bandali: just got off from work
Oct 18 17:01:46 <bandali>	wasamasa, ha :)
Oct 18 17:01:49 <bandali>	please pin my latest /r/emacs ann whenever you get a chance
Oct 18 17:01:59 <olivuser>	shrysr, for me, it doesnt. I already use org-super-agenda, but I have been unable to get it to work.

Oct 19 21:57:46 <RatS_Rule>	my question is how to format with two variables like in the first pastebin 'cause when i try like this (format qubes-copy file) it ends with "not enought argument"
Oct 19 21:58:26 <RatS_Rule>	*qvm-copy needs ...
Oct 19 21:59:17 <dale>	RatS_Rule: (format qubes-copy-to-vm arg1 arg2)
Oct 19 22:00:12 <dale>	RatS_Rule: In general, first arg to format is the format string, and each %s in the format string (or other % formatting, see docs) needs one argument following that first arg.  It's like printf, if you know C.
Oct 19 22:09:06 <RatS_Rule>	ok i stills end with errors when i try to use variables like this https://pastebin.com/raw/zVj5F7LR
Oct 19 22:13:25 <dale>	RatS_Rule: Does that *exact* code yield an error?  If yes, can you tell me what the error is?  If no, can you post the exact code that does give you an error, and also what that error is?
Oct 19 22:14:20 <RatS_Rule>	this do an error : not enought arguments 
Oct 19 22:16:02 <RatS_Rule>	when i put file in ( ) it's a symbol's function definition : void
Oct 19 22:17:01 <dale>	RatS_Rule: The exact code in your last URL works without error for me.  Are you sure the "not enough arguments" error is coming from Emacs and not from qvm-copy?  (I created a dummy shell script to stand in for qvm-copy, which I do not have.)
Oct 19 22:17:06 *	parsnip throws the rubber duck in a random direction.
Oct 19 22:17:51 *	dale calls PETRA.
Oct 19 22:19:56 <RatS_Rule>	the exact error is "not enought arguments for format string" so i except it comes from emacs; also the second pastebin works well; also i double check for C-x C-e defun and defvar ...
Oct 19 22:22:31 *	parsnip shouts, "it wasn't me!", as a rubber animal collides elastically with dale's head moments later.
Oct 19 22:55:14 <RatS_Rule>	well it seems i needed to restart emacs; for an unknow reasons my var was stuck in a previous form, thank youfor your patience dale 
Oct 19 23:00:14 <dale>	NP
Oct 19 23:12:06 <parsnip>	Welp, I think I'm just over this cafe, don't want to bother with this anymore.
Oct 19 23:12:32 <parsnip>	Hmm, hotspot would fix it, but I'm just ready for a walk anyways.
Oct 19 23:47:59 <parsnip>	offby1: i don't understand this Seattle reputation, for "passive aggressive", and "Seattle freeze".
Oct 19 23:49:42 <offby1>	me neither tbh
Oct 19 23:49:57 <offby1>	maybe I'm passive aggressive and chilly myself, so I don't notice
Oct 19 23:52:40 <bremner>	that kind of attitude is OK for some.
Oct 19 23:56:07 <edgar-rft>	I'd prefer to be actively aggessive, you assholes!
Oct 19 23:57:46 <Blackbeard[m]>	It is amazing how I've used Emacs for years now
Oct 19 23:57:48 <Blackbeard[m]>	And I still feel like I barely know it
Oct 19 23:58:18 <Blackbeard[m]>	Org-capture and org-protocol are amazing
Oct 20 00:01:17 <offby1>	tried M-x calc yet?
Oct 20 00:08:49 <Blackbeard[m]>	Oh yes, but only for the minimal, trivial multiplication or sums
Oct 20 00:08:55 <Blackbeard[m]>	Nothing fancy
Oct 20 00:09:28 <Blackbeard[m]>	I use stumpwm so basically I only use Emacs and firefox
Oct 20 00:09:48 <Blackbeard[m]>	I have been slowly changing everything to emacs
Oct 20 00:10:18 <work_>	dale: hello, I finally made the "use right command/option as another modifier" working on macOS (as Super in my keys). However, I notice that when I have Sticky Keys on, which I do a lot, it doesn't work
Oct 20 00:11:24 <Blackbeard[m]>	It is beautiful knowing your workflow will stay consistent for years to come
Oct 20 00:34:09 <gnomon>	Blackbeard[m], when you get into calc-mode and org-table you are going to _love_ them
Oct 20 01:10:02 <libertyp1ime>	Hey guys. I'm looking for a way to specify an arbitrary interpreter/compiler for babel blocks. Example here: http://ix.io/1ZfL/org
Oct 20 01:10:43 <libertyp1ime>	I have something which works but requires me to specify the babel source as 'sh'. That means I can't use yasnippets for the babel and it highlights incorrectly
Oct 20 01:11:36 <libertyp1ime>	I'd like to specify the interpreter so I can put code snippets rather than full source files into babel
Oct 20 01:12:08 <libertyp1ime>	for example, with graphviz-dot I would like in the future to specify only the graph edges and skip the boilerplate
Oct 20 01:12:43 <libertyp1ime>	for java i would like to specify System.out.println instead of an entire main function, etc
Oct 20 01:13:03 <libertyp1ime>	but for all languages i would like to make script which provide the boilerplate

Nov 07 15:00:02 <drdo>	Just wondering if there was an easy way to make this faster
Nov 07 15:00:09 <drdo>	I like magit, but the speed is an issue
Nov 07 15:00:14 <quiliro>	if it is slow on the command line, it is a networking (name solving or routing) problem
Nov 07 15:00:21 <drdo>	quiliro: it's not slow on the command line
Nov 07 15:00:25 <fledermaus>	you haven't asked a specific "this" so your question isn't really answerable.
Nov 07 15:01:09 <drdo>	fledermaus: magit
Nov 07 15:01:16 <drdo>	jesus, I can give you a specific command
Nov 07 15:01:21 <drdo>	But everything is slow
Nov 07 15:01:21 <fsbot>	Try: dlgs-phrases lamport-fix lebowski-data perlis-data stallman-fact-list
Nov 07 15:01:31 <drdo>	It's not subtle
Nov 07 15:01:33 <quiliro>	drdo: did you test magit by starting emacs without any config (emacs -Q)?
Nov 07 15:01:38 <drdo>	I'm not trying to be mysterious
Nov 07 15:01:48 <drdo>	quiliro: I haven't
Nov 07 15:03:03 <quiliro>	drdo: it might be some of your configurations...with 'emacs -Q' you use no configurations to compare
Nov 07 15:03:16 <drdo>	You can take magit-status for example
Nov 07 15:03:22 <drdo>	That takes like 2seconds
Nov 07 15:03:33 <drdo>	even on a repo with a few files and a couple commits
Nov 07 15:04:21 <fledermaus>	and as I said above, you can try customising magit-status-headers-hook

Nov 07 18:50:39 <zeta_0>	dale: so what does the error mean then ?
Nov 07 18:50:52 <dale>	zeta_0: Probably forgot to close something like a paren.
Nov 07 18:51:09 <chasecrum>	is anyone in here using mu4e by any chance?
Nov 07 18:53:32 <zeta_0>	dale: yes, i was missing a parenthesis, thanks
Nov 07 18:54:51 <zeta_0>	how would i translate this into use-package ? https://hastebin.com/avinodowuv.coffeescript
Nov 07 19:01:00 <macrover>	need help with coding sys error, http://ix.io/216x
Nov 07 19:02:16 <kenrestivo>	,spook
Nov 07 19:02:17 <fsbot>	From memory, ErcSpook is at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcSpook
Nov 07 19:03:38 <thblt>	macrover: this is a very weird issue, lucky you!
Nov 07 19:03:43 <kenrestivo>	wow "janet reno"? spook is *old*
Nov 07 19:03:57 <kenrestivo>	like 25 years old
Nov 07 19:03:59 <macrover>	thblt, ha! but not comforting
Nov 07 19:04:19 <thblt>	I've never seen this, but if " (utf-8 (194982 . 4194252) (194983 . 4194177) (195019 . 4194252)" is a list of buffer positions, you may be able to actually identify the characters Emacs chokes on.
Nov 07 19:05:00 <thblt>	Or maybe character positions/characters conses?
Nov 07 19:05:00 <macrover>	thblt these are all hyphens or quote characters \ ', no foreign chars
Nov 07 19:08:02 <dale>	macrover: I'd open it in hexl-mode/xxd/od/hex editor and see what was at those positions.
Nov 07 19:08:36 <dale>	macrover: I'm hoping that right around 194982 you'll find 3F FF CC.  But I'm just guessing at how to read that error.
Nov 07 19:08:55 <quiliro>	howard-abrams: did you test with emacs -Q ?
Nov 07 19:08:56 <macrover>	2019-11-07 10:08 <dale> at that position: Yves-Marie de L'Isle André, Breton, France
Nov 07 19:09:11 <dale>	macrover: Did you read that in org-mode or in hexl-mode?
Nov 07 19:09:23 <quiliro>	maybe it is the wrong person to suggest that to :-(
Nov 07 19:09:25 <macrover>	org mode
Nov 07 19:09:34 <thblt>	macrover: what do you mean? Those values are far from \ and '
Nov 07 19:09:38 <dale>	macrover: Open it in a hex editor and see what bytes are there, I don't trust Emacs after it's opened the buffer.
Nov 07 19:09:59 <thblt>	macrover: also do you get that when saving, or at any other moment? 
Nov 07 19:10:28 <edgar-rft>	org is great, it gives us errors we've never seen before
Nov 07 19:11:06 <macrover>	thblt, you're right the char is ' over e in French. I get that error randomly while I'm doing somethign else. the file's saved properly, opens properly. The error pops as a new buffer.
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	it seems like this piece of code fixed it: `(use-package company
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	  :config
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	  (progn
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	    (global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'company-complete-common-or-cycle)
Nov 07 19:11:11 <zeta_0>	    (setq company-idle-delay 0)))`
Nov 07 19:11:11 <dale>	For the record, I think this is standard Emacs text encoding complaint.
Nov 07 19:11:38 <dale>	The only thing I'm not sure about is why it's in " *temp file*".
Nov 07 19:11:52 <cvandusen>	zeta_0: You don't need the progn 
Nov 07 19:12:27 <macrover>	yes, I was wondering too, but some of those src_blocks in org-mode actually crate eps files for graphs; they are generated fine with no errors
Nov 07 19:12:29 <thblt>	macrover: M-x toggle-debug-on-error?  I don't know if it will help, but worth a try.
Nov 07 19:12:33 <cvandusen>	and add-hook can be written :hook (after-init . global-company-mode)
Nov 07 19:12:43 <macrover>	thblt, ok will try 
Nov 07 19:20:53 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: something, something, something
Nov 07 19:20:53 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: i could do it with browse-url just wondering if there is something better
Nov 07 19:21:02 <thblt>	The error itself seems to come from `select-safe-coding-system-interactively`
Nov 07 19:22:17 <macrover>	thblt, fwiw, the error stops when I disable helm; helm is triggering the error in the first place
Nov 07 19:22:35 <thblt>	It gets better <3
Nov 07 19:23:06 <thblt>	I love these weird errors (provided they don't happen to me)
Nov 07 19:23:22 <macrover>	thblt, ha ha, ty, bye
Nov 07 19:24:07 <thblt>	Does it really happen arbitrarily or when you try to do something?  Like it doesn't happen when Emacs is idling?
Nov 07 19:24:20 <thblt>	And if so, do you remember what you were doing?
Nov 07 19:24:23 <macrover>	only when idling
Nov 07 19:24:36 <thblt>	Not even typing?
Nov 07 19:24:37 <macrover>	it does not interrupt when I do other things
Nov 07 19:24:49 <macrover>	sometimes
Nov 07 19:25:27 <macrover>	I'm looking at autosave and other thigns happening in the background
Nov 07 19:26:42 <dale>	macrover: If you want help analyzing a stack trace, pastebin it somewhere and I'll take a look.
Nov 07 19:26:46 <dale>	Gotta admit I'm intrigued.
Nov 07 19:27:17 <thblt>	macrover: auto backups maybe?
Nov 07 19:27:33 <thblt>	Yes, Emacs is talking about temp-file
Nov 07 19:27:37 <macrover>	thblt, yes that may be it
Nov 07 19:27:51 <macrover>	got a stack trace, will paste bin it shortly
Nov 07 19:27:54 <thblt>	Hey, that's a good question, why would use a temp file?
Nov 07 19:28:00 <thblt>	what not why
Nov 07 19:29:04 <dale>	I would not be surprised if part of the process of opening a new buffer involves creating a temporary buffer with some/all of the file's content where Emacs can go nuts trying to guess the encoding and/or maybe reading prop line variables.
Nov 07 19:29:33 <macrover>	http://ix.io/216E
Nov 07 19:30:12 <dale>	Hm, OK, so " *temp file*" is from with-temp-file.
Nov 07 19:30:53 <thblt>	macrover: was this triggered from toggle-debug-on-error?
Nov 07 19:31:50 <dale>	Am I correctly reading that stack trace as a timer that fires calling save-some-buffers?
Nov 07 19:32:00 <macrover>	thblt, yes from toggle-debug-on-error
Nov 07 19:32:03 <thblt>	excellent
Nov 07 19:32:28 <dale>	Then you end up inside helm because it's trying to prompt for the encoding of /Users/sjeer/org/codingsystemerror.text...
Nov 07 19:32:30 <macrover>	dale, I traced to an autosave macro
Nov 07 19:34:12 <dale>	WTF... #f(advice-wrapper :override ivy-completing-read helm--completing-read-default)(
Nov 07 19:34:56 <dale>	Is that... read-coding-system calling completing-read-function, which may or may not be set to ivy-completing-read, but which is then ... is that ivy-completing-read being overridden with helm--completing-read-default via advice?
Nov 07 19:35:09 <macrover>	dale, don't know the wrapper thing. I wrote that autosave macro  a long time ago and don't quite know what's going on; it worked fine as a after-save hook
Nov 07 19:35:46 <macrover>	dale, perhaps -- but why now and not before?
Nov 07 19:36:01 <dale>	macrover: Oh, I haven't the foggiest what would have changed for you.
Nov 07 19:36:12 <dale>	macrover: Are you really using both Ivy and Helm?
Nov 07 19:36:14 <dale>	Maybe this is more common than I am aware.
Nov 07 19:36:30 <macrover>	I disabled the after-save hook and no more errors
Nov 07 19:37:53 <macrover>	yes, didn't know I was
Nov 07 19:38:56 <macrover>	dale now I know the source of error, ty for the help.
Nov 07 19:40:13 <dale>	macrover: NP, I wouldn't be surprised if your raw-text changes would have done the job, but they didn't help because save-buffer was being interrupted by an error trying to prompt you about encoding.
Nov 07 19:57:03 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: is there a noodle in your poodle?
Nov 07 19:57:08 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: rudel poodle strudel
Nov 07 19:57:42 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: you're going nuts now?
Nov 07 19:57:43 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: If we don't do something now to protect them they're just going to be hunted by those right wing gun nuts.
Nov 07 19:58:02 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: you're wandering off the point
Nov 07 19:58:03 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I'm using the variable width setup with circe and while it works great, I notice point sometimes wandering off
Nov 07 19:58:22 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: don't beat around the bush!

Dec 08 17:44:26 <Lordveda>	Hello People
Dec 08 17:45:05 <Lordveda>	Does Centaur Emacs have a specific room on irc.freenode.net
Dec 08 17:45:06 <Lordveda>	??
Dec 08 17:45:07 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Dec 08 17:45:46 <bremner>	Lordveda: never heard of it. Did you try asking alis the bot?
Dec 08 17:46:11 <Lordveda>	No, because I don't know about it
Dec 08 17:46:23 <bremner>	Now I know how those grumpy old debian developers feel about all of the derivative distros. Oh wait...
Dec 08 17:46:45 <Lordveda>	I don't use debian :)
Dec 08 17:46:48 <bremner>	rudybot: there are DDs way grumpier than me, honest.
Dec 08 17:46:52 <rudybot>	bremner: Is it just me, or has the channel been grumpier than usual lately?

On the Day of Resurrection your EMACS will resolve for them their differences.
Dec 08 17:54:19 <phil1751>	Hello, what is a regex which does not match a specific sub-string like 'xyz' ? 
Dec 08 17:54:45 <wasamasa>	there is no such thing
Dec 08 17:54:49 <wasamasa>	not in elisp anyway
Dec 08 17:59:06 <q[corwin]>	Multi-stage external filter was intimidating as hell to setup but smell is gone asap.
Dec 08 17:59:59 <edgar-rft>	I think the regex "abc" wouldn't match the substring "xyz".
Dec 08 18:33:03 <lxbarbosa>	well, that makes sense. :)
Dec 08 19:06:38 <dto>	emacs 27 sure has a bumper crop of fancy new thingies this time around!
Dec 08 19:06:45 <dto>	backtrace-mode pop ups
Dec 08 19:06:51 <dto>	so cool!
Dec 08 19:06:57 <dto>	tab bars
Dec 08 19:06:58 <dto>	tab lines
Dec 08 19:07:32 <dto>	improved minibuffer pretty printing of EIEIO objects!
Dec 08 19:08:07 <shapr>	is emacs 27 released?
Dec 08 19:08:12 <bremner>	no
Dec 08 19:08:22 <dto>	nope i'm using 27.0.50 from git head.
Dec 08 19:09:57 <dto>	also it seems snappier and more responsive in general.
Dec 08 19:10:00 <bremner>	releases are for old people.
Dec 08 19:10:08 <dto>	improved EIEIO linting
Dec 08 19:10:25 <dto>	so much fancyness and schmancyness
Dec 08 19:10:37 <dto>	i couldn't even finish the news fiile, it got late
Dec 08 19:10:42 <dto>	how ru bremner 
Dec 08 19:11:28 <bremner>	I've never even been to ru!
Dec 08 19:11:34 <dto>	heh
Dec 08 19:11:35 <dto>	;)
Dec 08 19:11:53 <dto>	sorry to use SMS-speak on IRC. i guess it is a faux pas
Dec 08 19:12:12 <bremner>	yeah. better than a real pas though
Dec 08 19:12:30 <dto>	(play-sound "drumroll.wav")
Dec 08 19:12:32 <dto>	;)
Dec 08 19:23:25 <dto>	Emacs is like frigging Unicron at this point. it should be voiced by Orson Welles.
Dec 08 19:26:34 <dto>	imagine Orson Welles saying "Buffer has no process."
Dec 08 19:26:48 <dto>	or "Command attempted to use minibuffer while in minibuffer"
Dec 08 19:39:56 <notzmv>	nice
Dec 08 19:41:54 <bremner>	are you calling emacs fat?
Dec 08 19:53:33 <winny>	my emacs is fat
Dec 08 20:07:06 <JordiGH>	Hm, there's no fancier Emacs SQL mode out here?
Dec 08 20:09:57 <bbuccianti>	,help
Dec 08 20:09:57 <fsbot>	bbuccianti, help is PM me and type help-erbot
Dec 08 20:13:04 <kensanata>	JordiGH: There used to be!
Dec 08 20:13:24 <JordiGH>	kensanata: tell me more.
Dec 08 20:13:28 <JordiGH>	sql-mode is so... dumb.
Dec 08 20:13:37 <kensanata>	JordiGH: As far as I remember, they were tied to certain vendor, though. SQL*Plus by Oracle, for example.
Dec 08 20:14:06 <JordiGH>	I just want better indentation and syntax highlighting.
Dec 08 20:14:49 <kensanata>	JordiGH: Hm. I thought highlighting was pretty good. What are you missing?
Dec 08 20:15:07 <kensanata>	JordiGH: One easy thing to miss is that you need to switch away from ANSI highlighting if you want fancier stuff?
Dec 08 20:15:16 <JordiGH>	It's really dumb about highlighting stuff in the wrong context.
Dec 08 20:15:21 <kensanata>	Ah.
Dec 08 20:15:28 <JordiGH>	For example, if I have a SQL column named value, it highlights it.
Dec 08 20:15:36 <JordiGH>	Even if I write "value" it also highlights it.
Dec 08 20:15:51 <kensanata>	Yeah... That's simple fontlocking...
Dec 08 20:16:14 <JordiGH>	It also seems to be as dumb as fundamental-mode for indentation.
Dec 08 20:16:18 <kensanata>	All I can say is that at the office I switched from SQL mode to DBeaver...
Dec 08 20:16:22 <wasamasa>	let's switch to yi and write parsers for every major mode
Dec 08 20:16:28 <kensanata>	Yeah, there's no indentation standard.
Dec 08 20:16:45 <wasamasa>	there's a package for indentation
Dec 08 20:16:47 <kensanata>	JordiGH: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SqlIndent
Dec 08 20:16:51 <JordiGH>	There's no indentation standard for C either but we try.
Dec 08 20:16:56 <wasamasa>	it's available in GNU ELPA
Dec 08 20:17:13 <kensanata>	JordiGH: https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-sql-postgres
Dec 08 20:17:53 <JordiGH>	Ooh, nicferrier.
Dec 08 20:17:56 <JordiGH>	,libation
Dec 08 20:17:57 *	fsbot pours one out for those we have lost.
Dec 08 20:18:14 <oni-on-ion>	ty
Dec 08 20:18:27 <JordiGH>	What does "pro" mean on his github profile?
Dec 08 20:18:45 <wasamasa>	paid
Dec 08 20:19:13 <JordiGH>	He paid for github??
Dec 08 20:19:13 <fsbot>	It is certain!
Dec 08 20:19:19 <technomancy>	lol
Dec 08 20:19:21 <JordiGH>	lol
Dec 08 20:19:58 <bremner>	rudybot: pro-stitute has a stigma, so let's replace it with sex-worker, or sex for short.
Dec 08 20:20:19 <rudybot>	bremner: not to mention the social stigma
Dec 08 20:20:29 <bremner>	uh. right.
Dec 08 20:22:45 <bbuccianti>	hey he can be using github for students
Dec 08 20:22:51 <bbuccianti>	that makes you a pro user of github
Dec 08 20:24:24 <dd7>	Are there any standard/good patterns for temporarily disabling `cursor-sensor-mode`? I believe that the control variable `cursor-sensor-inhibit` cannot be `let`-bound, because the redisplay hook runs in a different thread.
Dec 08 20:25:01 <wasamasa>	JordiGH: https://github.com/pricing
Dec 08 20:26:34 <JordiGH>	wasamasa: Not clicking on that, you little shill, you.
Dec 08 20:26:52 <wasamasa>	it explains what exactly the "pro" part means
Dec 08 20:27:01 <wasamasa>	including the situation where you can get it for free as a student
Dec 08 20:28:40 <JordiGH>	Look man, I'm busy polishing my dotemacs here.
Dec 08 20:30:15 <bbuccianti>	dotemacs pro
Dec 08 20:32:56 <dd7>	I have something working like `(setq cursor-sensor-inhibit '(my-reason)) ... (do-my-thing) ... (run-with-idle-timer 0 nil (lambda () (setq cursor-sensor-inhibit nil)))`, which appears to work. Does anyone see a better way?
Dec 08 20:33:35 <dd7>	(I haven't tested the 0 delay thoroughly but it appeared to work on first few tries)
Dec 08 20:33:42 <bbuccianti>	I realized that when i'm looking for something with isearch and my cursor is on the other end I can press the complement. If searching forward and I'm in the right word, I can press C-r and it moves cursor to the beginning
Dec 08 20:33:49 <bbuccianti>	emacs rocks!
Dec 08 21:09:54 <JordiGH>	And thus the dotemacs grows yet again: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/shortlog/@
Dec 08 21:15:01 <caoliver>	How do people manage to wind up with so much crud in emacs?
Dec 08 21:15:28 *	caoliver has this is /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp: http://ix.io/23Uy
Dec 08 21:19:56 <johnjay>	caoliver: as soon as my init.el got over a few screenfuls of text i organized it slightly with headers in comments
Dec 08 21:20:27 <johnjay>	e.g. ;;*Lisp, ;;**Lisp Debugging, ;;***Specialized Lisp Debugging, ;;****Something
Dec 08 21:20:33 <caoliver>	Mine is about 270 lines.
Dec 08 21:21:19 <caoliver>	Keys bind file is 113.
Dec 08 21:21:53 <caoliver>	Small lisp utils 70lines.
Dec 08 21:22:09 <caoliver>	I guess I'm just not one of the cool kids.
Dec 08 21:22:53 <wasamasa>	I have a tiny emacs config for work
Dec 08 21:22:54 <JordiGH>	527 lines: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/file/@/dotemacs.el
Dec 08 21:24:18 <caoliver>	I think I have of the not-always-needed set as autoloads.
Dec 08 21:24:50 <caoliver>	There are a handful of things that really need to be required.  (I think auctex is one of those)
Dec 08 21:25:17 <caoliver>	bookmark+ and annot seem to need to really be loaded.
Dec 08 21:25:57 <caoliver>	as do key-chord and key-seq.
Dec 08 21:26:34 <johnjay>	mine has 246 lines. also apparently call-process doesn't do any shell interpretation. crap
Dec 08 21:27:58 <johnjay>	wasamasa: i was thinking about how racket is still clearly educational project
Dec 08 21:28:08 <johnjay>	does that mean scheme in general is more useful for learning things than for "doing work"?
Dec 08 21:28:48 <wasamasa>	dunno
Dec 08 21:28:53 *	caoliver would look at Chez for serious stuff.
Dec 08 21:28:56 <wasamasa>	I happen to have used it for work
Dec 08 21:28:58 <caoliver>	But I'm weird.
Dec 08 21:29:09 <wasamasa>	there are a bunch of other people who did the same
Dec 08 21:29:19 <wasamasa>	personally I'm happier to use it for hobbyist projects
Dec 08 21:29:28 <johnjay>	well like if you wanted to mess with sql. or networking, or specialized math stuff or xml
Dec 08 21:29:33 <wasamasa>	I've currently dedusted one of those and am going through a test suite
Dec 08 21:30:17 *	caoliver is more likely to be fully demented and play with SBCL for that sort of leaning.
Dec 08 21:30:51 <caoliver>	Don't get me wrong.  There are differences between CL and Scheme that I find annoying.
Dec 08 21:31:45 *	caoliver tends to beat on LuaJIT these days though.  Annoying syntax.  Occasionally annoying semantics.  But damn it's both small and fast.
Dec 08 21:32:16 <wasamasa>	did you try fennel?
Dec 08 21:33:19 <technomancy>	caoliver: if you're a lisper who's done a lot with luajit have you taken a look at Fennel?
Dec 08 21:33:21 <caoliver>	I gave it a look, but I found some annoyances.  I had hoped for a Lisp REPL like feel, but it felt weird and alien.
Dec 08 21:33:32 <technomancy>	jinx
Dec 08 21:33:50 <technomancy>	hm; because of not having cons cells, or something else?
Dec 08 21:33:59 <caoliver>	Like all the fun backquote stuff didn't seem to work.
Dec 08 21:34:15 <technomancy>	oh, how long ago did you look at it?
Dec 08 21:34:20 <technomancy>	backquote was added less than a year ago
Dec 08 21:34:40 <caoliver>	OK.  Probably after my glancing.
Dec 08 21:34:52 <technomancy>	just curious
Dec 08 21:37:01 <technomancy>	I found it to be very useful without backtick, but I can see how it might be disorienting
Dec 08 21:37:29 <johnjay>	JordiGH: rainbow-mode ftw
Dec 08 21:48:23 <johnjay>	hrm. is there any benefit to having custom-set variables be at the end of the .emacs file?
Dec 08 21:52:56 <offby1>	as opposed to earlier?
Dec 08 21:57:31 <johnjay>	i guess.
Dec 08 21:57:43 <johnjay>	it's not really customary to just edit it directly is it?
Dec 08 21:57:53 <johnjay>	that's the only thing i can think of
Dec 08 21:59:24 <enyo-eris>	test
Dec 08 21:59:48 <enyo-eris>	Is anyone here? I'm testing my ERC configuration.
Dec 08 22:00:57 <notzmv>	hi enyo-eris 
Dec 08 22:00:58 <bbuccianti>	,ping
Dec 08 22:00:58 <fsbot>	␕
Dec 08 22:02:54 <enyo-eris>	Cool. So it works. Now to configure it more. Thanks.
Dec 08 22:04:58 <notzmv>	yw comrade
Dec 08 22:07:00 <johnjay>	in server.el is the reason you run (server-start) so that you can remotely login to emacs?
Dec 08 22:07:17 <johnjay>	otherwise i don't see why you use it
Dec 08 22:17:49 <offby1>	it's so you can connect to emacs with emacsclient
Dec 08 22:17:56 <offby1>	now, why would you want to do that?  I dunno
Dec 08 22:18:20 <offby1>	"remotely login to emacs" doesn't really mean anything
Dec 08 22:20:00 <offby1>	oh wait -- it's so that when you're using an interactive shell in emacs -- like M-x shell-mode RET -- you can set the EDITOR environment variable to "emacsclient", and then if you run a program, in that shell, that tries to edit something (like the thing-that-I-never-use that edits /etc/passwd) it'll just open a new emacs buffer, instead of trying to e.g. launch vim in the *shell* buffer, which would be a mess
Dec 08 22:35:00 <johnjay>	i... see
Dec 08 22:35:17 <johnjay>	"remotely login" meaning, if host A has emacs on it and i want to connect to it from host B
Dec 08 22:35:23 <johnjay>	as in like when i start a tmux up or something
Dec 08 22:35:31 <johnjay>	but i guess yeah you can just use tmux for that
Dec 08 22:36:15 <johnjay>	JordiGH: is there going to be a line in this dotemacs that defines a command highlight-current-line and binds it to double-clicking mouse-1?
Dec 08 22:36:23 <johnjay>	because i just realized i need this
Dec 08 22:36:42 <johnjay>	hrm, emacs already does it if i triple-click. odd
Dec 08 22:41:38 <JordiGH>	johnjay: do not wnat
Dec 08 22:42:43 <johnjay>	i just figured out how apply-ansi-color-on-region works
Dec 08 22:42:45 <johnjay>	mind = blown
Dec 08 22:43:03 <johnjay>	er ansi-color-apply
Dec 08 22:47:09 <JordiGH>	From my dotemacs?
Dec 08 22:48:50 <johnjay>	yes i'm trying to scavenge anything I can. 
Dec 08 22:48:56 <johnjay>	like Rey on Jaaku
Dec 08 22:50:21 <JordiGH>	Well, that's what it's for.
Dec 08 22:51:14 <johnjay>	i should probably share my init.el now that i figured out that cool paren matching feature
Dec 08 22:51:40 <johnjay>	it's like show-paren-mode but it highlights ( vertically
Dec 08 22:52:28 <johnjay>	but yeah i wanted to ask you specifically. do you ever edit custom-set-variables?
Dec 08 22:52:43 <johnjay>	i was wondering if i should move mine to the end of the file for that purpose
Dec 08 22:54:05 <JordiGH>	Y'know what, let's make it official: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/rev/ceff26bc036e
Dec 08 22:54:36 <JordiGH>	johnjay: I happily use M-x customize and let it do whatever it wants at the bottom of my file.
Dec 08 22:55:24 <johnjay>	ok
Dec 08 22:57:00 <johnjay>	you used legalese to add a copyright notice?
Dec 08 22:57:19 <JordiGH>	Yep.
Dec 08 22:57:23 <JordiGH>	M-x legalese
Dec 08 22:58:00 <johnjay>	ah you have to do M-< first or it inserts at point
Dec 08 22:59:41 <johnjay>	also random question i wondered before
Dec 08 22:59:48 <johnjay>	can you insert evalled expressions into a minibuffer?
Dec 08 22:59:52 <johnjay>	like with a recursive edit or something?
Dec 08 23:00:16 <johnjay>	i wanted to do something like (setq init "/home/johnjay/.emacs.d/init.el")
Dec 08 23:00:23 <johnjay>	then C-x C-f init
Dec 08 23:49:18 <q[corwin]>	JordiGH: I'm doing same as johnjay. tyvm
Dec 08 23:49:44 <JordiGH>	Yeah, sure.
Dec 08 23:50:03 <JordiGH>	Curious to know what you might find useful.
Dec 08 23:50:36 <q[corwin]>	well, that's the great part about adding the BS at the top- even if I can't find you on IRC I can let you knwo :)
Dec 08 23:50:44 <q[corwin]>	s/knwo/know
Dec 08 23:53:35 <JordiGH>	Oh, 'cause my email is ther.e
Dec 08 23:53:56 <q[corwin]>	yea\
Dec 08 23:54:22 <johnjay>	q[corwin]: i updated the paren-highlighting code so now it only comes on when show-parens is activated, not all the time
Dec 08 23:54:39 <johnjay>	plus idk why i made which-function-mode activate for just elisp. the file says it works for c, perl, and a bunch of things
Dec 08 23:55:04 <johnjay>	JordiGH: i'm adding everything but the requires and things i don't usually use like matlab
Dec 08 23:55:30 <johnjay>	also stripes doesn't exist in melpa so idk what it is
Dec 08 23:55:32 <JordiGH>	I probably have some cruft here, but he, cba to clean up.
Dec 08 23:55:52 <johnjay>	gotcha
Dec 08 23:58:44 <johnjay>	this tabbar thing is confusing. it automatically creates groups for you
Dec 08 23:58:51 <johnjay>	at least it lets you close them

Dec 17 08:27:38 <twb>	Doe USA still have a "flag day" ?
Dec 17 08:27:54 <twb>	I don't mean a day to make a brute-force transition to a New World Order
Dec 17 08:28:05 <twb>	I mean like going "hooray, we have a flag" and drinking beer or whatever
Dec 17 08:29:30 <twb>	Yeah looks like they still have that.  Weirdly, they celebrate adopting a flag that they stopped using ages ago
Dec 17 08:31:03 <Sketch>	july 4th?
Dec 17 08:31:03 <twb>	Yeah their flag day celebrates a flag that was *neither* the first US federal flag *nor* the current one.
Dec 17 08:31:21 <twb>	Sketch: no it's June 14
Dec 17 08:32:39 <twb>	The reason I know about it at all is because in sysadmin circles it's the name for a day where you fuck up all the users at once - and it's so called because in USA, they do that on "flag day" because the users are at home drunk and unable to stop you
Dec 17 08:34:52 <Sketch>	i've never heard of this in sysadmin circles (particularly american ones)
Dec 17 08:35:05 <twb>	Sketch: blame esr
Dec 17 08:36:27 <twb>	Someone should convince Trump to switch back from flags to standards.
Dec 17 08:36:35 <twb>	that would offer any number of hilarious puns
Dec 17 08:44:00 <twb>	Huh so USA ordered some guy called "Matt Perry" to stop people shipping slaves to itself.  It took him nearly six months to stop each ship.
Dec 17 08:44:08 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Slave_Trade_Patrol
Dec 17 08:45:22 <twb>	It sounds like it wasn't his fault, though, the US government made sure he couldn't do anything
Dec 17 08:47:01 <twb>	Ah, Perry is the guy who sailed up to Japan and said "buy our consumer goods our we'll fuck up your country"

Jan 02 17:13:20 <str1ngs>	see with ':test as well
Jan 02 17:13:38 <str1ngs>	in this case :test is a symbol
Jan 02 17:13:47 <thblt>	a keyword is like a symbol, excepts it evaluates to itself, so it's easier to use as, err, a keyword. (let ((whatever "something")) (list (eval 'whatever) (eval ':whatever)))
Jan 02 17:14:00 <dale>	str1ngs: And no, the keyword symbol :test is not the same as the symbol test.
Jan 02 17:14:06 <dale>	,(eq 'test :test)
Jan 02 17:14:06 <fsbot>	D'oh!  Symbol’s value as variable is void: fs-:test
Jan 02 17:14:21 <dale>	Well, that evaluates to nil, trust me.
Jan 02 17:14:41 <str1ngs>	if it's "quoted" 
Jan 02 17:14:55 <str1ngs>	,(eq 'test ':test)
Jan 02 17:14:55 <fsbot>	nil  ..(symbol)
Jan 02 17:14:55 <Greth>	str1ngs: ah thank you, so this would be the right track for documentation? https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Common-Keywords.html is it specific to emacs customization tools?
Jan 02 17:15:00 <dale>	str1ngs: Er, sorry, I meant to direct my comment to Greth, not you.
Jan 02 17:15:11 <str1ngs>	dale: no worries
Jan 02 17:15:13 <mphojele>	Greth: Think of :word as in when a function takes a lots of arguments and giving it positional arguments would be to much work, so you take a shortcut. I think in C-like languages it looks like this: console.log(message="Hello World") 
Jan 02 17:15:27 <dale>	str1ngs: That is an interesting quirk of fsbot that I look forward to forgetting many more times in the future, thank you.
Jan 02 17:16:04 <str1ngs>	dale: I mostly use scheme is if I'm wrong about a nuance and need correct that's okay :)
Jan 02 17:16:10 <str1ngs>	so if*
Jan 02 17:17:08 <thblt>	A keyword is a different type of atom than a symbol, although the internal representation is usally very close or the very same, except for the type tag of course.
Jan 02 17:17:44 <thblt>	(Usually, some sort of integer)
Jan 02 17:17:50 <str1ngs>	that's good to know. 
Jan 02 17:18:42 <str1ngs>	does elisp have a class-of function like guile?
Jan 02 17:19:09 <str1ngs>	class-of returns the type of a binding
Jan 02 17:19:16 <thblt>	,,df class-of
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	class-of is an alias for ‘eieio-object-class’ in ‘eieio.el’.
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	(class-of OBJ)
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	This function is obsolete since 24.4;
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	use ‘eieio-object-class’ instead.
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	Return the class struct defining OBJ.
Jan 02 17:19:38 <dale>	thblt: Hm, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbol-Components.html reads to me that a keyword is a type of symbol.
Jan 02 17:19:50 <str1ngs>	thblt: thank you
Jan 02 17:20:06 <dale>	,(type-of :foo)
Jan 02 17:20:06 <fsbot>	Oh sh**!  Symbol’s value as variable is void: fs-:foo
Jan 02 17:20:10 <dale>	,(type-of ':foo)
Jan 02 17:20:10 <fsbot>	symbol  ..(symbol)
Jan 02 17:20:23 <thblt>	dale: yes, the difference is in semantics, not internal representation.
Jan 02 17:20:24 <dale>	str1ngs: See?  Already forgetting!
Jan 02 17:20:57 <thblt>	funny, type-of identifies them as symbol too. Weirds. 
Jan 02 17:21:23 <thblt>	Well, I have no issue with calling them symbols, but then we need a distinct name for “proper” symbols.
Jan 02 17:22:19 <str1ngs>	,(type-of (current-buffer))
Jan 02 17:22:19 <fsbot>	whoops,  Symbol’s function definition is void: fs-current-buffer
Jan 02 17:22:38 <str1ngs>	lol why cant we write to fsbot's buffers?
Jan 02 17:22:46 <thblt>	Apparently in Emacs a symbol is "a symbol whose name starts with ‘:’". So it's really absolutely the same. Fun.
Jan 02 17:22:50 <thblt>	(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables)
Jan 02 17:23:18 <cvandusen>	a bot's buffers are sacrosanct
Jan 02 17:23:59 <dale>	thblt: I thought this was also the case in Common Lisp, but perhaps I was misled.
Jan 02 17:24:17 <thblt>	And because Elisp is fun, you can even setq a keyword, but… only to itself: (setq :keyword :keyword), but not (setq :keyword :nothing)
Jan 02 17:25:57 <dale>	thblt: Huh!
Jan 02 17:26:16 <dale>	thblt: Recently bpalmer and I were noticing that, in recent Emacs, you can let bind keywords, which is probably a bug.
Jan 02 17:26:29 <dale>	Ex. (let ((:foo 42)) :foo) → 42

Jan 02 17:34:39 <parsnip>	do you agree pandoc conversion of docx tables to org should not add two spaces like |_blah___|
Jan 02 17:34:42 <dale>	Hi parsnip.
Jan 02 17:35:38 <dale>	parsnip: Why would it be necessary or even useful to add those spaces?  I don't immediately see any good reason, though I'm not super-familiar with org-mode markup.  Unless that question has a good answer, I think "yes, I agree".
Jan 02 17:35:57 <thblt>	parsnip: FWIW, pandoc conversion goes through an abstract intermediate representation, so your issue is either with the docx reader or the org writer. 
Jan 02 17:36:22 <parsnip>	oh right, so i should test with an html -> org conversion maybe
Jan 02 17:36:47 <Greth>	Thank you guys for the help :) appreciated the descussion afterwords as well.
Jan 02 17:36:55 <thblt>	Isn't it just to keep the | aligned on all rows?
Jan 02 17:37:43 <thblt>	Or does it add extra spaces beyond what's needed?
Jan 02 17:37:49 <parsnip>	yes, the latter
Jan 02 17:38:04 <parsnip>	there should be one space beyond max width
Jan 02 17:38:10 <parsnip>	but instead there are three
Jan 02 17:38:35 <parsnip>	it looks like it's same for my round trip script through html

Jan 02 17:49:25 <npostavs>	thblt, dale: it works in lexical-binding mode, but not in dynamic binding mode for me (emacs 26)
Jan 02 17:49:45 <dale>	Oh, in IELM lexical-binding → t.
Jan 02 17:50:08 <dale>	And in *scratch*.
Jan 02 17:50:18 <dale>	npostavs: Is this expected behavior?
Jan 02 17:50:20 <thblt>	Ignore me you were right, I can reproduce.
Jan 02 17:50:38 <thblt>	HEAD now declares itself to be 28.50, 27 is coming.
Jan 02 17:51:38 <thblt>	(I guess I could have learned this by following emacs-devel too)
Jan 02 17:54:11 <npostavs>	dale: maybe?  It kind of makes sense, because lexically binding a symbol doesn't actually modify the symbol-value slot.
Jan 02 17:56:19 <bandali>	npostavs, hey, do you use erc by any chance? i was wondering if you could review yet another patch of mine
Jan 02 17:56:40 <npostavs>	bandali: no, rcirc actually
Jan 02 17:57:01 <bandali>	ah..
Jan 02 17:57:08 <thblt>	But keywords arent't supposed to evaluate to anything except themselves
Jan 02 17:57:23 *	thblt tries with 25
Jan 02 17:58:08 <bandali>	in any case, i’d appreciate more eyes on this: https://bugs.gnu.org/38257
Jan 02 17:58:13 <thblt>	Error. So there's a bug somewhere between 26 and HEAD. Reporting it.
Jan 02 17:58:18 <bandali>	(for anyone else who uses ERC)
Jan 02 17:58:26 <bandali>	would be nice if it could make it for 27
Jan 02 18:06:52 <neuro_sys>	Is it possible to make Flycheck ignore a missing config file? Or is it Checker specific, in this case javascript-eslint.
Jan 02 18:06:57 <dale>	thblt: Thanks, I never got around to it.
Jan 02 18:07:17 <thblt>	No, the bug, if it's a bug, is also in 25
Jan 02 18:07:44 <thblt>	But in all versions it requires `lexical-binding` to be t, which I guess is the default in 28
Jan 02 18:10:03 <dale>	I feel like it's probably bad that keywords can ever not evaluate to themselves.
Jan 02 18:10:51 <thblt>	Isn't that the whole point of keywords?
Jan 02 18:12:00 <thblt>	(honest question! I may be missing something)
Jan 02 18:13:24 <wasamasa>	why would let-binding a keyword even work, wtf
Jan 02 18:13:36 <dale>	I'm imagining code like (defun write-file (path &optional overwrite) "... If OVERWRITE is :prompt then the user will be prompted." ...) but someone does (let ((:prompt t)) (function-that-calls-write-file)).
Jan 02 18:14:07 <wasamasa>	and why would lexical-binding ever be the default
Jan 02 18:14:07 <grym>	if i have launched emacs, is there a way to convert that pid into an emacsclient instead? (does that question even parse?) 
Jan 02 18:14:20 <jeremy_c>	Is there a way for melpa to read my README.org instead of my elisp comments when it creates the -readme.txt file?
Jan 02 18:14:48 <wasamasa>	melpa reuses standard emacs functionality for that, so sure, change what emacs does and wait a few years
Jan 02 18:15:06 <jeremy_c>	wasamasa: OK, so no ;-)

Jan 02 18:15:30 <wasamasa>	alternatively, convince them of that being a good idea

Jan 02 18:20:18 <thblt>	(I don't know why I leave all the noise M-x report-emacs-bug creates for this kind of issue.)
Jan 02 18:20:25 <wasamasa>	well, it's likelier to happen, an .org file isn't part of the package, so there's less incentive for emacs to support that
Jan 02 18:20:34 <wasamasa>	I could see melpa looking at the repository for a readme file
Jan 02 18:21:05 <thblt>	They may accept a patch adding a :readme option to the recipe.
Jan 02 18:29:13 <spudpnds>	grym: like you want to take an existing emacs process and convert it into a client.
Jan 02 18:30:00 <thblt>	You may start the server with M-x server-start, but it won't be exactly the same as emacs --daemon
Jan 02 18:30:16 <grym>	spudpnds: yes
Jan 02 18:30:25 <bpalmer>	what does that mean, to turn it into a client?
Jan 02 18:30:40 <bpalmer>	you opened up  an emacs and wish you were inside another emacs process?
Jan 02 18:30:51 <spudpnds>	I think it means connecting it to a server.
Jan 02 18:31:01 <grym>	^ that
Jan 02 18:31:05 <spudpnds>	I'm pretty sure there is not M-x client-start ;)
Jan 02 18:31:17 <bpalmer>	M-: (shell-command "emacsclient &") RET
Jan 02 18:31:26 <bpalmer>	unless you really care about process identity
Jan 02 18:31:46 <grym>	bpalmer: i don't, particularly.   thanks! 
Jan 02 18:32:24 <grym>	 ooo it's C-x # now not C-x 5 0 ... ? 
Jan 02 18:32:25 <bpalmer>	which isn't that different from just closing emacs and then typing emacsclient instead. 
Jan 02 18:32:44 <grym>	(just bumped to 26.3)
Jan 02 18:32:46 <bpalmer>	(It 'looks' like you're opening a new frame as the client, but it's a lie)
Jan 02 18:33:07 <grym>	bpalmer: as long as i can open new GUI windows snappily, we good 
Jan 02 18:33:39 <bpalmer>	some people just alias emacs to be emacsclient -a "" 
Jan 02 18:33:54 <spudpnds>	Yup, I do that.
Jan 02 18:34:04 <grym>	bpalmer: i've more or less done that, but today's been a little wonky on the configuration hacking side 
Jan 02 18:42:53 <grym>	has emacsclient changed recently? `emacsclient -a ""` gives me `emacsclient: file name or argument required` and nothing else 
Jan 02 18:43:10 <grym>	but emacsclient --help still says that the emptystring will do what it used to 
Jan 02 18:43:36 <grym>	i'm using kelleyk emacs 26.3
Jan 02 18:44:00 <thblt>	You need to give it a filename or -c
Jan 02 18:46:48 <grym>	hmm.  ok, that gives connection refused and then the standard spiel about some GTK bug
Jan 02 18:47:00 <grym>	what's the emacsclient version of -q 
Jan 02 18:47:51 <grym>	i'm getting my normal "yasnippets loaded" message and then ... crickets 
Jan 02 18:48:02 <grym>	so i'm wondering what in my config might be being stupjid 
Jan 02 18:48:44 <thblt>	strictly speaking, there's none. emacsclient calls into a running instance.
Jan 02 18:54:35 <MoziM>	grym: you can launch emacs with a unique title like "EMACS-MAIN-FRAME", then search all processes for that unique title and grab the pid from it
Jan 02 18:55:25 <MoziM>	grym: after launching emacs and the emacsclient isn't already running, you can simply run (server-start)
Jan 02 19:19:43 <thblt>	I'm tempted to try reverting to package.el for most of my Emacs config, instead of Borg.
Jan 02 19:21:29 <thblt>	Straight looks uselessly complicated (for me)
Jan 02 19:22:52 <bandali>	in my experience, straight.el works pretty great if you invest some time and reads it (very long) readme
Jan 02 19:23:09 <bandali>	but i myself am switching over to letting guix manage my emacs packages
Jan 02 19:24:19 <thblt>	How does guix/nix manage package udpates, compared to eg Melpa? Does a human need to modify the derivation (or whatever it's called on Guix) for every git push?
Jan 02 19:24:56 <thblt>	Using Nix for the bulk of my packages and Borg for things I contribute to seems a good idea.
Jan 02 19:25:28 *	technomancy just uses (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/whatever") for packages he contributes to
Jan 02 19:27:29 <thblt>	Yeah, actually… :)
Jan 02 19:27:45 <bandali>	thblt, yeah; see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/log/gnu/packages/emacs-xyz.scm to get a feel
Jan 02 19:28:09 <bandali>	tho i think guix does have some mechanism for automatically fetching updates and bumping versions for a package
Jan 02 19:28:14 <bandali>	but i don’t remember what it’s called
Jan 02 19:31:46 <thblt>	Nix seems to somehow directly convert Melpa to Nix. 
Jan 02 19:32:20 <thblt>	But I don't understand how
Jan 02 19:33:05 <bandali>	ha
Jan 02 19:35:15 <thblt>	It creates a derivation from melpa/package-build, but not from melpa/melpa itself
Jan 02 19:39:59 <thblt>	I got it.  It's roughly the same as the Guix process, there's a script that generates nix derivations from Melpa recipes.
Jan 02 19:43:34 <thblt>	And it seems to be updated whenever someone decides to update it :)
Jan 02 19:56:24 <boeg>	Anyone have an idea as to why if I launch emacs in gnome (wayland) it sharp and pretty, but if I launch it in sway (wayland) it's blurry as if in sway, it's launched without wayland support or something?
Jan 02 19:56:56 <thblt>	boeg: on a laptop with a hidpi display?
Jan 02 19:57:06 <boeg>	thblt: yes
Jan 02 19:57:17 <technomancy>	boeg: sometimes that's due to missing font config; like in X if you run an .xsession that doesn't honor .Xdefaults
Jan 02 19:57:19 <boeg>	on the same machine
Jan 02 19:57:29 <technomancy>	I don't know what the wayland equivalent to .Xdefaults is tho
Jan 02 19:57:34 <boeg>	hmm okay
Jan 02 19:57:56 <thblt>	boeg: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/2966
Jan 02 19:59:13 <boeg>	thblt: ah interesting
Jan 02 20:01:35 <boeg>	so gnome is doing something to get emacs to work properly i guess
Jan 02 20:07:47 <aidalgol>	AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jan 02 20:08:03 <bremner>	tell us what you really think
Jan 02 20:08:06 <aidalgol>	Today is a day that makes me hate technology.
Jan 02 20:08:21 <aidalgol>	I woke up to my router having shat itself.
Jan 02 20:08:30 <aidalgol>	In software, not hardware, thankfully
Jan 02 20:08:48 <aidalgol>	But there was no reason for it, and I had to factory reset the damn thing.

Jan 02 20:09:16 <bandali>	lol
Jan 02 20:09:23 <bpalmer>	rudybot: nature, uh, finds a way.
Jan 02 20:09:24 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I am afraid that scientists do not exist in a vacuum, and science fields and faculties can exhibit a pretty strong gender bias (good intro http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/29/op-ed-the-still-tolerated-gender-bias-in-science/ and http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/04/discrimination-starts-even-before-grad-school-study-finds.html).
Jan 02 20:09:37 <bpalmer>	wow, astronaut slam out of nowhere.
Jan 02 20:09:46 <aidalgol>	I have no idea what happened, so I am going with cosmic rays and getting on with my life.
Jan 02 20:09:54 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some of them are pretty good scientists, you know. 
Jan 02 20:10:02 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Them scientists are pretty mean anyhow. Always with this predicting and stuff.
Jan 02 20:10:15 <bandali>	shitty buggy software is probably what happened
Jan 02 20:10:44 <parsnip>	astronaut slam sounds very painful
Jan 02 20:10:59 <parsnip>	that would really knock the air out of you
Jan 02 20:11:22 <aidalgol>	bandali: It's running OpenWRT, and hasn't failed me for years.
Jan 02 20:15:17 <bandali>	aidalgol, ah! i (somewhat) take that back then :p
Jan 02 20:15:30 <bandali>	i assumed it were running some shitty proprietary stack
Jan 02 20:15:39 <bandali>	(like my parents’ router -_-)

Jan 02 20:30:14 <bpalmer>	Let's put a man in the moon.
Jan 02 20:32:28 <thblt>	Which one?
Jan 02 20:32:41 <johnjay>	super man
Jan 02 20:33:02 <johnjay>	not the one who was born in the soviet union. the american one
Jan 02 20:33:12 <spudpnds>	The Orange one who won't be named?
Jan 02 20:34:20 <parsnip>	Andrew Man
Jan 02 20:34:37 <parsnip>	german superman?
Jan 02 20:34:50 <parsnip>	rudybot: where is twb when you need him?
Jan 02 20:34:52 <rudybot>	parsnip: where is twb when we need him?
Jan 02 20:35:15 <parsnip>	rudybot: donut correct me
Jan 02 20:35:17 <rudybot>	parsnip: I've hard tales of starting Emacs and going and having a cup of coffee and a donut
Jan 02 20:35:33 <parsnip>	rudybot: probably an aeropress
Jan 02 20:35:33 <rudybot>	parsnip: hm, probably i've picked a wrong word. what's that aeropress thing?
Jan 02 20:38:03 <hodapp>	rudybot: your competition, that's what.
Jan 02 20:38:08 <rudybot>	hodapp: does anyone understand what kind of tests the editors were put through in this competition ? http://www.rackspace.com/blog/text-editor-madness-bracket-vote-for-your-favorite/
Jan 02 20:41:34 <boeg>	Anyone know how to get leading stars to be hidden when using org-bullets with org-mode in terminal emacs? Works in GUI but in terminal they have a light grey background
Jan 02 20:45:45 <grym>	no no, which moon 
Jan 02 20:52:07 <bpalmer>	one that's not a space station
Jan 02 20:55:20 <grym>	phobos it is, but don't bring the rock; he'll try to gakk all your scientists
Jan 02 20:55:34 <grym>	doom was such a good good/bad movie 
Jan 02 20:57:32 <bpalmer>	apparently there's a Doom: Annihilation movie now
Jan 02 20:58:00 <spudpnds>	boeg: Let me know if you find out, I have the same problem.
Jan 02 20:59:16 <spudpnds>	https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/issues/16
Jan 02 21:14:02 <boeg>	spudpnds: yes, doesn't seem to be a fix for it 
Jan 02 21:15:01 <boeg>	spudpnds: other than figuring out how spacemacs does it
Jan 02 21:16:10 <spudpnds>	yeah, frustrating.
Jan 02 21:18:27 <spudpnds>	I think a decent solution would be to turn off org-bullets when you're in a TTY frame, and turn it on for GUI frames.
Jan 02 21:24:30 <spudpnds>	boeg: https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets
Jan 02 21:25:24 <spudpnds>	Might be worth uninstalling the MELPA org-bullets and manually installing this one, as org-bullets is essentially unmaintained.
Jan 02 21:26:19 <johnjay>	is there an emacs speedbar like mode for navigating in a file?
Jan 02 21:26:28 <johnjay>	the default register keys take a lot of effort to press
Jan 02 21:26:30 <boeg>	but isn't it just the same thing, spudpnds ?
Jan 02 21:26:59 <dale>	johnjay: I think speedbar itself can kind of do it, but I like https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list.
Jan 02 21:28:08 <spudpnds>	boeg: mmm, it seems to have a bunch of commits from tarsius.
Jan 02 21:28:17 <boeg>	spudpnds: ah ok
Jan 02 21:28:48 <boeg>	spudpnds: how do you install it from there? Just download it an load it manually and is there a better way?
Jan 02 21:29:04 <johnjay>	dale: when i click on the file in speedbar it shows some categories i guess it defined?
Jan 02 21:29:12 <johnjay>	i just want to navigate to line XYZ fast with a mouse click
Jan 02 21:29:14 <dale>	johnjay: Could be from imenu?
Jan 02 21:29:57 <johnjay>	sorry what?
Jan 02 21:30:03 <johnjay>	i'm looking at speedbar default
Jan 02 21:30:10 <spudpnds>	boeg: The old fashioned way, copy org-bullets.el somewhere on your load-path. For me I have ~/.emacs.d/lisp in my load path.
Jan 02 21:30:16 <dale>	johnjay: The "categories" could be from imenu.
Jan 02 21:30:25 <dale>	johnjay: I really don't remember, I don't use speedbar.
Jan 02 21:30:36 <boeg>	spudpnds: right, ok
Jan 02 21:30:40 <johnjay>	ah ok. well either way i don't want a list of classes and variables
Jan 02 21:30:46 <johnjay>	just list of file locations to click on
Jan 02 21:30:56 <johnjay>	sort of like boomark list i guess
Jan 02 21:30:59 <johnjay>	but for mouse action
Jan 02 21:31:18 *	johnjay wishes he'd done that minimap for emacs idea
Jan 02 21:31:40 <johnjay>	instead of using M-< with a prefix you just click on a square to scroll to X% through the buffer
Jan 02 21:31:56 <spudpnds>	boeg: argh, it looks like that particular "stars invisible" PR is only available on specific branch?
Jan 02 21:31:58 <dale>	What about... the scroll bars?
Jan 02 21:31:59 <spudpnds>	Trying to figure it out now.
Jan 02 21:32:01 <slondr>	johnjay: You mean like VSCode and IntelliJ have?
Jan 02 21:32:06 <slondr>	Isn't there an emacs plugin for that?
Jan 02 21:32:13 <johnjay>	not sure, haven't used VScode. i'll just use occur mode for now
Jan 02 21:32:25 <boeg>	spudpnds: ah, right
Jan 02 21:32:26 <johnjay>	it's not pretty but lets you mouse click list of things
Jan 02 21:32:40 <johnjay>	you have to use regexp to define it though
Jan 02 21:32:42 <dale>	johnjay: There's also minimap and sublimity.
Jan 02 21:32:53 <dale>	(Neither of which I've ever tried.)
Jan 02 21:33:06 <boeg>	spudpnds: should I just use "load-library"  to load the file? Is that the proper way? 
Jan 02 21:33:30 <johnjay>	dale: the minimap package is so close to being what I'd like
Jan 02 21:33:38 <johnjay>	the problem is the "minimap" scrolls. which kinda defeats the purpose
Jan 02 21:33:47 <spudpnds>	boeg: (require 'org-bullets) 
Jan 02 21:34:06 <johnjay>	it also takes up too much screen space. need a way to display a small window or taskbar at the bottom of emacs imo
Jan 02 21:34:10 <johnjay>	but i'm not sure how to do that
Jan 02 21:34:24 <mphojele>	johnjay: i think you are imagining the swoop package having click-able results.
Jan 02 21:34:25 <johnjay>	probably easier just to have a small window with images in it...?
Jan 02 21:34:30 <boeg>	spudpnds: alright
Jan 02 21:35:35 <zeta_0>	in order to shorten bash's path, in this code i changed all the lowercase w's to uppercase W's, and it seems to be working correctly the only issue is i think the `/` is supposed to be inserted before the directory, how would i fix this? https://hastebin.com/yutefiqada.bash
Jan 02 21:36:05 <zeta_0>	[zeta@nixos:nix-haskell-recipes]$ pwd
Jan 02 21:36:46 <zeta_0>	it works but i think it needs `/` here:
Jan 02 21:36:48 <spudpnds>	beog: Sorry, I led you astray, that patch never made it into the the emacsorphanage version.
Jan 02 21:36:53 <zeta_0>	[zeta@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]$
Jan 02 21:37:52 <zeta_0>	not sure if you guys know bash well or not, but i figured i'd ask this question here
Jan 02 21:38:56 <spudpnds>	beog: I'm going to try to apply this patch https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/pull/21 to the original version and see if I can make it work for me.
Jan 02 21:39:20 <johnjay>	mphojele: ah ok so this swoop thing is like occur i guess?
Jan 02 21:39:46 <boeg>	spudpnds: good luck, think i'm gonna try too
Jan 02 21:40:18 <spudpnds>	boeg: TIL: you can turn a PR into a patch just by adding ".patch" to the end of the URL, i.e: https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/pull/21.patch
Jan 02 21:40:27 <boeg>	ah cool
Jan 02 21:41:25 <mphojele>	johnjay: and has that little window you asking for; you select and it moves out of your way
Jan 02 21:42:02 <johnjay>	mphojele: little window? you mean the list of search matches itself?
Jan 02 21:44:00 <zeta_0>	lisp is much easier to understand than bash, for me at least
Jan 02 21:44:02 <mphojele>	johnjay: Yes, and it shows up below the buffer you are editing, has commands to scroll and select your line, after you do that, it's gone
Jan 02 21:46:56 <boeg>	spudpnds: seems to work
Jan 02 21:47:20 <mphojele>	zeta_0: try not quoting the dollar sign; it's special in a prompt in that \$ would either result in # for root or $ for any user
Jan 02 21:49:40 <zeta_0>	mphojele: i am not sure what you mean? could you paste what piece of code to change?
Jan 02 21:50:11 <protons_>	does anyone know of a better solution to resizing windows in emacs besides stock
Jan 02 21:50:33 <spudpnds>	boeg: nice!
Jan 02 21:50:35 <boeg>	spudpnds: someone should fork it and apply the match
Jan 02 21:50:44 <boeg>	;)
Jan 02 21:50:52 <boeg>	patch*
Jan 02 21:51:02 <cvandusen>	No, you had it right the first time.
Jan 02 21:51:21 <boeg>	:)
Jan 02 21:52:28 <cvandusen>	rudybot: Def Leppard references are not welcome 
Jan 02 21:52:30 <rudybot>	cvandusen: The drummer from Def Leppard only had one.
Jan 02 21:52:35 <zeta_0>	everything is working great, i just need `/` to be placed before the current working directory like this? [zeta@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]$   [root@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]#
Jan 02 21:53:20 <mphojele>	zeta_0: Sorry, I just ran straight to your code before understanding your question
Jan 02 21:53:50 <neuro_sys>	General question about hooks. I'd like to disable all themes when ediff-mode is on, and re-enable them when the mode exits. Can anyone help me make this better than this? https://gist.github.com/neuro-sys/c0964bbc6eef32a0116b906cdfd4b708
Jan 02 21:54:11 <zeta_0>	here is the code: https://hastebin.com/yutefiqada.bash
Jan 02 21:54:14 <zeta_0>	mphojele: ^
Jan 02 21:54:52 <dale>	zeta_0: Why do you need a / enclosed backticks in your prompt?
Jan 02 21:56:02 <dale>	neuro_sys: This seems like something likely to break, but one idea is to actually use a buffer-local kill-buffer-hook in your ediff-mode buffers that does something like only turning the themes back on iff the buffer about to be killed is the last ediff-mode buffer.
Jan 02 21:56:35 <zeta_0>	dale: i just want / to be before the current working directory like it was before, after i changed all the lowercase w's to uppercase W's it shortened bash's path like i want but the inserted / went away?
Jan 02 21:56:36 <dale>	neuro_sys: And then ediff-mode-hook needs to not clobber the value of ediff-theme-temporary.  In both of my statements I am thinking about the case that there is >1 simultaneous ediff-mode buffer, which seems highly plausible.
Jan 02 21:57:28 <dale>	zeta_0: So if you're in directory /foo/bar/baz, you want your prompt to read "/baz"?
Jan 02 21:58:02 <neuro_sys>	dale: Thanks, I'll read on buffer-local and kill-buffer-hook.
Jan 02 21:58:04 <zeta_0>	dale: exactly
Jan 02 21:58:53 <dale>	zeta_0: I believe you can just put a literal / before \W.
Jan 02 22:00:13 <zeta_0>	dale: ok, i'll try that out
Jan 02 22:04:26 <zeta_0>	dale: it worked, thanks, it was annoying having a long bash path, so i am glad that i was able to shorten it
Jan 02 22:06:27 <neuro_sys>	dale: Works perfectly now! Could you have a look if any more things to fix? https://gist.github.com/neuro-sys/c0964bbc6eef32a0116b906cdfd4b708
Jan 02 22:12:55 <zeta_0>	dale: it works, the bash's path is shortened, but when i enter a nix-shell it does not inherit the bash settings so the path stays long?
Jan 02 22:13:24 <golluq>	Hi! I wonder if there is a way to start new files with different templates depending on file extention. E.g if I create/open a new file.pl there is already some lines I would like it to have, and other lines for other file endings? Could you point me to right direction for this?
Jan 02 22:14:35 <golluq>	*extension
Jan 02 22:15:20 <parsnip>	google tells me, "auto-insert.el"
Jan 02 22:15:36 <golluq>	Think I found something online regarding template.el, will check it up. seems to be what I look for
Jan 02 22:16:52 <parsnip>	might be based on major-mode, since you usually already have that set up per file extension
Jan 02 22:16:57 <phattycakes>	golluq: yasnippet can do this but auto-insert is super easy to setup and learn.
Jan 02 22:17:37 <golluq>	great, will check those up. I

Jan 02 22:21:38 <parsnip>	JordiGH: done
Jan 02 22:21:45 <JordiGH>	Thanks!
Jan 02 22:22:16 <parsnip>	we should just but contents of ,,spook,, in all subject lines
Jan 02 22:22:16 <fsbot>	ErcSpook: at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcSpook
Jan 02 22:25:15 <JordiGH>	I think the spook file needs some serious updates.
Jan 02 22:25:30 <JordiGH>	Doesn't it include stuff about the Iran/Contra affair?
Jan 02 22:25:36 <bremner>	Yay, JordiGH is the Gnu new project leader
Jan 02 22:25:42 <bremner>	you heard it here first.
Jan 02 22:25:49 <bremner>	and probably last
Jan 02 22:25:54 <ggoes>	JordiGH: yeah, a lot of stuff like that.
Jan 02 22:26:47 <parsnip>	are data "outlets" /actually/ asymmetrical? can you provide a data plan via these ports?
Jan 02 22:27:15 <Sketch>	bremner: does that mean we have to start calling him jgh?
Jan 02 22:27:22 <parsnip>	i couldn't tell if the word "outlet" was right, since you sometimes upload data. but i guess you don't provide a service plan back up the other way.
Jan 02 22:28:30 <JordiGH>	bremner: Man, that's *two* people that have told me to be head Gnu, haha.
Jan 02 22:30:52 <bremner>	JordiGH: does the other one live with you?
Jan 02 22:31:31 <bremner>	Sketch: or just stick with "jfc"
Jan 02 22:34:56 <JordiGH>	bremner: No, but the other one does hang out in Mastodon too.
Jan 02 22:35:47 <technomancy>	allow me to interject for a moment; what you're referring to as Mastodon is actually one part of a larger social networking system...
Jan 02 22:36:20 <johnjay>	The Federation of Planets?
Jan 02 22:36:21 <Sketch>	,mastodon-bore
Jan 02 22:36:21 <fsbot>	Chess tonight.
Jan 02 22:36:37 <technomancy>	johnjay: close enough
Jan 02 22:37:05 <Sketch>	if only they would unite
Jan 02 22:37:33 <slondr>	When will Mastodon federate with Matrix
Jan 02 22:37:45 <technomancy>	Sketch: CW: spoilers for ENT S04
Jan 02 22:37:48 <slondr>	to create the One True Federation
Jan 02 22:38:12 <technomancy>	slondr: I think that's actually kinda possible?
Jan 02 22:38:19 <technomancy>	thru some weird intermediary
Jan 02 22:38:32 <Sketch>	mastodon-to-irc-to-matrix?
Jan 02 22:38:55 <slondr>	Does Mastodon have an IRC bridge?
Jan 02 22:38:57 <JordiGH>	technomancy: In this case, it really is Mastodon.
Jan 02 22:39:12 <technomancy>	matrix to hubzilla to activitypub or something
Jan 02 22:39:43 <slondr>	I know that GNU Social can't talk to anything in the Fediverse anymore
Jan 02 22:40:00 <technomancy>	slondr: no, it can talk to pleroma still
Jan 02 22:40:03 <Sketch>	there is a bitlbee plugin for mastodon, so you could probably have a bot sit in between the two
Jan 02 22:41:30 <Lordveda>	Does anyone here use anaconda-mode for python dev?
Jan 02 22:41:37 <slondr>	Wait I think there's an XMPP host for Mastodon
Jan 02 22:41:59 <slondr>	XMPP has a Matrix bridge
Jan 02 22:42:15 <hodapp>	fun fact: JordiGH's middle name is actually "GNU"

When I `M-x describe-face` I'm told that it is the `default` face. But that can't be true. Does anyone know what this face is actually called?

Jan 02 22:54:03 <golluq>	bpalmer: thnx
Jan 02 22:54:42 <jaafar>	Instead of a list of potential matches supplied by Google, I get just my exact input string with "Search for 'my pattern here' on Google"
Jan 02 22:55:03 <jaafar>	which kind of obviates the point of using Emacs-based narrowing
Jan 02 22:55:28 <jaafar>	It's plainly not supposed to work that way based on tuhdo's tutorial
Jan 02 22:58:34 <cvandusen>	How have we not shortened "tutorial" to "tuto" by now? 
Jan 02 22:59:08 <JordiGH>	tuts, no?
Jan 02 23:00:03 <cvandusen>	That rhymes with "toots"?
Jan 02 23:01:20 <golluq>	bpalmer: I need to do something like Save for future sessions. How do I do that. I could toggle to "in use" with enter. Emacs say "to install your edits, invoce [state]" 
Jan 02 23:01:39 <golluq>	*invoke
Jan 02 23:02:07 <bpalmer>	hit RET when the point is on "Apply and Save"

Jan 22 10:42:31 <montaropdf>	What could prevent ERC from auto identify my user with NickServ?
Jan 22 10:42:53 <montaropdf>	I hve an entry in .authinfo

Jan 22 10:43:55 <montaropdf>	I have configured ERC according to the doc and https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8ml6na/tip_how_to_make_erc_fun_to_use/
Jan 22 10:44:19 <montaropdf>	So I don't really understand where could be the problem :/
Jan 22 11:07:48 <montaropdf>	My configuration: https://github.com/montaropdf/reve-emacs-config
Jan 22 11:44:34 <blandest`>	montaropdf: (setq erc-nickserv-passwords '((freenode (("montaropdf" . "<password>")))))
Jan 22 11:45:08 <blandest`>	you seem to be lacking this in your config but you have set (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password nil) so you don't get prompted for the password
Jan 22 11:45:36 <blandest`>	you could also try to  (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password t) if you don't want to store your password in your init file :)
Jan 22 11:46:15 <montaropdf>	blandest: shouldn't ERC read the password from the .authinfo file?
Jan 22 11:48:35 <blandest`>	montaropdf: yes, but I am not sure if it also sends that password to NickServ.
Jan 22 11:49:16 <montaropdf>	ok, then I will try with (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password t)
Jan 22 11:49:26 <montaropdf>	thanks

Jan 22 12:20:03 <wasamasa>	the original one by RMS, one on an emacs-style editor and how they made a semantic major mode for it and one giving a historical overview by the former emacs maintainer
Jan 22 12:20:20 <wasamasa>	there's maybe more by people using org-mode

Jan 22 13:33:36 <ecbrown>	kaiwkx: my erc disconnects frequently, especially if i do an intensive operation in the same emacs session, e.g. threading a large gnus group
Jan 22 13:33:52 <ecbrown>	whether it reconnects is a crapshoot
Jan 22 13:36:12 <kaiwkx>	ecbrown: i guess i missed a lot of fun discussion because of it
Jan 22 13:37:09 <ecbrown>	hah, yeah, it used to bother me so much that i ran it in a different emacs session... but then i realized that i'm probably not missing much :-)
Jan 22 13:39:28 <ecbrown>	probably bigger deal is losing remote REPLs and the like
Jan 22 13:43:58 <kaiwkx>	another annoying thing is, when it reconnecting, it will re-display the irc topics and users
Jan 22 13:47:27 <kaiwkx>	dont know if there is any way to prevent it
Jan 22 13:48:56 <ecbrown>	i'd settle for performance being halved if emacs didn't lock up
Jan 22 13:49:37 <ecbrown>	contemplating a loop construct that is friendly toward multitasking, just so network connections aren't lost
Jan 22 13:58:31 <ecbrown>	oh well, it's everywhere, magit, gnus, operations on large buffers... the only solution that works for me is to run multiple emacs instances and communicate through files 
Jan 22 14:04:49 <kaiwkx>	ecbrown: have to agree...
Jan 22 14:12:45 <kensanata>	ouch
Jan 22 14:13:19 <kensanata>	I wonder whether there is a way to increase the timeout for all your network connections
Jan 22 14:13:35 <ecbrown>	it may be e.g. freenode that is dropping
Jan 22 14:14:42 <ecbrown>	ssh has things like ClientAliveInterval and ServerAliveInterval
Jan 22 14:50:08 <mplsCorwin>	fsbot: later tell kaiwkx that we can ignore messages in ERC with erc-hide-list, e.g (setq erc-hide-list '("JOIN" "MODE" "NICK" "PART" "QUIT" )
Jan 22 14:50:08 <fsbot>	Try: m8b sicp-bait

Jan 22 14:59:47 <fsbot>	<rekor> i've recently started reading SICP. it's been tough, but i've at least seen a lucid flow of the material from section to section, until i reached the Orders of Growth section in chapter 1; it makes absolutely no sense and seems terribly explained to a novice programmer with no programming experience.

Feb 19 12:06:33 <twb>	https://www.gazelle.nl/media//gene-cms/d/e/derailleurversnelling-gazelle-cityzen-c8-hmb---ebike-2.jpg   why do you have an idler sproket on a hub gear
Feb 19 12:12:57 <fledermaus>	dunno, what's an idler thingy?
Feb 19 12:13:29 <twb>	on derailler drivetrains they have an extra sprocket, not connected to anything, on a spring to keep the chain tensioned
Feb 19 12:13:53 <twb>	THis is necessary in derailleur designs because the different driving sprockets are different diameters
Feb 19 12:14:03 <fledermaus>	gotcha.
Feb 19 12:14:17 <twb>	on a hub gear drivetrain, the sprocket is always the same, so you can avoid the idler/tensioner, and also can easily put the entire thing inside a chain case
Feb 19 12:14:37 <twb>	This keeps the chain clean of dirt which is the main thing that fucks up the chain and, in turn, the sprockets
Feb 19 12:14:48 <fledermaus>	hm.
Feb 19 12:15:07 <fledermaus>	is it possible it's a hybrid with a derailleur at the front and hub at the back?
Feb 19 12:15:08 <twb>	also, because the chain doesn't move side-to-side between sprockets, you can use a chain with no sideways bend, i.e. stronger
Feb 19 12:15:46 <twb>	fledermaus: I think most likely they just put it there because it's cheaper than convincing bike shops to stock hub-gear-appropriate chains, and to put chain tugs in
Feb 19 12:16:04 <twb>	And because they don't have a fully enclosed chain case
Feb 19 12:16:25 <twb>	rudybot: t8 en de bicycle chain
Feb 19 12:16:52 <rudybot>	twb: Fahrradkette
Feb 19 12:18:34 <twb>	OK so a repair link is about 2€ and a new chain is about 5€ for a hub chain or 30€ for a racing bike chain
Feb 19 12:19:25 <twb>	Plus like 30€ for labour I guess, for a 15 minute job if you've got the chain-breaking tool and bike stand already

Feb 19 12:32:52 <twb>	I'm pretty sure I'm still running the original chain from 2011
Feb 19 12:33:57 <twb>	yep according to my log it was last serviced in 2016 and that was a "quicklink" for $20 inc. parts and labour
Feb 19 12:34:47 <fledermaus>	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51499777
Feb 19 12:35:05 <modory>	twb: what 'chain'?
Feb 19 12:35:20 <twb>	modory: on my bicycle
Feb 19 12:35:37 <twb>	so I have a handwritten but not typed up list of the full TCO for this bike
Feb 19 12:39:30 <twb>	A$1900 in 2011-06-02.  Then A$1700 in misc parts and labour, plus another A$600 for a replacement gearbox + wheel rebuild back in 2016.
Feb 19 12:39:55 <twb>	So TCO for it's ~9-year-life so far is about A$4200

Feb 19 12:42:37 <montaropdf>	adgtl: you are welcome
Feb 19 12:42:53 <chrisb>	twb: shimano ultegra?
Feb 19 12:42:53 <twb>	chrisb: are you asking about the fairing?
Feb 19 12:43:12 <twb>	chrisb: no it's a shimano nexus 8 gearest
Feb 19 12:43:52 <twb>	ultegra sounds like a road gearset; this is an omafiet
Feb 19 12:43:56 <chrisb>	twb: the prices seem high, unless the parts are new and "performance"
Feb 19 12:43:59 <montaropdf>	adgtl: BTW, a bit of ad, here is my public Emacs config repo: https://github.com/montaropdf/reve-emacs-config
Feb 19 12:44:10 <montaropdf>	If you see anything useful taketh ;)
Feb 19 12:44:10 <adgtl>	cool
Feb 19 12:44:18 <twb>	chrisb: it's 0 labour from me
Feb 19 12:44:26 <adgtl>	yep.. will take a look and cherry pick things.
Feb 19 12:45:00 <montaropdf>	Hope this will help
Feb 19 12:45:01 <chrisb>	montaropdf: i am always looking to expand my .emacs cargo cult
Feb 19 12:45:01 <twb>	labour is probaly like A$70/hr or something
Feb 19 12:45:46 <montaropdf>	chrisb: ???
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fsbot>	Yes!
Feb 19 12:45:46 <twb>	My previous bike was a Kronan at A$1100 and it only lasted from 2008 to 2011
Feb 19 12:45:46 <chrisb>	,cargo-cult
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fsbot>	Go ahead, blindly copy and paste that code. What could possibly go wrong
Feb 19 12:45:46 <montaropdf>	lol
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fledermaus>	I've got a marin mill valley.
Feb 19 12:45:46 <twb>	THough I don't have records of the kronan's service history
Feb 19 12:45:58 <fledermaus>	Apart from the bottom bracket/crank it came with it's been a great bike.
Feb 19 12:46:51 <twb>	The only real problem I had with the tour populair is its read fender isn't strong enough, and its integrated lighting runs through that fender
Feb 19 12:47:42 <twb>	so when the fender stay breaks it tends to shear to rear dynamo light
Feb 19 12:47:42 <twb>	it's wiring i mean
Feb 19 12:47:43 <twb>	$bike dude fixed that by jerry-rigging stronger stays, sort of like what they do for demo derby cars
Feb 19 12:47:43 <fledermaus>	WIth LED light lifetimes is a dynamo light even worth it these days?
Feb 19 12:49:48 <chrisb>	my .mailcap sets application/pdf; pdftotext %s -; copiousoutput; but eww doesn't render the text, it prints out the pdftotext error message
Feb 19 12:51:13 <chrisb>	doc-view-pdftotext-program is set to pdftotext
Feb 19 12:51:22 <twb>	chrisb: according to my original notes I was aiming for 5y lifecycle and A$3000 TCO (= A$10/week)
Feb 19 12:52:03 <chrisb>	and doc-view-mode -c C-c renders pdf --> txt
Feb 19 12:52:04 <twb>	It's lasted ~9 years at A$9/week, including the new hub / wheel rebuild, which is the point where you tend to write off the entire bike
Feb 19 12:52:42 <chrisb>	twb: interesting...how does it work out it A$/mile cycled?
Feb 19 12:53:02 <twb>	A$0.14/km very roughly
Feb 19 12:53:21 <chrisb>	twb: so good
Feb 19 12:54:04 <twb>	Current TCO about A$9/week, if I had written it off in 2016 per original estimates, it would be A$14/week
Feb 19 12:55:10 <twb>	Hrm I think some of those numbers must be wrong
Feb 19 12:55:22 <twb>	No that's right.  it's dollars not cents.
Feb 19 12:58:59 <twb>	chrisb: http://ix.io/2c8d
Feb 19 12:59:14 <bremner>	oh. I was confused, I thought twb spend $3k on a computer
Feb 19 12:59:36 <twb>	bremner: no I normally spend about $350 on a computer which SHOULD be $200 but Australia Tax
Feb 19 13:00:15 <twb>	Although my last computer I got much better hardware for $1200 or something
Feb 19 13:00:47 <twb>	I still have't actually used that new laptop yet because ICBF switching
Feb 19 13:01:40 *	twb fucks off to get food and bed
Feb 19 13:06:20 <twb>	fledermaus: BTW I know you don't actually care, but mine is https://www.gazelle.nl/modellen/tour-populair with https://www.bumm.de/de/produkte/dynamo-scheinwerfer/parent/1786.html and Shimano Nexus 8 hub gear (haven't got it bookmarked)
Feb 19 13:07:19 <twb>	"Marin" appears to be a US make, which is like... what even?  They hate bicycles.
Feb 19 13:14:29 <mns>	For code completion, what is the better option,  company or auto-complete ?  Or some pointers to a cmoparison of the two.  For the moment my primary need is for Perl, Python, bash/sh, Groovy, Gradle, Maven, Ant, Make, Scheme, elisp, common lisp
Feb 19 13:16:48 <blandest>	mns: company
Feb 19 13:20:54 <montaropdf>	Which options/packages does Emacs propose to create files based on templates?
Feb 19 13:21:19 <mns>	montaropdf: yasnippet
Feb 19 13:21:20 <montaropdf>	I know of skeletor, but it is more for project creation than file creation from a template.
Feb 19 13:22:07 <montaropdf>	mns: To my knowledge,the file must be created already to use yasnippet, or there is some function I don't know about.
Feb 19 13:25:12 <mns>	montaropdf: I believe you can setup a key-binding that will run an elisp function in which you can use yasnippet programmatically.  yasnippet is the only templating package I know of.  If there are others, maybe they can be used in a similar fashion
Feb 19 13:26:38 <mns>	I am pretty sure that the JDEE package used to be able to create files, populated with certain basic imports for Java programming, etc.
Feb 19 13:26:38 <mns>	It was a simple key-chord and you had a new file
Feb 19 13:26:38 <montaropdf>	mns: so which function to use to tell yasnippet to use a particular template. I already look at it some times ago, without finding anything useful :/
Feb 19 13:27:36 <montaropdf>	Unfortunately I have to delay this discussion. I have a metting in a minute or so. See you later.
Feb 19 13:28:19 <mns>	montaropdf: you write your own function to do that.

Feb 19 14:01:22 <thblt>	Ignore the first attempt :)
Feb 19 14:02:01 <mns>	I always thought melpa and elpa were one and same lol.  
Feb 19 14:02:22 <mns>	I'll have to add elpa sources to my package list in that case.
Feb 19 14:02:23 <mns>	or should.

Feb 19 14:24:08 <praevalens>	I just started using eaf to have browser in emacs. There is nothing to open the url at a cursor in a buffer, so I'm trying to hack it myself. Problem is I've never really done elisp. I found that you can grab the url with thing-at-point. Now I'd like to patch the eaf-open-browser so it supplies thing-at-point as optional default parameter.I tried that but it didn't work: https://bpaste.net/J7BQ

Feb 28 21:55:24 <wasamasa>	are you volunteering to implement xpath properly?
Feb 28 21:58:22 <cvandusen>	rudybot: have you participated in the extensible games?
Feb 28 21:58:27 <rudybot>	cvandusen: I've never had one myself. I've just participated in the late-night revelry.
Feb 28 21:59:04 <cvandusen>	party hardy marty 
Feb 28 22:01:45 <Odin->	wasamasa: Isn't that one of those things that hardly anyone outside of Enterprise Software® touches?
Feb 28 22:01:58 <wasamasa>	you'd be surprised
Feb 28 22:02:06 <wasamasa>	xpath can do far better than css selectors
Feb 28 22:02:06 <bpalmer>	xpath is actually super-common.
Feb 28 22:02:14 <wasamasa>	I used to hate it
Feb 28 22:02:16 <bpalmer>	it's heavily used in javascript
Feb 28 22:02:33 <bpalmer>	now, xquery ...
Feb 28 22:02:38 <wasamasa>	in fact, lxml's implementation of css selectors compiles to xpath
Feb 28 22:02:55 <Odin->	wasamasa: Note that I wasn't trying to say "it's horrible and bad" by that.
Feb 28 22:03:04 <bpalmer>	ha, and XPointer ... I had forgotten about that.
Feb 28 22:03:21 <wasamasa>	Odin-: implementing it looks like a major pain, so I decided to ignore it
Feb 28 22:04:54 <Odin->	wasamasa: I think that's one of those things that causes some systems to become chiefly enterprise-y. People won't implement it out of interest or curiosity.
Feb 28 22:05:10 <wasamasa>	that didn't stop web standards
Feb 28 22:05:23 <wasamasa>	sure, keep believing it's a curiosity
Feb 28 22:05:40 <bpalmer>	basic, not-fully-compliant xpath isn't that hard to write, comparatively.
Feb 28 22:05:54 <bpalmer>	it's just parsing path expressions and attribute expressions.
Feb 28 22:06:05 <Odin->	wasamasa: 'a curiosity' is almost expressly what I'm saying it isn't.
Feb 28 22:06:19 <bpalmer>	sorry, given that you have a structured xml representation already.
Feb 28 22:06:23 <wasamasa>	"hardly anyone touches"
Feb 28 22:06:42 <Odin->	wasamasa: The 'outside of' clause to that is pretty significant.
Feb 28 22:06:52 <wasamasa>	what about browsers is enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:11 <wasamasa>	do you think userscripts are enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:23 <wasamasa>	are websites enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:41 <wasamasa>	look, I get it, you're trying to look edgy
Feb 28 22:07:54 <wasamasa>	it's bullshit, but I'll believe it
Feb 28 22:11:18 <Odin->	I say it because the only places I've seen specifically mention implementing it are various Java libraries and a couple of RDBMSs, both of which tend to be firmly linked to the "this code was written because of a contract and not because the programmer found the problem interesting" side of the fence.
Feb 28 22:11:30 <Odin->	Which, again, isn't actually a bad thing.
Feb 28 22:12:07 <python476>	bpalmer: X* star
Feb 28 22:12:09 <Odin->	I may well be ill informed, which is why I asked a question.
Feb 28 22:12:21 <wasamasa>	yeah, you might want to look at browsers
Feb 28 22:12:31 <wasamasa>	they've come a long way
Feb 28 22:12:32 <python476>	xpath, xpointer, xlink, xquery, xmi, exml
Feb 28 22:13:17 <bpalmer>	W3C recommendation doesn't mean a whole lot nowadays
Feb 28 22:13:33 <kenrestivo>	only google matters
Feb 28 22:13:35 <Odin->	wasamasa: Well, it's not exactly front and center in any web API documentation I've seen.
Feb 28 22:14:35 <Odin->	Huh.
Feb 28 22:14:52 <wasamasa>	anyway, here's the guide that made me reconsider things: https://genius.com/Mat-brown-xpath-is-actually-pretty-useful-once-it-stops-being-confusing-annotated
Feb 28 22:15:00 <kenrestivo>	rudybot:  c c "YOLO"
Feb 28 22:15:01 <rudybot>	kenrestivo: I got a working line in ielm with dolist: (dolist (x '("-c" "color.diff=false")) (add-to-list 'yolo x))
Feb 28 22:15:07 <Odin->	MDN docs on XPath explicitly say "there are no plans to improve support further".
Feb 28 22:15:12 <python476>	xmlschema, xxml, triplexml, xlisp <defun fact n=1><match n><with>n > 2</with><replace>n * <fact {{ n - 1 }}/></>
Feb 28 22:15:31 <wasamasa>	it still beats the support of the xpath thing on emacswiki
Feb 28 22:15:49 <wasamasa>	which is just enough to get twb's hopes up
Feb 28 22:16:14 <kenrestivo>	there's a clojure lib that does xpath-like selects on stuff. it's kinda useful
Feb 28 22:16:25 <Odin->	wasamasa: You still seem to conflate my initial comment with a belief that XPath is _bad_.
Feb 28 22:16:54 <wasamasa>	well, it's wrong
Feb 28 22:17:04 <wasamasa>	anything serious extracting stuff from documents uses xpath
Feb 28 22:17:16 <Odin->	Fair enough.
Feb 28 22:17:26 <wasamasa>	be it for downloading webcomics, scraping the web or just automating some website
Feb 28 22:17:30 <bpalmer>	from XML documents, that is.
Feb 28 22:17:45 <Odin->	Although my impression is also that XML documents are mostly an Enterprise® thing.
Feb 28 22:17:46 <bpalmer>	and something a lot like xpath for things a lot like xml
Feb 28 22:17:47 <wasamasa>	once the browser turned the html into a DOM, it doesn't matter
Feb 28 22:18:12 <wasamasa>	now, if I ever encounter tagsoup that libxml can't handle, I'll reconsider
Feb 28 22:18:37 <wasamasa>	go make my day with a valid epub breaking nov.el
Feb 28 22:20:49 <wasamasa>	speaking of which, I should push a new stable tag, assuming nothing broke by all the new features
Feb 28 22:21:17 <wasamasa>	I don't use it too much after all
Feb 28 22:22:12 <lesshaste>	what's the recommend way to use julia with emacs? Is there something that has REPL?
Feb 28 22:22:54 <bpalmer>	,julia
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	julia are [0/4] a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[1] Apparently like matlab, octave, R and stuff
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[2] at http://julialang.org/
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[3] details on the julia programming language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_%28programming_language%29
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[4] for Emacs support, see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Julia
Feb 28 22:23:44 <lesshaste>	is that the same as https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs ?
Feb 28 22:23:52 <lesshaste>	if so, it seems to be hardly developed
Feb 28 22:24:21 <wasamasa>	not everything needs a daily update
Feb 28 22:24:29 <lesshaste>	https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
Feb 28 22:24:35 <lesshaste>	true but that's one update ever it seems
Feb 28 22:24:47 <wasamasa>	it's kind of funny with your nick
Feb 28 22:24:52 <lesshaste>	:)
Feb 28 22:28:34 <lesshaste>	I have the julia major mode working
Feb 28 22:28:37 <lesshaste>	I want to get https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl to work
Feb 28 22:29:08 <lesshaste>	http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/h7pHDGphpT/ is my .emacs
Feb 28 22:29:24 <lesshaste>	but M-x doesn't show julia-repl. How do I get it to work?
Feb 28 22:30:10 <wasamasa>	lol
Feb 28 22:30:20 <lesshaste>	what have I done wrong?
Feb 28 22:30:21 <wasamasa>	you have copied over the readme code as is
Feb 28 22:30:38 <wasamasa>	if you copy code saying path-to-something, you better replace it with a path to that thing
Feb 28 22:30:41 <lesshaste>	yep :)
Feb 28 22:30:51 <lesshaste>	let me fix that
Feb 28 22:30:57 <wasamasa>	anyway, that kind of stuff is not needed if you've installed it via package.el
Feb 28 22:31:09 <wasamasa>	package.el will set up load-path for you
Feb 28 22:31:18 <lesshaste>	wasamasa,  ok how do I do that?
Feb 28 22:31:41 <lesshaste>	I am using emacs 25 and julia major mode is working.. now... ?
Feb 28 22:31:43 <wasamasa>	same way you installed julia-mode
Feb 28 22:31:57 <lesshaste>	wasamasa, that was quite long and complicated and someone helped  me
Feb 28 22:32:07 <lesshaste>	I think it was via melpa
Feb 28 22:32:39 <wasamasa>	generally, do not place code requiring packages to be loaded up before package-initialize
Feb 28 22:32:50 <wasamasa>	that will not work unless you know what you're doing
Feb 28 22:33:24 <lesshaste>	M-x list-packages doesn't show any julia things
Feb 28 22:33:40 <wasamasa>	yeah, that's what they all say until they learn to search the list properly
Feb 28 22:33:48 <cvandusen>	What package archives do you have defined?
Feb 28 22:33:51 <wasamasa>	and then discover it's been installed already
Feb 28 22:34:14 <wasamasa>	or that their init file has errored out and package-archives is therefore not customized
Feb 28 22:34:16 <lesshaste>	cvandusen, I am not sure.. 
Feb 28 22:34:29 <wasamasa>	how one does that is a mystery to me, probably selective blindness
Feb 28 22:34:50 <lesshaste>	any help for how to get to stage 1 much appreciated
Feb 28 22:35:08 <wasamasa>	fix your init file first, then check the package list carefully
Feb 28 22:35:24 <lesshaste>	my .emacs is http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/t5w8sQBKbY/
Feb 28 22:35:30 <lesshaste>	is that OK?
Feb 28 22:35:40 <wasamasa>	<wasamasa> generally, do not place code requiring packages to be loaded up before package-initialize
Feb 28 22:35:59 <wasamasa>	the very first line is such code
Feb 28 22:36:15 <lesshaste>	and the (require 'package) line too?
Feb 28 22:36:15 <wasamasa>	unless you install emacs packages via apt, then nobody but twb can help you
Feb 28 22:36:17 <wasamasa>	no
Feb 28 22:36:29 <lesshaste>	ok so I will move the first line to the end?
Feb 28 22:36:37 <wasamasa>	try to get at least a cursory understanding of what the code does
Feb 28 22:37:41 <lesshaste>	 julia-mode         20191225.858  installed
Feb 28 22:37:46 <wasamasa>	see
Feb 28 22:37:51 <wasamasa>	it is there after all
Feb 28 22:37:58 <lesshaste>	I was looking for julia-repl
Feb 28 22:38:04 <lesshaste>	which is a minor mode apparently
Feb 28 22:38:07 <wasamasa>	I'm sure you'll find it eventually
Feb 28 22:38:12 <lesshaste>	it's not there :)
Feb 28 22:38:20 <wasamasa>	after all it has a melpa badge
Feb 28 22:38:21 <lesshaste>	unless ctrl-s isn't working
Feb 28 22:38:35 <lesshaste>	 elpy               1.22.0        installed
Feb 28 22:38:36 <wasamasa>	you may need to hit it again to wrap around
Feb 28 22:39:09 <lesshaste>	absent
Feb 28 22:39:39 <lesshaste>	do you see it?
Feb 28 22:39:55 <wasamasa>	I don't use melpa directly
Feb 28 22:40:01 <lesshaste>	ah ok
Feb 28 22:40:43 <wasamasa>	https://melpa.org/packages/archive-contents
Feb 28 22:40:56 <wasamasa>	it is in that list
Feb 28 22:41:11 <wasamasa>	so once your emacs fetched that list successfully, it will appear for you
Feb 28 22:42:01 <wasamasa>	hit r for to refetch it
Feb 28 22:43:24 <lesshaste>	I am going to give up for now but thanks for the help. I just want to write some julia code and can find another way to do it
Feb 28 22:43:39 <wasamasa>	like running a repl from M-x shell?
Feb 28 22:43:48 <lesshaste>	(I hit r from the list-packages screen but it didn't do much)
Feb 28 22:44:07 <wasamasa>	also, check your local copy of that file
Feb 28 22:44:19 <lesshaste>	local copy of which file?
Feb 28 22:44:32 <wasamasa>	~/.emacs.d/elpa/archives/melpa/archive-contents
Feb 28 22:45:58 <lesshaste>	hmm.. that does have more julia stuff in it
Feb 28 22:46:15 <lesshaste>	curious I didn't see it from emacs. Maybe it hadn't loaded the elpa packages at all to list?
Feb 28 22:46:26 <lesshaste>	was I maybe looking at some default non-elpa list?
Feb 28 22:46:46 <wasamasa>	start a new emacs instance and try again
Feb 28 22:47:06 <wasamasa>	honestly, most of the time it's people not searching properly or ignoring some blatant error message from their init file
Feb 28 22:47:36 <lesshaste>	there may well be an error message. Are they logged somewhere?
Feb 28 22:48:20 <wasamasa>	there's a messages buffer
Feb 28 22:48:25 <wasamasa>	errors pop up into a window
Feb 28 22:48:32 <wasamasa>	especially the init file kind
Feb 28 22:48:54 <lesshaste>	no errors in the messages buffer
Feb 28 22:48:59 <lesshaste>	ok now I do have to go. Thanks again
Feb 28 22:49:03 <lesshaste>	I'll try again another day
Feb 28 22:49:18 <cvandusen>	,delayed-next 
Feb 28 22:49:20 <fsbot>	If We sent down the angels and caused the dead to speak with them, and ranged all things before them, they would still not believe, Unless EMACS willed it.  But most of them are ignorant men.

Feb 29 15:35:42 <mekeor>	hello. can i somehow start an irc-client on my server and then connect to it with my emacs from my laptop or so? so that i'd have the logs and i'm always logged in…?
Feb 29 15:44:23 <illili>	mekeor: you could emacsclient into a running server via ssh
Feb 29 15:46:36 <mekeor>	thanks and goodbye, illili
Feb 29 16:01:34 <kleisli>	anyone know the best way to bind a key to a keymap (for example if I wanted M-h to have the same behavior as C-h)?

Feb 29 16:10:26 <assemblyPL_>	sorry for typo
Feb 29 16:11:32 <assemblyPL_>	I will rephrase my question
Feb 29 16:13:08 <assemblyPL_>	How to have Emacs not interpret sent Ctrl keysa
Feb 29 16:13:49 <assemblyPL_>	How to have Emacs not interpret sent Ctrl keys as commands to itself without changing what key sends what key.
Feb 29 16:14:01 <assemblyPL_>	Is this possible?
Feb 29 16:14:18 <wasamasa>	you forgot to mention that this is about exwm ultimately
Feb 29 16:16:03 <assemblyPL_>	without disabling the C-x functionality
Feb 29 16:16:42 <assemblyPL_>	no, ultimately it is about Emacs <--> any other program compatibility. 
Feb 29 16:48:27 <grym>	assemblyPL_: rebind your keyboard's winkey to another control 
Feb 29 16:49:03 <grym>	i don't know how to do that per-application or even if it's possible

Feb 29 17:14:09 <Illya>	How do I prevent tramp from completely locking up my emacs when changing networks? When a server disappears it retries to connect infintely, completely locking up interaction entirely. (C-g spam kills the process eventually but then it restarts)
Feb 29 17:37:21 <JohanP>	magit is missing a bunch of files in the unstaged changes section (shows up with git status). what could be the reason for this?
Feb 29 17:41:43 <mplsCorwin>	JohanP: did you already try refreshing the magit status buffer with "g" ?
Feb 29 17:47:36 <JohanP>	yes many times
Feb 29 17:47:55 <JohanP>	also tried restarting emacs 
Feb 29 17:49:14 <mplsCorwin>	Sorry JohanP :(  I wish I had something more helpful to suggest.  Am at the "enough to be dangerous" level with git
Feb 29 17:49:35 <JohanP>	mplsCorwin: ok, thanks anyways
Feb 29 17:49:42 <offby1>	JohanP: might they be "collapsed"?  magit lets you hide stuff by hitting TAB on the header line

Feb 29 17:51:39 <JohanP>	i suspected some interference from gerrit.el, but i have disabled that now
Feb 29 17:51:40 <offby1>	you're _sure_ magit is looking at the same git work tree that you are, when you run git on the command line?
Feb 29 17:52:21 <offby1>	is your "git" command perhaps aliased to something weird?
Feb 29 17:52:46 <JohanP>	offby1: i am 100% sure it's the same worktree
Feb 29 17:53:23 <JohanP>	and i know some unstaged files are missing, bc i just edited them
Feb 29 17:54:41 <shrysr>	using pyenv - is it possible to have a set virtualenv for a buffer / project?
Feb 29 17:57:06 <shrysr>	mebbe what I mean is use multiple active python env, without a manual activate.
Feb 29 17:58:40 <shrysr>	hmm docs indicate pyenv support per project python versions. rtfm .. leemmeee dive.

Feb 29 18:53:19 <rgr_>	current prefix arg is 4 for both.
Feb 29 18:56:50 <edgar-rft>	rgr_: look at the digit-argument and universal-argument functions in simple.el to see the difference

Feb 29 19:11:41 <wasamasa>	C-u sets the prefix argument to something that can be interpreted as 4 or as a single hit of the C-u key
Feb 29 19:11:48 <wasamasa>	whereas with C-4 only the former is possible
Feb 29 19:17:25 <rgr_>	and how do I tell the difference in code between C-u and C-4 being pressed prior to invoking a fn?
Feb 29 19:18:01 <rgr_>	I must admit I have a terrible mental block with prefix stuff. It seems kind of a hacked mess but thats just me not getting it I guess.
Feb 29 19:32:09 <wasamasa>	you look at the raw prefix value
Feb 29 19:32:20 <wasamasa>	if you've ever used (interactive "P"), it puts it there for you

Mar 02 12:41:35 <wasamasa>	,tias
Mar 02 12:41:36 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Mar 02 12:41:47 <wasamasa>	the manual has other pages than that
Mar 02 12:41:50 <wasamasa>	look at them
Mar 02 12:41:53 <afidegnum>	no it works for only a single org project and folder
Mar 02 12:42:02 <afidegnum>	but i have multiple projecs scattered
Mar 02 12:43:30 <afidegnum>	and i want to have multiple themes for them
Mar 02 12:44:22 <wasamasa>	it's an alist, so you can have more than one entry
Mar 02 12:44:35 <wasamasa>	how do you change the theme anyway?
Mar 02 12:45:30 <afidegnum>	i think i had to insert +HEAD:
Mar 02 12:45:45 <afidegnum>	but i have to look into that
Mar 02 12:46:04 <afidegnum>	because when i followed the guide earlier, the old settings still interfere
Mar 02 12:46:05 <wasamasa>	you mean, +HTML_HEAD: ?
Mar 02 12:46:13 <afidegnum>	yes
Mar 02 12:46:17 <wasamasa>	because there's a suspiciously named option like that in the example
Mar 02 12:46:35 <wasamasa>	just add one more entry to the alist with the same option, but a different value
Mar 02 12:46:41 <afidegnum>	i used this instead   #+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
Mar 02 12:48:23 <wasamasa>	that's not in the manual either
Mar 02 12:48:34 <wasamasa>	figure out the correct options first, then study the manual about them
Mar 02 12:48:43 <wasamasa>	it's there for a reason
Mar 02 12:49:16 <afidegnum>	here is the generated html file, https://dpaste.org/xE0u  how do i replace i.e <div id="outline-container-org132c92b" class="outline-2"> with my custom class? 
Mar 02 12:51:37 <quiliro>	kodein: https://podcastle.org/2009/10/09/pc-miniature-38-accounting-for-dragons/
Mar 02 12:53:12 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: can you please throw some light on the style change part ?
Mar 02 12:53:27 <afidegnum>	i mean element properties change
Mar 02 12:56:22 <wasamasa>	sorry, but you're missing out on some lisp basics
Mar 02 12:56:32 <wasamasa>	if you don't understand what an alist is I can't help you
Mar 02 12:57:28 <afidegnum>	i know alist
Mar 02 12:57:56 <afidegnum>	association list
Mar 02 12:58:58 <wasamasa>	yes, but do you actually understand what that means?
Mar 02 13:00:01 <afidegnum>	it associate symbols with another symbol 
Mar 02 13:00:09 <wasamasa>	wrong
Mar 02 13:00:12 <afidegnum>	i.e ((pine . cones) (oak . acorns) (maple . seeds))
Mar 02 13:00:39 <wasamasa>	look at that customizable, there's no symbol keys or values
Mar 02 13:00:47 <afidegnum>	list containing symbol pairs
Mar 02 13:01:38 <wasamasa>	look at org-publish-project-alist and tell me, what kind of keys and values does it have?
Mar 02 13:03:11 <afidegnum>	i.e :base-directory "~/org/" :base-extension "org" :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/" :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
Mar 02 13:05:09 <wasamasa>	wrong
Mar 02 13:05:15 <wasamasa>	you don't understand alists at all
Mar 02 13:05:21 <afidegnum>	?
Mar 02 13:06:14 <wasamasa>	the correct answer is that this alist has a string key "org" and a list value (:base-directory "~/org" ...)
Mar 02 13:06:46 <afidegnum>	ok, i have taken note
Mar 02 13:06:48 <wasamasa>	if you want to have another project, you'll need to provide another alist entry with a string key and a list value
Mar 02 13:06:56 <quiliro>	isn't that a symbol pair?
Mar 02 13:07:09 <wasamasa>	a string isn't a symbol and a list isn't a symbol either
Mar 02 13:07:20 <wasamasa>	alists often have symbols for keys, yes, but not always
Mar 02 13:08:17 <wasamasa>	the list value resembles a plist which is a list with alternating key and value items
Mar 02 13:08:26 <wasamasa>	with keys typically being keywords
Mar 02 13:09:24 <afidegnum>	ok, i was targeting the inner elements that's why
Mar 02 13:09:36 <quiliro>	what is the difference between a key and a keyword?
Mar 02 13:09:59 <wasamasa>	a keyword is a type, a key is a name for something you use to look up a pair in a key-value data structure
Mar 02 13:10:23 <wasamasa>	alists and plists are two commonly used key-value data structures in many lisp dialects
Mar 02 13:10:49 <parsnip>	perhaps s/a keyword is a type/keyword is a type/
Mar 02 13:10:50 <wasamasa>	afidegnum: it's crucial to understand what an alist is before messing around with plists in their values
Mar 02 13:12:23 <afidegnum>	ok, i m learning gradually 
Mar 02 13:15:28 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: is it possible to set up a prompt per project to enter custom parameters to org-publish-project-alist ?
Mar 02 13:16:01 <wasamasa>	it depends on how much of a masochist you are
Mar 02 13:16:08 <wasamasa>	I wouldn't bother
Mar 02 13:16:16 <wasamasa>	just edit that variable and republish
Mar 02 13:18:39 <afidegnum>	the reason why i'm asking is instead of manually edit init.el on each project creation to assign custom themes and other configs, i was thiking of there is another way to make life easier
Mar 02 13:19:07 <wasamasa>	it doesn't really make your life easier
Mar 02 13:19:30 <wasamasa>	you either edit a sexp with the full support of your text editor or you edit it with poor support of your text editor
Mar 02 13:20:19 <wasamasa>	you will put in lots of effort for barely of an improvement in UX, if at all
Mar 02 13:21:17 <afidegnum>	hmm... 
Mar 02 13:21:53 <afidegnum>	what do you suggest ?
Mar 02 13:22:01 <wasamasa>	<wasamasa> I wouldn't bother
Mar 02 13:29:36 <terzievk>	I installed ghc with pacman and haskell-mode on emacs. Now when I open a .hs the following error pops up in the minibuffer: Could not find module ‘Prelude’
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	There are files missing in the ‘base-4.13.0.0’ package,
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	try running 'ghc-pkg check'.
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for.
Mar 02 13:29:40 <terzievk>	 
Mar 02 13:31:40 <terzievk>	What should I do?
Mar 02 13:35:41 <edgar-rft>	buy me a drink
Mar 02 13:37:06 <terzievk>	I might if it helps, but I don't think it will
Mar 02 13:37:50 <edgar-rft>	don't think, pay
Mar 02 13:38:28 <wasamasa>	it suggests you what commands to run
Mar 02 13:38:33 <wasamasa>	why don't you do that
Mar 02 13:38:39 <wasamasa>	rudybot: like all other men do
Mar 02 13:38:44 <rudybot>	wasamasa: pfft, reading Dworkin doesn't make me feel like a monster, it reaffirms my inner feelings about all the other men being monsters, making me feel sane and understood
Mar 02 13:41:16 <terzievk>	wasamasa: becuase it list numerous warnings like haddock-html ... isn't a file
Mar 02 13:42:40 <wasamasa>	see if you can fix them
Mar 02 13:45:59 <terzievk>	edgar-rft: post names and address and I might
Mar 02 13:47:04 <terzievk>	edgar-rft: send some beer your way
Mar 02 13:48:10 <csed>	Ok uh, anyone know how to limit how much space lsp-mode takes up when expanding on function docs?
Mar 02 13:48:25 <csed>	Because it legit just took over like, 95% of my screen for open() docs.
Mar 02 13:54:31 <parsnip>	sorry, i drank it
Mar 02 14:01:44 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: if i understand, to publish org-html i need to set my .init.el with org-publish-project-alist, then add #+STYLE: for my custom style, how do i change the theme ?
Mar 02 14:01:53 <afidegnum>	any writeup i can refer to ?
Mar 02 14:02:23 <wasamasa>	please read the manual
Mar 02 14:02:37 <wasamasa>	it tells you what options org knows
Mar 02 14:39:44 <afidegnum>	i give up
Mar 02 14:49:28 <mplsCorwin>	afidegnum: did you read this page? https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html
Mar 02 14:50:55 <wasamasa>	not to forget https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing-options.html
Mar 02 14:52:00 <wasamasa>	there's considerable overlap between both manual pages
Mar 02 15:02:52 <alephnull>	wasamasa: I caught your hangout with sachac yesterday. Nice stuff, the calendar was particularly eye-opening.
Mar 02 15:11:34 <loskutak>	alephnull: is that available somewhere?
Mar 02 15:11:49 <alephnull>	YouTube
Mar 02 15:12:23 <alephnull>	Its from 2015, iirc
Mar 02 15:14:46 <loskutak>	oh I thought there is some new one
Mar 02 15:18:52 <wasamasa>	what calendar?
Mar 02 15:58:48 <yates>	,, shell-command-on-region
Mar 02 15:58:49 <fsbot>	ERROR: This looks like a large search. TODO: search as a string instead of regex and prefix result with [LargeSearch]

Mar 02 15:59:06 <fsbot>	Nooo!  This looks like a large search. TODO: search as a string instead of regex and prefix result with [LargeSearch]
Mar 02 15:59:54 <wasamasa>	I'm not sure why you expect it to be any different on the second attempt
Mar 02 16:01:03 <yates>	the help for the command shell-command-on-region it states "Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input". so under linux would that result in a "cat region | COMMAND" type of construct?
Mar 02 16:01:36 <wasamasa>	more like COMMAND < region
Mar 02 16:02:12 <yates>	ok
Mar 02 16:02:21 <wasamasa>	but yes
Mar 02 16:02:47 <yates>	btw wasamasa the second ",," is not identical - there is one less " " (space)

Mar 02 16:03:18 <yates>	ok... 
Mar 02 16:03:33 <wasamasa>	you want ,,df shell-command-on-region
Mar 02 16:03:34 <fsbot>	shell-command-on-region is an interactive compiled Lisp function in

Mar 02 16:03:47 <yates>	aha. thanks!
Mar 02 16:04:41 <wasamasa>	otherwise the thing after the comma is interpreted as fsbot command

Mar 02 16:04:58 <wasamasa>	and it's not a valid search term for the wiki either, so it fails
Mar 02 16:05:15 <yates>	i see (said the blind man...)
Mar 02 16:09:20 <yates>	btw, is the hexl-mode command written in C? it takes awhile to render large files (256M-ish)
Mar 02 16:09:43 *	shrysr waves at wasamasa .. found the alist thread instructive.. ty. i gotta rtfm moaaar
Mar 02 16:11:00 <wasamasa>	hexl-mode is written in elisp and calls the hexl program
Mar 02 16:12:53 <wasamasa>	performance issues are most likely its use of overlays
Mar 02 16:12:56 <wasamasa>	try nhexl-mode

Mar 18 12:42:06 *	Topic for #emacs set by jrm!~jrm@freebsd/developer/jrm (Thu Mar  5 14:56:35 2020)
Mar 18 12:42:06 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Mar 18 12:52:38 <thblt>	Yesterday in the vegetables stand of the food market, the sellers were forbidding people to touch the food themselves, and instead would pick and pack food for them.  From a strictly prophylactic perspective, it seems grossly inefficient, since they would certainly get contaminated by money, then in turn contaminate the food. Opinions, #emacs?
Mar 18 12:52:51 <thblt>	OTOH of cours, it helps carry the message that something important is happening.
Mar 18 12:53:40 <quiliro>	The person that touches the money should not touch the food.
Mar 18 12:55:00 <quiliro>	Maybe using a different hand for each as the indians do for the toilet, would be appropriate.
Mar 18 12:56:05 <thblt>	Maybe they could have done this. I wonder if they were acting on official instructions.
Mar 18 12:56:13 <quiliro>	Another strategy could be maybe touching the money with ta tool instead of with the hands.
Mar 18 12:56:31 <quiliro>	s/ta/a/
Mar 18 12:57:16 <thblt>	Yeah, maybe.  I have a feeling the best approach would be to do business as usual (clients pick their food) but tell people to *really* clean it up.
Mar 18 12:57:44 <quiliro>	But all in all, the problem of transmission of diseases by contact is not new. Why paralyze entire countries when there are much greater numbers of deaths for other reasons.
Mar 18 12:57:45 <thblt>	But it lacks the dramatic element which may have been the important part there.
Mar 18 12:58:30 <thblt>	Deaths are not the issue, respirators are, ER beds too.  
Mar 18 12:58:43 <thblt>	(From what I've gathered.)
Mar 18 12:59:01 <loskutak>	Hi, I have to work from home due to coronavirus and my connection is not very good. Whenever the connection fails, emacs freezes completely and I don't know what to do about that. Pressing (even multiple times, ore even holding) C-g does not help. Sending emacs SIGUSR2 signal does not help either... Any ideas? Maybe tweaking some tramp setting?
Mar 18 12:59:47 <quiliro>	But countries spend large sums of money for other areas, they do it immediately. They could easily buy those resources if it meant money for them.
Mar 18 13:01:20 <thblt>	quiliro: The issue is production capabilities too.  France has started deploying military field hospitals, but equipement is a huge issue. 
Mar 18 13:01:22 <quiliro>	loskutak: i have noticed the same problem for other reasons with Emacs freezing when some process is not complete also.
Mar 18 13:01:52 <thblt>	(Again, there are real experts if you want real advice :), that's what I've understood, and it seems to make sense)
Mar 18 13:02:03 <quiliro>	I was amazed by the chinese constructing a giant hospital in just a couple of weeks!
Mar 18 13:02:37 <thblt>	You can probably buy hospitals on AliExpress now.
Mar 18 13:02:48 <quiliro>	It is possible. Just politicians and corporations are not interested.
Mar 18 13:02:50 <loskutak>	I don't even know how to pinpoint the exact call that causes this freezing :/
Mar 18 13:03:19 <quiliro>	loskutak: maybe you can debug-on-error
Mar 18 13:04:36 <quiliro>	or just debug or debug-on-entry for tramp
Mar 18 13:04:43 <loskutak>	quiliro: But it seems there is no error... I have tried debug-on-quit, but I just cannot get emacs to quit the action it is doing, so that doesn't seem to help either
Mar 18 13:05:14 <quiliro>	loskutak: how did it go for debug-on-entry
Mar 18 13:05:18 <quiliro>	?
Mar 18 13:06:03 <loskutak>	quiliro: well when emacs is ok, this wont help I guess... When it is frozen, I cannot debug-on-entry
Mar 18 13:06:28 <quiliro>	but you can see what happened just before
Mar 18 13:08:12 <quiliro>	loskutak: what do you use tramp for? maybe you can make a copy of files with git, if it is just editing files. you could just ssh, if you are running processes. other solutions for other processes, etc
Mar 18 13:08:39 <quiliro>	I think the problem with Emacs is that it is not multithread.
Mar 18 13:08:56 <quiliro>	So it must finisc one thing before it deos the next.
Mar 18 13:09:21 <quiliro>	s/finisc/finish/
Mar 18 13:10:34 <thblt>	loskutak: You may also try sshfs if you're on Linux, or git, or scp, or rsync… If it's an exceptional situation you don't need a perfect solution.
Mar 18 13:12:08 <quiliro>	I think this coronavirus pandemic is not more tragic than high blood pressure or even glaucoma. I think it is bad for those that have the virus more because of the discrimination. But the whole population is affected by the constraints even more.
Mar 18 13:13:56 <quiliro>	I think more deaths and sickness are caused by the constraints and the poverty caused than by the virus in the worst circumstance. I think it is an economic issue for the rich. But of course, this is just a hunch. i have not made an investigation. All I know is that it does not smell good.
Mar 18 13:14:09 <quiliro>	It sounds like a scam.
Mar 18 13:14:22 <quiliro>	...a very well planned scam.
Mar 18 13:15:59 <quiliro>	But i am not certain
Mar 18 13:17:50 <quiliro>	wasamasa told me yesterday to investigate the effects of esxml-query on my xml file which is embedded on an another xml. I will try to understand how that function works. Will test it with a simpler xml file.

Mar 18 13:41:07 <quiliro>	loskutak: I think that a cable will make a better connection than wireless. Never know if it will be solved just by that.
Mar 18 13:42:32 <quiliro>	I can never copy and paste from pdf files. They are not displayed as text, but as images with DocView
Mar 18 13:42:50 <loskutak>	quiliro: the issue is that my internet connection is wireless and I cannot easily quickly change that. The home wifi works ok and there is not much difference between wifi and cable on my LAN.
Mar 18 13:43:09 <wasamasa>	quiliro: do you understand how xml documents are represented as trees?
Mar 18 13:43:32 <quiliro>	loskutak: Oh...You use a WISP.
Mar 18 13:43:36 <wasamasa>	quiliro: do you understand how css selectors work?
Mar 18 13:43:40 <quiliro>	wasamasa: yes
Mar 18 13:43:47 <quiliro>	tags inside of tags
Mar 18 13:44:02 <quiliro>	with those being branches of branches
Mar 18 13:44:33 <quiliro>	i don't know what css selectors are
Mar 18 13:44:40 <wasamasa>	well, then you've got some learning to do
Mar 18 13:44:41 <quiliro>	i will investigate
Mar 18 13:44:55 <wasamasa>	once you understand both, you should have no issues with that library
Mar 18 13:45:25 <quiliro>	ok...thanks for guiding
Mar 18 13:48:21 <wasamasa>	but yeah, it's a good idea to experiment with a simpler xml document
Mar 18 13:52:15 <jmd>	Is there a way I can put some special filter/postprocessing in the *compilation* buffer ?
Mar 18 13:54:52 <quiliro>	CSS selectors are just selected style patterns
Mar 18 13:55:33 <quiliro>	never used named them as such ...but I can recognize them in the files.
Mar 18 13:55:34 <wasamasa>	if you can write css selectors that match the part of the xml document you're interested in, you're good to go
Mar 18 13:57:03 <quiliro>	I can ...I see you did when you wrote: (esxml-query "comprobante>factura>detalles" xml)
Mar 18 13:57:24 <quiliro>	and I can see the tree is that way on my xml file
Mar 18 13:58:06 <quiliro>	comprobante is the bigger branch from which factura emerges ... and detalles emerges from factura
Mar 18 13:59:12 <quiliro>	But I got nothing if I execute that command or even one created by me:
Mar 18 13:59:27 <wasamasa>	then the query doesn't match anything in that document
Mar 18 14:00:08 <quiliro>	it does
Mar 18 14:00:23 <wasamasa>	at some point you
Mar 18 14:00:25 <quiliro>	but maybe the xml file is not recognized because of CDATA
Mar 18 14:00:33 <wasamasa>	I mean, at some point you've made a mistake then
Mar 18 14:00:53 <wasamasa>	yes, matching isn't done inside cdata because cdata is a way to quote text in a xml document
Mar 18 14:01:04 <wasamasa>	that quoted text isn't its own tree you can perform matching on
Mar 18 14:01:17 <wasamasa>	it's text you have to extract, parse and process
Mar 18 14:02:27 <quiliro>	ok...will try now....thanks for your pointers, wasamasa 
Mar 18 14:16:05 <thblt>	amosbird: no idea. There's a package called unfill to do the unfilling, but de-hyphenating is impossible, unless the PDF uses a different character for the hyphenation dash.  
Mar 18 14:22:44 <loskutak>	oh my gosh, I think I will mostly stop using tramp. Working on localhost and then rsyncing to the remote is so frigging fast :D
Mar 18 14:23:07 <wasamasa>	yeah, that
Mar 18 14:23:19 <wasamasa>	I wrote a package to do anything I want on save to help with that part
Mar 18 14:25:30 <loskutak>	firestarter?
Mar 18 14:25:31 <fsbot>	I think firestarter is [0] https://github.com/wasamasa/firestarter
Mar 18 14:25:31 <fsbot>	[1] Execute (shell) commands on save
Mar 18 14:25:46 <jmd>	I can't seem to get compilation-parse-errors-filename-function to work as documented.
Mar 18 14:25:52 <jmd>	(or at all)
Mar 18 14:26:00 <jmd>	Is there a trick to it?
Mar 18 14:26:28 <dustfinger>	I use exwm and am constantly working. I would like to slowly re-write my emacs config. Is there a safe way to reload the config, while running exwm so that I don't have to close all my buffers inbetween?
Mar 18 14:26:53 <python476>	thblt: first time I realize the purpose of having different dash
Mar 18 14:28:08 <grym>	wasamasa: i think that solves an org rendering want i've been having for a while, thanks 
Mar 18 14:30:34 <quiliro>	What is ROOT in (esxml-query SELECTOR ROOT) ? the highest level branch, or the branch directly above SELECTOR?
Mar 18 14:30:45 <wasamasa>	a XML node
Mar 18 14:31:06 <amosbird>	thblt: is "de-hyphenating" a word?
Mar 18 14:31:13 <quiliro>	wasamasa: I understand that
Mar 18 14:31:23 <quiliro>	oh!
Mar 18 14:31:47 <AimHere>	amosbird, if it isn't, the meaning would be obvious enough that if you started using it, everyone would know what you meant and you'd make a new word
Mar 18 14:32:08 <AimHere>	So I wouldn't worry about whether it is or not. 
Mar 18 14:32:11 <quiliro>	I will investigate what is the diffence between selector and node
Mar 18 14:35:23 <parsnip>	ugh, crappy bug report is crappy? https://github.com/bradyt/dart-mode/issues/109
Mar 18 14:35:36 <parsnip>	this... doesn't even have anything to do with dart-mode
Mar 18 14:35:45 <loskutak>	wasamasa: thanks for the firestarter, that is super useful
Mar 18 14:35:52 <parsnip>	also... what kind of reproduce is that?
Mar 18 14:35:58 <parsnip>	"i pressed some button, bad happened"
Mar 18 14:36:28 <parsnip>	i hate getting shitty bug reports from people who are payed by google
Mar 18 14:36:40 <parsnip>	why the fuck am i maintaining a google plugin?
Mar 18 14:37:58 <wasamasa>	why the fuck are you dealing with google software
Mar 18 14:38:25 <wasamasa>	funny, I've got a bug report by the same user
Mar 18 14:38:27 <thblt>	python476: I *think* some PDF generators do smarter things, like dropping the hyphen AND the \n in the text layer, or just putting the unhyphenated word there.  But I don't know which ones.  
Mar 18 14:39:33 <wasamasa>	parsnip: what makes you think they're a googler?

Mar 18 15:55:57 <parsnip>	"sorry, no open issues without a pull request"
Mar 18 15:58:56 <python476>	yesterday saw a lot more patches
Mar 18 15:58:56 <npostavs>	parsnip: I don't think that is a reasonable interpration of the post.
Mar 18 15:59:05 <python476>	confinement supports open source software
Mar 18 15:59:49 <parsnip>	npostavs: how so?
Mar 18 16:00:15 <parsnip>	the issue persists, the issue is closed, and they said they prefer a PR
Mar 18 16:01:10 <npostavs>	parsnip: yes, *prefer* a PR, not that issues without PRs are disallowed
Mar 18 16:01:22 <parsnip>	the issue is still closed
Mar 18 16:15:00 <parsnip>	why was it closed in the first place
Mar 18 16:15:16 <quiliro>	I used (esxml-query "head" "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en-US\"> ....") , but I got nil
Mar 18 16:15:31 <wasamasa>	you forgot the parsing step
Mar 18 16:15:36 <wasamasa>	it won't work on strings
Mar 18 16:15:45 <wasamasa>	it's why it's named esxml
Mar 18 16:15:54 <wasamasa>	it works on a particular kind of s-expressions, coined esxml
Mar 18 16:16:12 <quiliro>	what does parsing mean? will check the Emacs manual
Mar 18 16:16:27 <quiliro>	will also look what is esxml
Mar 18 16:16:28 <wasamasa>	turning a string into a parse tree
Mar 18 16:16:49 <quiliro>	will  also look what a parse tree is
Mar 18 16:17:14 <npostavs>	parsnip: yeah, that's a good question.  It seems the OP never explained why they closed it.
Mar 18 16:17:39 <wasamasa>	going from "<foo>bar</foo>" to (foo nil "bar")
Mar 18 16:17:45 <parsnip>	i tried to draft a PR a couple weeks ago, but ran into an issue, so somehow i felt we should just open it
Mar 18 16:18:11 <parsnip>	but apparently i have to write up a freakin' thesis to have an issue opened
Mar 18 16:18:27 <parsnip>	whereas, _there's no reason for it to be closed_
Mar 18 16:18:48 <parsnip>	i think the internet has the flu
Mar 18 16:19:00 <parsnip>	you all need to go back to bed
Mar 18 16:19:03 <quiliro>	so I will need libxml-parse-xml-region
Mar 18 16:19:13 <quiliro>	to parse the string
Mar 18 16:19:18 <quiliro>	is that right?
Mar 18 16:19:23 <wasamasa>	I'm mildly curious how long until you've got all of this figured out
Mar 18 16:19:33 <wasamasa>	we've went over these topics a bunch of times
Mar 18 16:19:54 <quiliro>	it is just that is was much more complicated for me before
Mar 18 16:20:15 <wasamasa>	and it's not just me, but other people from this channel
Mar 18 16:20:16 <quiliro>	it is still a little difficult, but I understand a little more
Mar 18 16:20:33 <quiliro>	i have been reading elisp intro
Mar 18 16:20:55 <quiliro>	I am almost half way through
Mar 18 16:21:13 <quiliro>	and read some of Xah lee's elisp intro
Mar 18 16:21:54 <quiliro>	have been using describe-function with your script too
Mar 18 16:22:21 <quiliro>	Is there anything else to do. Am I not following the correct process?
Mar 18 16:22:47 <quiliro>	Perhaps the examples were too complicated for my starter level
Mar 18 16:23:04 <quiliro>	and that made it take more time to understand
Mar 18 16:23:20 <quiliro>	I got a lot from elisp intro
Mar 18 16:23:48 <quiliro>	which I started reading lately. I even printed it.
Mar 18 16:26:14 <wasamasa>	the understanding part is crucial
Mar 18 16:26:50 <quiliro>	haha
Mar 18 16:26:55 <quiliro>	of course
Mar 18 16:27:36 <quiliro>	for me it was very difficult to understand your example because I did not understand the basics of elisp
Mar 18 16:27:44 <quiliro>	I did everything i was told
Mar 18 16:27:59 <quiliro>	But did not read the elisp intro
Mar 18 16:28:37 <quiliro>	i was reading the source, but that was confusing at first without the concepts presented by that manual
Mar 18 16:29:31 <quiliro>	anyway, if it is too cumbersome, I will refrain from asking until I spend at least a week with a question.
Mar 18 16:29:53 <quiliro>	will that be better?
Mar 18 16:30:26 <wasamasa>	whatever works for you
Mar 18 16:31:23 <cvandusen>	You might set smaller goals. It's not unlike someone new to Emacs/Elisp and deciding to write a major mode.
Mar 18 16:31:26 <wasamasa>	it just doesn't seem like you're making progress
Mar 18 16:31:40 <quiliro>	what has worked has been asking immediately...I have learned a lot. But it seems too heavy weight for you
Mar 18 16:31:53 <wasamasa>	you are currently struggling with basic buffer manipulation and ask for stuff based on that
Mar 18 16:32:06 <quiliro>	that is what i am learning
Mar 18 16:32:15 <quiliro>	buffer manipulation
Mar 18 16:32:35 <wasamasa>	then you'll have to learn common constructs like using temporary variables and loops
Mar 18 16:32:35 <quiliro>	but i cannot find info regarding that
Mar 18 16:32:41 <quiliro>	ok
Mar 18 16:32:45 <wasamasa>	that's like the only topic in eintr
Mar 18 16:32:50 <quiliro>	thank you for the pointers
Mar 18 16:33:26 <quiliro>	well, almost the whole of eintr has been very insightful for me
Mar 18 16:33:45 <quiliro>	up to the point I am at now
Mar 18 16:38:31 <parsnip>	this day has started out horribly, _because people are talking to me_
Mar 18 16:38:45 <parsnip>	what happened to social distancing? i thought this would go better for me.
Mar 18 16:39:57 <parsnip>	break the problem into smaller parts
Mar 18 16:40:22 <hodapp>	HEY PARTHNIP LET ME TELL YOU THIS HILARIOUTH JOKE I JUTH *cough cough cough cough* HEARD
Mar 18 16:41:35 <parsnip>	wasamasa: has this problem already been factored as much as possible? like, the most complicated step should be from String to AST, right?
Mar 18 16:41:58 <parsnip>	keep that working, maybe tested, no?
Mar 18 16:42:07 <wasamasa>	sure, that works
Mar 18 16:42:22 <wasamasa>	the thing is just, you have to know how to do that
Mar 18 16:42:53 <python476>	parsnip: non linear response in anxious crowds
Mar 18 16:43:19 <parsnip>	that escalated quickly (too soon?)
Mar 18 16:44:34 <wasamasa>	quiliro: anyway, I went through github and found this: https://github.com/xuchunyang/elisp-demos/blob/master/elisp-demos.org#L6706
Mar 18 16:47:42 <python476>	pl
Mar 18 16:48:23 <wasamasa>	stupidly big file
Mar 18 16:48:39 <wasamasa>	it seems the library is used in more projects than expected
Mar 18 16:48:58 <shrysr>	i have just started https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/el-intro ..
Mar 18 16:50:05 <shrysr>	using nov.el :) ty wasamasa 
Mar 18 16:50:13 <wasamasa>	you're welcome
Mar 18 16:50:24 <wasamasa>	but if you're reading it in emacs, why not use info?
Mar 18 16:51:17 <shrysr>	info can read epub ?
Mar 18 16:51:42 <wasamasa>	no, the manual is originally provided as info file
Mar 18 16:51:44 <quiliro>	wasamasa: nice
Mar 18 16:51:46 <wasamasa>	and shipped with emacs
Mar 18 16:52:00 <wasamasa>	someone converted it to epub - for offline reading I suppose
Mar 18 16:52:04 <shrysr>	wait a sec. Is the book the same as the manual ?? 
Mar 18 16:52:05 <fsbot>	Highly likely
Mar 18 16:52:25 <shrysr>	lmao... okay. i need coffee. 
Mar 18 16:52:25 <wasamasa>	yes, same author and everything
Mar 18 16:54:42 <shrysr>	yea. it says so ... first line in the repo. i prob need cocaine
Mar 18 16:55:35 <npostavs>	shrysr: to be fair, looks like it only started saying that yesterday. https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/el-intro/-/commit/77a220b9d7a58b0d2da1b5231beb13fc31fb6c50
Mar 18 16:57:02 <npostavs>	And why are the commit messages after the first two just some random names?
Mar 18 17:00:53 <jmd>	What's the predicate to test whether a symbol has a definition as a variable?
Mar 18 17:01:11 <npostavs>	jmd: boundp
Mar 18 17:02:13 <quiliro>	Initial commit 2020-03-14
Mar 18 17:02:21 <thblt>	also useful is bound-and-true-p
Mar 18 17:03:48 <thblt>	(which is admittedly just a shorthand for (and (boundp 'var) 'var))
Mar 18 17:03:49 <quiliro>	,moon

Mar 19 13:53:35 <codingquark>	parsnip: ~3min
Mar 19 13:53:59 <codingquark>	This is actually the first time I'm syncing the account. It is a new one I got for $WORK
Mar 19 13:54:23 <codingquark>	Being a beta release, it probably has a lot of issues.
Mar 19 13:54:51 <parsnip>	seems fine. you could make it less frequent if you make it easier to selectively refresh boxes from mu4e. but then you have to watch out for weirdness, like if you move an email, you probably want to sync both the target and source box.
Mar 19 13:54:56 <codingquark>	For example: {"level":"error","msg":"cannot send response tag 18 'UID FETCH completed': write tcp 127.0.0.1:1143-\u003e127.0.0.1:34248: write: broken pipe","pkg":"server-imap","time":"2020-03-19T18:24:25+05:30"}
Mar 19 13:55:20 <parsnip>	generally, i mostly need my email refreshed when my phone buzzes, or when i just sent an email.
Mar 19 13:55:51 <parsnip>	so if my phone buzzes, i should have a key that syncs INBOX and reindexes
Mar 19 13:56:16 <parsnip>	i never really polished these, but that was the goal
Mar 19 13:56:17 <codingquark>	Nice idea since you rely on phone.
Mar 19 13:56:30 <parsnip>	your phone doesn't buzz when you get an email?
Mar 19 13:56:41 <codingquark>	I keep it away when I'm working.
Mar 19 13:57:53 <codingquark>	For work, things are much more streamlined now: stuff happens on Basecamp and only some emails.
Mar 19 13:58:24 <codingquark>	Some people still message on Slack, but since I do not check it often, they are tuning to expect that.
Mar 19 14:00:22 <codingquark>	After moving to Basecamp, shit got real nice and clean. Since I and others enjoy writing lengthy, thoughtful things over sync comm, it allows people to be more "calm".
Mar 19 14:00:38 <codingquark>	For some this is not so intuitive yet. But I'll help them see.

Mar 19 14:13:41 <parsnip>	video calls are so bougie
Mar 19 14:13:50 <codingquark>	PITA
Mar 19 14:17:37 <parsnip>	yeah, i find it very tedious to get the green screen setup, then set an indian jones scene as the background
Mar 19 14:18:05 <parsnip>	actually, i guess some micorosoft ad shows that feature
Mar 19 14:18:58 <codingquark>	I just don't want to talk on calls.
Mar 19 14:19:21 <parsnip>	yeah in today's world phone calls are sort of the last option
Mar 19 14:19:31 <parsnip>	"why are you calling me?"
Mar 19 14:19:37 <codingquark>	Video or speech. Daily meetings are waste of time, and so is discussing technical stuff.
Mar 19 14:19:59 <parsnip>	ah, getting into the weeds
Mar 19 14:20:15 <codingquark>	Things are forgotten, and many times simply lost. More problems when new persons want to join in.
Mar 19 14:20:30 <telmich>	good day! I have a function `(defun vcs-filename (&optional arg) (concat "~/vcs/notes/" (format-time-string "%Y") "-" arg system-name ".org"))` and I am trying to use it's return value in another function like this:
Mar 19 14:20:31 <telmich>	`(setq org-capture-templates '(("t" "todo" entry (file+headline (vcs-filename "todo-") "Tasks") "* TODO [#B] %?\nSCHEDULED: %(org-insert-time-stamp (org-read-date nil t \"+0d\"))\n%a\n")))` 
Mar 19 14:20:43 <parsnip>	*its
Mar 19 14:21:00 <telmich>	However it seems that `(vcs-filename "todo-")` returns nil - is there something I am doing conceptually wrong?
Mar 19 14:21:18 <telmich>	(even though it doesn't, if I call it in the scratch buffer)
Mar 19 14:43:17 <Bounga>	Hi, is there a way to scroll in a child frame using keyboard?
Mar 19 14:51:53 <loskutak>	I have a buffer with xyzvar=value lines. What is the best way to parse this into some better data structure (plist?)?
Mar 19 14:52:31 <tromey>	alists are more normal, I guess I'd probably just do it with a loop and a regexp

Mar 19 15:31:11 <jmd>	The compiler I'm using is dumping VT100 sequences (or something) into the *compilation* buffer which it can't handle nicely.  Is there a workaround for this?
Mar 19 15:31:30 <mplsCorwin>	loskutak: FWIW, I'd use mapcan or something with split-string to make a plist
Mar 19 15:32:23 <thblt>	jmd: polite compilers have a --no-color mode
Mar 19 15:32:47 <jmd>	thblt: Sure.  But I don't think this one is very polite :(
Mar 19 15:33:04 <Naptra>	Hello, how to check if I have cider-mode enabled in a buffer?
Mar 19 15:34:00 <mplsCorwin>	Naptra: I think you can get the list of enabled major mode and minor modes from C-h m
Mar 19 15:34:46 <thblt>	jmd: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24698/ansi-escape-sequences-in-compilation-mode the solution seems to add a process filter to remove the sequences. But who’s that rude compiler?
Mar 19 15:40:26 <jmd>	thblt: It's some ancient thing from the 1990s (yeah I know!)
Mar 19 15:43:05 <thblt>	jmd: I’de have expected those to be the polite ones.  What are the term sequences for, progress bars? 
Mar 19 15:43:48 <ldlework>	Does anyone know how to insert a row into a table with EmacSQL, where the :primary-key is :autoincrement?
Mar 19 15:43:55 <jmd>	I think they are indeed colours.
Mar 19 15:43:58 <ldlework>	It seems to want values...

Mar 19 16:15:02 <roadie>	in paths one can tab to the / ...
Mar 19 16:17:46 <jmd>	xristos: It's not clear from the comments how to use it in conjunction with compilation-mode
Mar 19 16:18:01 <jmd>	xterm-color
Mar 19 16:19:21 <jmd>	xterm-color-colorize-buffer seems to get rid of the escape sequences ok, but I have to call it every time something gets written to the buffer.
Mar 19 16:19:33 <jmd>	Maybe I need to add it to a hook.
Mar 19 16:20:19 <xristos>	did you read the documentation?
Mar 19 16:20:39 <jmd>	Not every word.
Mar 19 16:20:48 <jmd>	But yes I did read it.
Mar 19 16:20:56 <xristos>	did you miss this: For standalone compilation buffers use the following configuration
Mar 19 16:21:24 <jmd>	Yeah.  I'm not sure what it means by a standalone compilation buffer.
Mar 19 16:21:31 <jmd>	Aren't they all standalone?
Mar 19 16:21:54 <xristos>	no, there is compilation-shell-minor-mode as i previously mentioned
Mar 19 16:21:55 <jmd>	And that sentence is right under the bit about shell-minor mode
Mar 19 16:22:22 <jmd>	So from what you previously said I infered that it was not relevant.
Mar 19 16:22:46 <xristos>	try it, lmk if it works
Mar 19 16:23:40 <jmd>	Are you the author?
Mar 19 16:23:47 <xristos>	nod

Mar 19 16:42:58 <parsnip>	do people in other countries struggle when using a 0.00 format of currency?
Mar 19 16:43:21 <parsnip>	i mean, they would encounter it in programming anyways
Mar 19 16:44:10 <parsnip>	since most software i think comes out of us and china, so `0,000.00` and `0 000.00`, respectively.
Mar 19 16:44:27 <JordiGH>	meme.el requires imgur. Any idea where that could be found?
Mar 19 16:45:00 <jmd>	parsnip: The convention in India is most interesting.
Mar 19 16:45:04 <parsnip>	JordiGH: on the dork web
Mar 19 16:45:14 <parsnip>	00,00,000.00
Mar 19 16:45:44 <parsnip>	i've seen that... my app hasn't really thought about group separators yet
Mar 19 16:46:05 <parsnip>	i'm just trying to get decimal separators, because damnit, someone requested zero padding early on.
Mar 19 16:46:12 <JordiGH>	Aha: https://github.com/larsmagne/imgur.el
Mar 19 16:46:25 <parsnip>	i was sure you were telling a joke
Mar 19 16:46:31 <grym>	parsnip: i made a really derpy CSV export bug once that taught me to normalise separators 
Mar 19 16:46:34 <parsnip>	i can't tell when you're serious
Mar 19 16:46:53 <JordiGH>	The joke isn't told yet. That's what I need meme.el and imgur.el for
Mar 19 16:46:56 <grym>	everything worked fine until the danish guy used my modeling code and got twice as many columns in his CSV files than any other user
Mar 19 16:47:02 <parsnip>	grym: yeah, unfortunately ledger/hledger users have been spoiled
Mar 19 16:47:32 <parsnip>	i thought you were making a joke that we need meme.el, and that imgur would have to be a prerequisite
Mar 19 16:47:40 <grym>	parsnip: now i do whatever i have to to beat text numeric output into not using system encoding or localisations 
Mar 19 16:47:42 <parsnip>	TWO JOKES, even
Mar 19 16:48:35 <parsnip>	grym: yes, users are about to be upset, because i'm removing the numberLocale thing from the settings view. but i don't want to piss them off too bad, so they'll have to discover i'll parse the first commodity directive i find.
Mar 19 16:49:01 <parsnip>	so now the app will default to "0.00 XXX"
Mar 19 16:49:23 <parsnip>	and they'll have to go through jumps and loops to change it.
Mar 19 16:49:40 <JordiGH>	parsnip: the joke is serious: https://github.com/larsmagne/meme
Mar 19 16:49:46 <JordiGH>	memegenerator is down, so I need an alternative.
Mar 19 16:50:07 <parsnip>	if you think they won't whine, people are already like, "we need little-endian dates"
Mar 19 16:50:31 <parsnip>	jokes can't be serious
Mar 19 16:50:35 <JordiGH>	Dammit, it's buggy.
Mar 19 16:50:59 *	parsnip stubbornly spells it "damnit"
Mar 19 16:51:57 <parsnip>	hmm, "damnit" is claimed to be a southern US spelling
Mar 19 16:52:50 <parsnip>	> Wafflehouse, 'Damnit' is the correct spelling and has been for a long, long time. (if you put 'damn' and 'it' together you don't get 'idontknowhowtospell' you get 'damnit.' I'm trying to figure out where this change originated, but be assured that your statement is so far from correct that you can't see it from this side of the sun. It is neither an incorrect contraction or common misspelling (the spelling 'dammit' is

Mar 19 16:54:06 <mplsCorwin>	LUL
Mar 19 16:55:02 <parsnip>	i officially take issue with your spelling of damnit
Mar 19 16:56:03 <jmd>	xristos: Well it seems to be effective in turning the escape codes into whitespace, which is an improvement, but not what I expected.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <wgreenhouse>	jmd: late to the party but does messing with ,,dv ansi-color-for-comint-mode,, affect your case?
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	Determines what to do with comint output.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If nil, do nothing.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If the symbol ‘filter’, then filter all SGR control sequences.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If anything else (such as t), then translate SGR control sequences ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

Mar 19 17:02:19 <bpalmer>	that's like the opposite of the great universe of taste I was leading you towards!

Mar 19 17:05:08 <bpalmer>	wgreenhouse: your $work is still open?
Mar 19 17:06:16 <defanor>	is there a known fix for the shell.el situation when comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp is active and new process output appears, leading to the search string being weirdly mixed with that output?
Mar 19 17:06:27 <wgreenhouse>	bpalmer: yeah--we're a legal aid office--bad shit is still happening to our clients so we're still here, about 50% work from home so far
Mar 19 17:06:41 <parsnip>	rudybot: is this the coreal space?
Mar 19 17:06:52 <rudybot>	parsnip: is there a way I can do this the way I want, C-space, up up up up up up up up up ( however many times ), C-space, C-k, C-o, C-y
Mar 19 17:07:50 <bpalmer>	defanor: I haven't run into that, I don't think.
Mar 19 17:08:02 <bpalmer>	oh, so you've previuosly put a process in background mode?
Mar 19 17:08:14 <xristos>	jmd: open up xterm-colortest (in xterm-color/tests/) in Emacs, then do M-x compile and input "perl xterm-colortest -w" instead of make ..
Mar 19 17:08:20 <xristos>	is the output in color?
Mar 19 17:09:18 <jmd>	I don't have perl on this machine.
Mar 19 17:09:54 <jmd>	M-x xterm-color-test works nicely though.
Mar 19 17:10:10 <xristos>	that doesn't exercise compilation-mode
Mar 19 17:11:24 <jmd>	I have a suspicion that some of the sequences I'm getting are not colours.  they might be cursor moves etc.
Mar 19 17:11:32 <xristos>	try
Mar 19 17:11:42 <xristos>	M-x compile in any buffer, and input printf "\x1b[0;1;3;4;35;51mThis is only a test\x1b[0m"
Mar 19 17:11:59 <defanor>	bpalmer: happens here quite reliably, at least with regular telnet(1). it's in foreground, though my emacs and shell.el may be a bit old
Mar 19 17:12:16 <jmd>	All those \x1b stuff are litereral?
Mar 19 17:12:28 <xristos>	yes you can copy paste it
Mar 19 17:13:15 <defanor>	hrm, wasn't able to reproduce it with just `sleep` and `echo`. maybe should tweak telnet's buffering or something
Mar 19 17:13:46 <defanor>	though i'm even not sure why that happens, but i guess it could be that comint handles line-buffered output well
Mar 19 17:14:14 <defanor>	oh, but i need it to be byte/character-buffered
Mar 19 17:15:16 <jmd>	xristos: Can you past that again for me?
Mar 19 17:15:48 <xristos>	jmd: M-x compile then input: printf "\x1b[0;1;3;4;35;51mThis is only a test\x1b[0m"
Mar 19 17:17:19 <jmd>	xristos: The text showed up pink and underlined.
Mar 19 17:17:26 <jmd>	and in a box.
Mar 19 17:18:07 <xristos>	ok then I guess your compiler doesn't produce SGR sequences
Mar 19 17:18:35 <jmd>	That is quite possible.
Mar 19 17:18:51 <xristos>	you can set xterm-color-debug to T, run it and look in *Messages* for not implemented messages
Mar 19 17:18:57 <xristos>	to verify that's the case
Mar 19 17:21:37 <jmd>	xristos: Yep.  There are quite a lot of them.
Mar 19 17:21:57 <xristos>	can you mail the output to me? xristos (at) sdf.org
Mar 19 17:22:14 <xristos>	(the xterm-color: output in *Messages*)
Mar 19 17:22:31 <jmd>	ok
Mar 19 17:23:32 <xristos>	also if you do C-h v process-connection-type what is the value?
Mar 19 17:23:52 <xristos>	and the same for compilation-environment
Mar 19 17:27:36 <yeti>	C-x C-c

Mar 19 17:36:12 *	JordiGH files an issue: https://github.com/larsmagne/meme/issues/5
Mar 19 17:36:23 <jmd>	compilation-environment is ("TERM=xterm-256color")
Mar 19 17:36:40 <xristos>	ok
Mar 19 17:36:55 <jmd>	(I sent that mail)
Mar 19 17:38:18 <rdbeni0>	which is best TAGs system for emacs? ctags, etags? exuberant ctags ? any recommendations
Mar 19 17:38:30 *	cvandusen waits for the "Kerning is catastrophic" meta-meme
Mar 19 17:38:59 <xristos>	rdbeni0: ggtags for me
Mar 19 17:39:43 <tromey>	I switched to ggtags as well.  it's nicer than the others since it auto-updates, but it is still not superb
Mar 19 17:40:30 <rdbeni0>	10 points for Gryffindor... sorry, 2 points for ggtags. Any other competitor ? what about ctags
Mar 19 17:41:11 <cvandusen>	lsp for me 
Mar 19 17:41:16 <tromey>	ctags is just etags with a different (I guess worse) file format
Mar 19 17:41:35 <tromey>	lsp is a good choice if you can use it
Mar 19 17:42:13 <xristos>	you can compile global with ctags support
Mar 19 17:42:20 <xristos>	that way it can use it for languages it doesn't support
Mar 19 17:42:25 <xristos>	i never bothered tho
Mar 19 17:44:04 <rdbeni0>	https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#installation so this is the latest lsp and it could be used instead of TAGs system, i am correct?
Mar 19 17:44:36 <xristos>	i would set up a solid tag system first, and then maybe bother with lsp
Mar 19 17:44:43 <xristos>	you can always rely on tags
Mar 19 17:44:52 <xristos>	lsp is questionable
Mar 19 17:48:19 <rdbeni0>	so GNU Global is TAG system, ggtags is mode for it. I am going google to table comparison between TAG systems, we will see
Mar 19 17:59:18 <loskutak>	I have tried to set up tags a few times, but there are so many options... superconfusing. etags ctags exuberant global. I just use dumbjump and while it is annoying from time to time, it is reasonably usable.
Mar 19 18:00:50 <jmd>	What's so confusing about just running "etags *.[ch]" ?
Mar 19 18:01:13 <mplsCorwin>	I can't even remember what I'm using.  I do recall it was a little fussy setting up on win10.  I think I needed msys32 and some stuff.  It's worked great for several upgrades to the point I haven't thought about it for some time.
Mar 19 18:01:26 <mplsCorwin>	it's probably etags
Mar 19 18:03:06 <xristos>	jmd: i went through the output and none of these are colors, mostly cursor placement, so it's to be expected they'll get filtered out
Mar 19 18:03:36 <jmd>	xristos: I suspected as much.
Mar 19 18:03:38 <MoziM>	ugh... the micro center better not be closed
Mar 19 18:04:12 <jmd>	The problem is, after filtering there are large amounts of vertical whitespace.
Mar 19 18:05:10 <mplsCorwin>	There's literally no tagging configuration I can find anywhere in my init scripts.  Whatever I did I think it was just drop an .exe in the right place and then I'm getting *something* OOB.  Maybe treemacs is doing the heavy lifting.
Mar 19 18:06:18 <mplsCorwin>	xristos: jmd: you guys have the foor.  sorry about the natter.
Mar 19 18:07:15 <thblt>	Hey this thing is starting to look like a keyboard https://i.imgur.com/IQo6V60.png
Mar 19 18:09:27 <cvandusen>	Either that or stadium seating.
Mar 19 18:09:41 <thblt>	The difference is in the dimensions.
Mar 19 18:10:01 <thblt>	(to be clear it’s the left half of a split keyboard)
Mar 19 18:13:50 <technomancy>	thblt: is this based on the dactyl?
Mar 19 18:14:37 <thblt>	technomancy: Loosely. It’s the same basic idea, but it’s laser-cut sheet metal instead of 3D printing.
Mar 19 18:15:24 <thblt>	(Or maybe laser-cut plastic)
Mar 19 18:15:25 <technomancy>	awesome. how powerful of a laser do you need to cut that metal? how thick is it?
Mar 19 18:15:35 <technomancy>	yeah laser-cut acrylic is easy peasy
Mar 19 18:16:02 <technomancy>	but I've only done very simple designs that are actually 3D rather than stacked layers
Mar 19 18:16:26 <technomancy>	that is a ridiculously large thumb cluster, lol
Mar 19 18:16:30 <thblt>	technomancy: 1.5mm, I have no idea about the laser power, but it’s a lot more than acrylic. 
Mar 19 18:17:04 <thblt>	I’m not too happy with it right now, but thumbs can move so I’m giving them keys to move on :)
Mar 19 18:17:32 <technomancy>	hitting the 5th key out on a thumb cluster is an uncomfortable stretch; hitting the sixth is just not a thing
Mar 19 18:17:43 <zellio>	you need 100s of watts to cut meta
Mar 19 18:18:03 <jmd>	Typically one cannot cut metal with a laser.
Mar 19 18:18:05 <wgreenhouse>	metawatts
Mar 19 18:18:18 <zellio>	but yeah, it's also reflective which means you can't really do much
Mar 19 18:18:31 <jmd>	The beam will simply bounce off into your face and blind you.
Mar 19 18:18:32 <zellio>	if you want to etch on meta there are ways to sortof go about doing it
Mar 19 18:18:36 <zellio>	*metal
Mar 19 18:20:46 <jmd>	The 130 W laser I'm working on costs > $30,000 just for the pump.  I dunno if Megawatt lasers exist outside of the military.
Mar 19 18:22:55 <grym>	jmd: but, do you have a phase conjugate tracking mirror 
Mar 19 18:23:39 <jmd>	... and even the best lasers have an efficiency of only around 10% so a MW laser would need a large power supply.
Mar 19 18:23:52 <jmd>	grym: No.
Mar 19 18:25:22 <fledermaus>	Do not stare into laser with remaining eye.
Mar 19 18:26:19 <fledermaus>	Unrelated: don't try to line up a diffraction grating by eye when you're half asleep in a 9am physics practical.
Mar 19 18:27:34 <grym>	jmd: oh good i won't have to buy up all that popcorn 
Mar 19 18:30:05 <jmd>	I think metal cutting is often done today using high  pressure water jets.
Mar 19 18:31:01 <technomancy>	yeah, water jets are more common when working with metal
Mar 19 18:31:05 <technomancy>	still crazy expensive tho
Mar 19 18:36:09 <Huck777>	hi, how can I set emacs, that after a 'cd' it stays there as a project folder? because when I open a file in 'templates/file.html' it stays in templates/ instead of being in the project folder. Or is my workflow wrong with helm-find-files?
Mar 19 18:38:27 <moowhool>	Hello everyone. Is there a way to get better qualit png in docview ?
Mar 19 18:39:07 <Ronis_BR>	Hi guys! I am having problems when displaying a file with a lot of numbers and using the `highlight-numbers-mode`. The performance is very, very bad. However, if I start emacs in text mode (`emacs -nw`), then it is fine.
Mar 19 18:39:17 <Ronis_BR>	Is there anything I can do to improve this in GUI?
Mar 19 18:41:50 <Amy1>	hello
Mar 19 18:42:00 <bpalmer>	Huck777: by default, default-directory after you open a file will be the directory containing that file. If you want to change that, you probably want a function in find-file-hook that resets default-directory
Mar 19 18:42:20 <Huck777>	bpalmer, ok - thank you
Mar 19 18:42:44 <Amy1>	(setq aa 2)
Mar 19 18:42:46 <Amy1>	(debug-on-variable-change aa)
Mar 19 18:43:06 <Amy1>	why not working?
Mar 19 18:43:28 <Amy1>	Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function debug-on-variable-change)
Mar 19 18:43:30 <Amy1>	  (debug-on-variable-change aa)
Mar 19 18:43:32 <bpalmer>	you probably need to quote the variable name in the call to debug-on-variable-change. Try (debug-on-variable-change 'aa)
Mar 19 18:43:32 <Amy1>	  eval((debug-on-variable-change aa) nil)
Mar 19 18:43:44 <grym>	water jets are so cool 
Mar 19 18:43:45 <grym>	har har

Mar 19 18:44:24 <Amy1>	grym: the same error
Mar 19 18:44:52 <Amy1>	bpalmer: I am using Emacs 25.3
Mar 19 18:45:27 <bpalmer>	Amy1: I believe that API was added in 26
Mar 19 18:45:50 <fledermaus>	it's not in 25
Mar 19 18:47:54 <Amy1>	bpalmer: yeah,you are right
Mar 19 18:56:08 <Amy1>	(setq bb 1)
Mar 19 18:56:10 <Amy1>	(setq bb 2)
Mar 19 18:56:12 <Amy1>	(add-variable-watcher 'bb (lambda () (print "hello")))
Mar 19 18:56:14 <Amy1>	(setq bb 3)
Mar 19 18:56:20 <Amy1>	why this not work?
Mar 19 18:57:06 <npostavs>	because you're not using Emacs 26?  (also, the lambda should accept some arguments)
Mar 19 19:02:21 <Amy1>	I am using 26.
Mar 19 19:02:40 <Amy1>	npostavs: could you show me the right code of add-variable-watcher?
Mar 19 19:08:21 <bpalmer>	Amy1: C-h f add-variable-watcher RET describes what parameters the function you provide needs to handle (it will have 4 arguments)
Mar 19 19:12:46 <bpalmer>	rudybot: the only thing to watch is a watch itself.
Mar 19 19:13:14 <rudybot>	bpalmer: nah, I won't watch it. it's action, violent etc., taking itself serious, trying to be popular, kinda not my thing, as an anime hipster
Mar 19 19:13:57 <oni-on-ion>	heh
Mar 19 19:17:43 <Amy1>	I still can't use this function.
Mar 19 19:17:56 <Amy1>	who can give me an example of add-variable-watcher

Mar 20 10:33:27 <ldlework>	ooooo
Mar 20 10:33:45 <ldlework>	been using emacs all these years but it justed occured to me that markers move as the buffer is edited
Mar 20 10:45:15 <flux1>	related to that: is there a way to move GDB breakpoints when you edit the buffer? that would be quite nice.
Mar 20 10:45:42 <flux1>	(last time I looked into it it seems GDB doesn't actually give a way to move a breakpoint, you need to delete and add :/)
Mar 20 11:04:33 <ldlework>	How do I get messages to stop getting cut off with ...

Mar 20 11:28:17 <rdbeni0>	i am going to start use & configure lsp-mode today
Mar 20 11:59:11 <wgreenhouse>	ldlework: not sure in what context this is happening but you could try setting or let-binding ,,dv print-length,, to nil
Mar 20 11:59:11 <fsbot>	Maximum length of list to print before abbreviating.
Mar 20 11:59:11 <fsbot>	A value of nil means no limit.  See also ‘eval-expression-print-length’.

Mar 20 15:48:39 <parsnip>	i think in some languages, != is replaced with =/=
Mar 20 15:48:52 <thblt>	It doesn’t have finer-grained input events than "pressed", and ctrl never gets "pressed" since it’s a modifier.
Mar 20 15:48:56 <yeti>	that's mor a strike thru
Mar 20 15:48:58 <thblt>	parsnip: Haskell uses /=

Mar 20 16:01:46 <thblt>	I don’t think you can create a non-ascii prefix unary operator in Haskell.
Mar 20 16:02:26 <thblt>	Unary - is a compiler trick IIRC 
Mar 20 16:03:17 <thblt>	Yes, -3 expands to (negate 3) at desugaring phase.

Mar 20 16:31:37 <thblt>	Ronis_BR: But your font shouldn’t affect performance. 
Mar 20 16:31:52 <thblt>	Menlo is Apple’s equivalent
Mar 20 16:31:59 <Ronis_BR>	thblt: it affects and it is very apparent
Mar 20 16:32:00 <rdbeni0>	i am using:   (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
Mar 20 16:33:37 <mplsCorwin>	Could font affect performance if the selected font is missing a bunch of unicode chars, languages etc, and this causes a bunch of glyph hunting?

Apr 02 09:56:48 <aidalgol>	I spelt it wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi
Apr 02 09:57:18 <aidalgol>	I don't think I've had that particular type of dumpling in a looooong time, if ever.
Apr 02 09:57:41 <aidalgol>	But I've had similar more recently
Apr 02 09:57:54 <twb>	aidalgol: I made pav bhaji recently
Apr 02 09:58:24 <twb>	I haven't made steamed bread in a LONG time
Apr 02 10:01:43 <aidalgol>	never had that one
Apr 02 10:08:16 <shrysr>	 well the bread doesnt ~have to be steamed for pav bhaji. cd be toasted with butter .. crunchy etc.
Apr 02 10:08:37 <andinus>	morning 0/
Apr 02 10:08:54 <ldlework>	god bless dumplings
Apr 02 10:09:05 <twb>	shrysr: yeah I was going back to bao
Apr 02 10:09:32 <twb>	shrysr: in china bread is steamed by default
Apr 02 10:09:40 <twb>	shrysr: and sometimes they put stuff inside
Apr 02 10:10:24 <shrysr>	they prolly do a lotta things.
Apr 02 10:11:10 <shrysr>	pav bhaji is indian afaik tho 
Apr 02 10:13:03 <shrysr>	thblt: howddya mean multiplexed reveal.js ?
Apr 02 10:16:39 <codingquark>	So now I need to upgrade OpenWRT
Apr 02 10:16:50 <codingquark>	It got fucked, apparently (not my specific router)
Apr 02 10:17:21 <twb>	codingquark: if it was pre-LEDE reunion, it's worth it
Apr 02 10:19:03 <codingquark>	twb: it's running 18.6 dude. But even that is compromised.
Apr 02 10:19:03 <codingquark>	twb: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/openwrt-is-vulnerable-to-attacks-that-execute-malicious-code/
Apr 02 10:19:04 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/nA7CDlHtY2
Apr 02 10:20:12 <Viking667>	quick question - once I've started emacs in daemon mode, how do I shut that down? (Yeah, I'm new to emacs, I normally run ${that_other_editor}
Apr 02 10:21:10 <shrysr>	Viking667: one way is ps aux |grep emacs  and then kill <pid>. ANother is start the emacsclient and M-x kill-emacs
Apr 02 10:22:09 <twb>	18.06 was first post-reunion release
Apr 02 10:22:11 <twb>	I knew it was close
Apr 02 10:22:31 <twb>	codingquark: OK so it's CVE 2020-7982
Apr 02 10:22:47 <twb>	https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7982
Apr 02 10:23:22 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, that one.
Apr 02 10:23:22 <twb>	codingquark: so the badness is in opkg checksum validation, so it will trigger iff you install a packag?
Apr 02 10:24:24 <Viking667>	hm, so both the methods I thought of then. Okay, so I can't actually shut down the server from an emacsclient command?
Apr 02 10:25:07 <Viking667>	Could I use this:  emacsclient -e "M-x kill-emacs"   ?
Apr 02 10:25:23 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, looks like the MITM can downgrade https connection and feed you bad packages.
Apr 02 10:25:24 <codingquark>	By adding some nullbytes or zeros or something to keep the package _size_ the same.
Apr 02 10:25:32 <twb>	codingquark: it's not HTTPS at all
Apr 02 10:26:00 <codingquark>	twb: even if it is, can be downgraded in cases.
Apr 02 10:26:17 <twb>	codingquark: basically it's that you hijack DNS and serve out a package index that has
Apr 02 10:26:24 <twb>	"SHA256Sum:  deadbeef"
Apr 02 10:26:26 <twb>	instead of
Apr 02 10:26:27 <twb>	"SHA256Sum: deadbeef"
Apr 02 10:26:43 <twb>	It's not a sum collision or anything, just shitty string parsing code in C
Apr 02 10:27:56 <codingquark>	Ah, I see!
Apr 02 10:28:02 *	Viking667 gives up and goes with M-x kill-emacs
Apr 02 10:28:08 <twb>	The padding it talks about is simply because the "File-Size: 1234b" type header is not vulnerable and is still validated
Apr 02 10:28:09 <Viking667>	Okay, thanks for your help.
Apr 02 10:28:22 <fledermaus>	https://mstdn.io/@sohkamyung/103927578883655708
Apr 02 10:28:23 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, that I gathered.
Apr 02 10:28:29 <twb>	It's standard to validate BOTH the sum and the size, to prevent padding attacks
Apr 02 10:29:04 <codingquark>	I mean it better be!
Apr 02 10:30:30 <twb>	codingquark: of course if you're clever you include the file size in the thing being summed
Apr 02 10:30:47 <twb>	codingquark: so that it's harder to fuck with
Apr 02 10:31:01 <twb>	codingquark: I don't remember the exact right way to do it, but e.g. Schneier's textbooks will tell you
Apr 02 10:31:52 <codingquark>	I got the book, I'll check it out, thanks man!
Apr 02 10:36:26 <codingquark>	wasamasa: urine therapy lol
Apr 02 10:36:35 <wasamasa>	yes, my grandpa did it
Apr 02 10:36:46 <wasamasa>	the whole place was filled with pee jars
Apr 02 10:36:53 <wasamasa>	sometimes they had lemon slices in them
Apr 02 10:37:24 <codingquark>	The analogy you drew is amazing.
Apr 02 10:37:53 <wasamasa>	my father did kvass occasionally and his stuff was dark brown
Apr 02 10:38:13 <wasamasa>	but then it also had a strong smell
Apr 02 10:40:38 <aidalgol>	aaaaaaand the TMI award of the year goes to...
Apr 02 10:40:57 <wasamasa>	I have an even worse story, just for you
Apr 02 10:41:34 <wasamasa>	at some point me and my mother had to live at the grandparents for a while and grandpa ran out of jars to fill
Apr 02 10:41:50 <wasamasa>	so he took a set of cups from my mother
Apr 02 10:42:34 <wasamasa>	when she discovered that, she took a cardboard box, filled it with the cups and put them outside on the street as a giveaway
Apr 02 10:42:35 <thblt>	shrysr: there's a built-in reveal plugin called multiplex, where a master presentation drives any number of slaves.  In practice, you give an URL to the students, and you scroll the slides for them while you talk.  
Apr 02 10:42:54 <wasamasa>	five minutes later the box was gone and to this day we laugh at the misfortune of whoever picked it up
Apr 02 10:44:54 <thblt>	maybe that person uses them for English tea, over which piss with a lemon slice is a net improvement.
Apr 02 10:45:13 <wasamasa>	:D
Apr 02 10:45:39 <aidalgol>	what did you label it as?
Apr 02 10:45:55 <wasamasa>	"Zu verschenken"
Apr 02 10:46:55 <wasamasa>	though, I'm not sure there was even a label on the box
Apr 02 10:47:15 <aidalgol>	You're all a bunch of evil bastards.  I'm going to bed.
Apr 02 10:49:45 <codingquark>	I don't know why I got disconnected, very sad.
Apr 02 10:50:38 <codingquark>	What function to use to quickly alternate between two buffers (something like "switch to the other buffer that I just switched from")
Apr 02 10:53:46 <codingquark>	Also, I've started using org-brain with a setup I deemed appropriate.
Apr 02 10:53:56 <kensanata>	codingquark: I have no idea but I know that C-x b runs ivy-switch-buffer on my system.
Apr 02 10:53:57 <codingquark>	Side effect is that I don't know where to jot down quick one-liners
Apr 02 10:54:34 <codingquark>	kensanata: that gives a list of recently opened buffers, right?
Apr 02 10:54:36 <kensanata>	codingquark: I have a ~/NOTES.org for all the messy stuff I can't file
Apr 02 10:55:04 <shrysr>	ty thblt thats interesting to know.
Apr 02 10:55:06 <codingquark>	kensanata: amazing, that is exactly what I have done! I considered it a "temporary measure" though.
Apr 02 10:55:15 <kensanata>	codingquark: it gives me completing of all the buffers and I guess the last one is highlighted by default so RET will do it.
Apr 02 10:55:42 <codingquark>	kensanata: yeah. What I want is a single function so that I can alternate between two buffers.
Apr 02 10:56:09 <kensanata>	More like a "permanent measure" as I hardly ever post-process it; eventually it's simply archived and I never look at the archive.
Apr 02 10:56:16 <codingquark>	Hmm, there is mode-line-other-buffer
Apr 02 10:57:16 <kensanata>	I don't understand what buffer-name-history contains.
Apr 02 10:58:43 <kensanata>	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SwitchingBuffers#toc5
Apr 02 10:59:51 <shrysr>	org-brain is great..it changed the way i learn stuff, but imo needs to be combined with something like org-journal or rough notes system. I use a modified version of scimax-journal. 
Apr 02 11:00:08 <codingquark>	kensanata: thanks!
Apr 02 11:00:36 <codingquark>	I've now bound it under exwm-input-set-key.
Apr 02 11:02:28 <jimmyjimjim>	hi all. Has anyone got magit/forge working with gitlab?  The docs get a little vague on this, but I think I've created the token, placed it in the right place (~/.authinfo). But Whenever I try to make use of forge, I get told that there is no digehode^forge token. Based on my google search, nobody else has a problem with this, or nobody out there is using gitlab and forge.
Apr 02 11:07:12 <benny>	jimmyjimjim: I just tried and I get cl-no-applicable-method: No applicable method: forge-get-repository, [....]
Apr 02 11:09:15 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Oh, wow. That sounds worse than my own issue ;)
Apr 02 11:09:50 <benny>	your issue sounds like the syntax for .authinfo isn't what forge expects
Apr 02 11:10:26 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: try evaluating (require 'forge). I don't know if magit drops the options for it forge isn;t loaded
Apr 02 11:10:58 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: that's what I thought, but I can't see an issue. I got forge to generate a token automatically for github and it matches my format
Apr 02 11:11:21 <benny>	it looks like forge is doing stuff, it's definitely using emacsql which magit (I think) doesn't do
Apr 02 11:11:36 <benny>	my authinfo: machine gitlab.com/api/v4 login bennya^forge password xxxx
Apr 02 11:11:42 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Or does it... whitespace-mode suggests the auto-generated one is tab delimited
Apr 02 11:12:31 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Nope. not that

Apr 02 11:12:52 <jimmyjimjim>	Mine is: machine gitlab.com/api/v4 login digehode^forge TOKENHERE
Apr 02 11:13:36 <thblt>	should the machine id takes a path component? 
Apr 02 11:14:11 <benny>	that looks wronger than what I have jimmyjimjim :P
Apr 02 11:14:11 <jimmyjimjim>	I'll try without. The few examples I found had it like that, but then they didn't seem towork for people either...
Apr 02 11:15:29 <benny>	I can't play around with my system at the moment, because it's right now at 21GB out of 16GB memory usage and not responsive ;-)
Apr 02 11:16:23 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: No worries. I think you might have spotted the problem :/
Apr 02 11:17:22 <jimmyjimjim>	FFS. I need to sleep. Sorry, I just used you to spot the typo in my file. I was convinced I had no mistakes and only seeing yours and comparing made me realise I missed the "password" keyword
Apr 02 11:18:05 <benny>	we've all been there :P
Apr 02 11:18:11 <benny>	good night
Apr 02 11:18:17 <jimmyjimjim>	Thanks :)
Apr 02 11:18:29 <benny>	even though my system is unresponsive I'm still flashed by the magit that is zram
Apr 02 11:18:34 <benny>	magic*
Apr 02 11:19:16 <benny>	I'm now at 24GB out of 16GB memory without using a disk backed swap
Apr 02 11:22:20 <thblt>	My RAM management solution is called Dell commercial practices, where when I bought my XPS 15, 32GB was cheaper than 16.
Apr 02 11:23:58 <benny>	unlucky for me I'm a thinkpad superfan and I live in Europe, so there nothing is cheap ;-)
Apr 02 11:27:07 <thblt>	My next laptop will be a reconditioned thinkpad I think.  I don't need the beefy laptop, I'd rather have a small ultraportable laptop and a beefy desktop.
Apr 02 11:27:50 <thblt>	Or even maybe a Surface tablet with a good external keyb
Apr 02 11:33:48 <benny>	keyboard is most important for me and then display, but I'm not a desktop kind of guy
Apr 02 11:59:59 <quiliro>	Hello
Apr 02 12:00:04 <quiliro>	Saluton!

Apr 02 13:46:56 <wasamasa>	apparently you can make kvass without yeast
Apr 02 13:47:09 <wasamasa>	just use some sauerkraut juice and wait a bit longer
Apr 02 13:50:56 <davemq>	I've made it with yeast, but using sauerkraut juice seems reasonable. Lacto fermentation vs. yeast fermentation
Apr 02 13:54:38 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: did you start the experiment?
Apr 02 13:55:16 <wgreenhouse>	most interesting aspect for us was finding the tiny temperature gradient within the house
Apr 02 13:55:20 <hodapp>	I thought kvass was lactobacillus fermentation, not yeast
Apr 02 13:55:26 <wgreenhouse>	warm spots where these fermentation projects go a little faster
Apr 02 13:55:44 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: the symbol kvass exists in multiple namespaces :)
Apr 02 13:56:02 <wgreenhouse>	there is bread kvass, which is yeast fermented, and there's e.g. beet kvass which is lactofermented veggie juice
Apr 02 13:56:11 <hodapp>	hmmm
Apr 02 13:56:22 <wgreenhouse>	bread kvass is like a near beer, basically
Apr 02 13:56:26 <wgreenhouse>	usually made from stale rye bread
Apr 02 13:56:44 <hodapp>	the US has breweries that do every other weird flavor. maybe they could start doing kvass too.
Apr 02 13:56:47 <hodapp>	instead of shitty IPAs
Apr 02 13:56:59 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, I think it could catch on in the states
Apr 02 13:57:08 <hodapp>	can you make it taste like pine trees?
Apr 02 13:57:26 <kensanata>	I recently started growing my own sourdough...
Apr 02 13:57:35 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: usually it has a deep yeasty funk. I think the market to peel off in .us would be kombucha-drinkers

Apr 02 13:58:48 <wgreenhouse>	I like to add some ginger to mine but that's slightly unorthodox
Apr 02 13:58:58 <wgreenhouse>	(ginger also speeds the fermentation as it's usually carrying a lot of yeast naturally)
Apr 02 14:00:47 <hodapp>	I've not made ginger beer in awhile but I had an older recipe that made pretty wonderful results. it was not exactly soda but not exactly beer either; it'd get to maybe ~1% alcohol

Apr 02 15:44:33 <offby1>	*sigh* I'd vaguely thought I'd be in NY this May
Apr 02 15:44:34 <offby1>	guess not

Apr 02 15:45:13 <grym>	but otherwise quite russian indeed 
Apr 02 15:45:20 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: me too, I was commenting earlier I don't know why it hasn't caught on in .us to compete with kombucha for all these hippie drinkers of probiotic live cultured beverages
Apr 02 15:45:31 <isBEKaml>	grym: Brigton and Yarmouth are mostly rich Russians or rich retirees
Apr 02 15:45:34 <wgreenhouse>	we can compete with kombucha on garbage-taste
Apr 02 15:45:40 <wasamasa>	my father experimented with all kinds of fruit in it
Apr 02 15:45:41 <offby1>	I think I had kvass once.  It was fizzy.
Apr 02 15:46:00 <grym>	wgreenhouse: my mother in law is still kind of incredulous that kombucha is A Thing.  "what?  the thing we used to do at dacha to make tea last longer? you idiots are drinking that now?"

Apr 02 15:48:58 <offby1>	grym: heh indeed
Apr 02 15:49:18 <offby1>	that appeals to my ... snobbishness?  Reverse-snobbisheness?  Something anyway
Apr 02 15:49:33 <grym>	my inlaws are pretty fun 
Apr 02 15:49:39 <grym>	my extended inlaws .. less so 
Apr 02 15:50:55 <grym>	their kids all came out OK though, so that's good 
Apr 02 15:51:24 <wasamasa>	offby1: the kvass is making fizzy noises at the back of my room
Apr 02 15:51:52 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: so, how do you tell it's done fermenting, when the raisins turned into grapes again?
Apr 02 15:52:05 <wgreenhouse>	lolol
Apr 02 15:52:55 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: I think I just decided it was done by sight/taste, then bottled it
Apr 02 15:52:57 <hmw>	kensanata: Why does the water from boiling potatoes work as a starting point? Shouldn't life be mostly dead in that? Or is it used because of the starch and the bacteria come from somewhere else?
Apr 02 15:53:25 <hodapp>	I keep forgetting that salt-risen bread is a thing, and it requires no yeast.
Apr 02 15:53:32 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: if you did the raisin thing, there is some folklore about the raisins floating to the top
Apr 02 15:53:39 <wasamasa>	they are already there
Apr 02 15:53:54 <hodapp>	I have heard of people making wine out of raisins but never tried it
Apr 02 15:53:58 <wgreenhouse>	maybe try a taste tomorrow and see how it is
Apr 02 15:54:09 <wgreenhouse>	it is probably already funkier than store-bought
Apr 02 15:54:14 <wgreenhouse>	esp since you're using that beer yeast
Apr 02 15:54:40 <wasamasa>	well, not exactly
Apr 02 15:54:50 <wasamasa>	honey mead yeast, with a bulldog on the packaging
Apr 02 15:55:01 <wgreenhouse>	oh interesting
Apr 02 15:55:01 <wasamasa>	this can only go well
Apr 02 15:55:05 <wgreenhouse>	hahahah
Apr 02 15:56:19 <wasamasa>	boris has a tutorial for honey mead, too
Apr 02 15:56:45 <wgreenhouse>	yup
Apr 02 15:56:46 <grym>	hmw: it'll have a bunch of starch to eat and it's sterile.  then you add yeasties 
Apr 02 15:57:02 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: but regardless I think your timescale is probably compressed compared with using bread yeast
Apr 02 15:57:06 <grym>	wasamasa: mead mead 
Apr 02 15:57:21 <grym>	wasamasa: are you sure these are the right kind of bees, though? 
Apr 02 15:59:08 <hmw>	grym: Hm, from where? I guess the bacteria comes from the air, just like in the process of brewing some sorts of beer? In that case, water from boiling rice or any other starch should work as well.
Apr 02 15:59:16 <wasamasa>	https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07HJ3B3V4/
Apr 02 15:59:28 <grym>	hmw: yeah, any starchy water would be fine.  You'd add the yeast once the wort's cooled a bit 
Apr 02 15:59:39 <grym>	(if you have some brewer's yeast)
Apr 02 15:59:59 <wasamasa>	I've tried a teaspoon, there's definitely alcohol in it
Apr 02 16:00:34 <wgreenhouse>	it is basically up to you how far to go. mostly stops when bottled
Apr 02 16:00:56 <wgreenhouse>	if you go longer it will be less sweet and more boozy/funky
Apr 02 16:08:57 <wasamasa>	alright, I'll wait one more day and filter it into other jars
Apr 02 16:09:10 <wasamasa>	I'm just afraid filtering will undo the fizziness :<
Apr 02 16:10:28 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: as long as you don't extract all the yeast when bottling, it will still be very fizzy
Apr 02 16:10:35 <wgreenhouse>	to the point that it will make you a little nervous when opening
Apr 02 16:11:00 <grym>	friend of mine made us 5 gallons of mead with champagne yeast when i got married 
Apr 02 16:11:07 <grym>	and you need to wire the bottles shut 
Apr 02 16:11:14 <wgreenhouse>	hah
Apr 02 16:11:28 <grym>	it bottle conditions, so the first ones were SWEEET to the point of being kind of gross 
Apr 02 16:12:09 <grym>	5 months in the fridge produced a dry mead that was actually palatable! but we lost 1/3 of each bottle when we opened it, and the pressure was enough to send the cork from the third floor balcony about halfway across the back yard
Apr 02 16:12:15 <grym>	a fun trick at parties.
Apr 02 16:12:20 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 02 16:12:26 <kqr>	When I run e.g. describe-function, it does something very neat with windows: if there's only one window open, it splits the frame into two windows and uses one of the windows to display the documentation. If there are already two windows, it simply uses the other window. I would like one of my commands to do this as well – any pointers on how I can accomplish that?
Apr 02 16:12:39 <kqr>	(I feel like there is a built-in function that does just that, but I have not been able to find it.)
Apr 02 16:12:40 <grym>	we took to opening the last few bottles outdoors and pointed well away from us 
Apr 02 16:12:54 <grym>	the corks needed to be touched only slightly and then they'd uncork themselves
Apr 02 16:12:54 <wasamasa>	speaking of booze, I think my relatives still have that saber-shaped bottle of cognac
Apr 02 16:14:02 <grym>	wasamasa: https://youtu.be/sWJkIxnaUkg?t=1m31s
Apr 02 16:14:21 <grym>	pro tip, don't do this 
Apr 02 16:14:29 <wgreenhouse>	kqr: the main entry point is `display-buffer' which has some rather arcane rules
Apr 02 16:16:33 <wasamasa>	grym: lol, how do these people even survive
Apr 02 16:16:58 <grym>	alton's delightful 
Apr 02 16:17:09 <grym>	but sabering things is derpy as hell :D 
Apr 02 16:17:37 <wasamasa>	naturally there's kalashnikov-shaped vodka, too
Apr 02 16:18:09 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: I think that stuff is even licensed by the Kalashnikov family
Apr 02 16:18:16 <wgreenhouse>	with knock-offs, of course
Apr 02 16:37:09 *	hodapp blinks
Apr 02 16:37:24 <hodapp>	apparently my phone's camera records video in 3840x2160 120fps by default.
Apr 02 16:37:31 <hodapp>	this seems like a tad bit of overkill.
Apr 02 16:41:19 <notzmv>	just a bit
Apr 02 16:41:43 <notzmv>	gotta have high quality tiktoks with today's youth
Apr 02 16:41:46 <notzmv>	:^)
Apr 02 16:44:08 <kqr>	wgreenhouse, thank you, that was helpful!
Apr 02 16:44:38 <wasamasa>	speaking of the topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fslh2h/dbc_control_how_and_where_to_open_buffers/
Apr 02 16:44:57 <wasamasa>	the author of that thing didn't seem as enthusiastic as me :D
Apr 02 17:53:10 <excelsiora>	can I just put `emacs --daemon` like that in my bashrc?
Apr 02 17:53:40 <wasamasa>	if anything, in .bash_profile
Apr 02 17:54:54 <excelsiora>	it's a little verbose because of spacemacs
Apr 02 17:56:26 <excelsiora>	wasn't there supposed to be a new standard where we would put our dotfiles, like in a .config directory or something?
Apr 02 17:56:43 <wasamasa>	yes, XDG
Apr 02 17:57:00 <excelsiora>	is that still relevant for a server?
Apr 02 17:57:12 <wasamasa>	it's relevant for config files
Apr 02 17:57:59 <excelsiora>	were we also going to put our e.g. .emacs.d and .vimrc in there as well?
Apr 02 17:58:07 <wasamasa>	it replaces .emacs.d
Apr 02 17:58:31 <wasamasa>	vim doesn't follow that standard
Apr 02 17:58:33 <excelsiora>	does emacs look there now?
Apr 02 17:58:39 <wasamasa>	as of emacs 27, yes
Apr 02 17:58:57 <excelsiora>	ok, who's going to tell the vim guys?
Apr 02 17:59:08 <wasamasa>	vim is a one man effort, lol
Apr 02 17:59:13 <wasamasa>	if anything, neovim does it
Apr 02 17:59:30 <Twist>	Well, that's sexy.
Apr 02 17:59:53 <Twist>	hodapp: Have you seen ox-twbs yet?
Apr 02 18:00:03 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: to really be XDG-compliant we ought to split out ~/.config/emacs from ~/.cache/emacs
Apr 02 18:00:13 <wgreenhouse>	I assume that nobody has thought that far
Apr 02 18:00:16 <wasamasa>	hence why neovim calls it partial support
Apr 02 18:00:31 <hodapp>	Twist: is that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2?
Apr 02 18:00:45 <wasamasa>	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/ieoldm29ymM
Apr 02 18:01:04 <excelsiora>	k, I love you guys but I have to reboot so take care!! :P
Apr 02 18:01:21 <JordiGH>	Oh good.
Apr 02 18:01:23 <Twist>	hodapp: No, but it will infect your orgmode html export with bootstrap.
Apr 02 18:01:32 <JordiGH>	I thought for a moment you were going to halt.
Apr 02 18:01:36 <hodapp>	Twist: Hmmmm. I was already trying to get my org-mode stuff to coexist with Hugo.
Apr 02 18:01:38 <JordiGH>	Sounded like a suicide note there.
Apr 02 18:03:22 <Twist>	Looks like there's an ox-hugo too.
Apr 02 18:03:38 *	Twist loses 10 minutes exploring Hugo.
Apr 02 18:03:39 <fsbot>	oops,  Bad bounding indices: 10, 0
Apr 02 18:04:16 <hodapp>	Twist: https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/333 there's me
Apr 02 18:05:17 <hodapp>	and I admit that that is at least 50% my fault for feeding it really ugly org documents, and I'd gladly fix them, except that I keep running into things like this and I have to basically do a manual binary tree search to find the offending lines
Apr 02 18:05:36 <ngz>	hodapp: Does M-x org-lint help?
Apr 02 18:06:10 <hodapp>	ngz: trying it now. As far as org care, the file is fine.
Apr 02 18:10:46 <bpalmer>	Let's insist our conversations respect transaction atomicity and consistency.
Apr 02 18:11:54 <bpalmer>	rudybot: however, durability is optional in a two party consent state.
Apr 02 18:12:11 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I've been pretty pleased w/ the durability of my unibody mbp
Apr 02 18:13:17 <hodapp>	ngz: thanks, this found some things that may or may not matter but deserve attention anyway
Apr 02 18:17:47 <lxsameer>	hey folks, is it possible to get access to the file name and the line number where a macro is being called within the macro
Apr 02 18:27:46 <wasamasa>	,tias
Apr 02 18:27:47 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 02 18:28:03 <wasamasa>	I suspect it isn't
Apr 02 18:29:10 <rpav>	if elisp backtraces are anything to go by, it doesn't store that info at *all* ;/
Apr 02 18:29:17 <wasamasa>	in my test it returns the location of point when evaluating the macro
Apr 02 18:30:26 <wasamasa>	when compiling, the location of the end of the enclosing form
Apr 02 18:31:16 <rpav>	wait, waht gives you that?
Apr 02 18:31:25 <wasamasa>	http://ix.io/2gns
Apr 02 18:31:47 <wasamasa>	bonus: both calls of the macro returns return the same thing
Apr 02 18:31:48 <rpav>	oh bah that's not going to do it ;)
Apr 02 18:32:00 <wasamasa>	of course, but lxsameer needs something to start with
Apr 02 18:32:06 <rpav>	you don't want buffer-related things, you'd need metadata from the reader
Apr 02 18:33:50 <wasamasa>	it's still funny, shows a bit about how the interpreter works
Apr 02 18:34:15 <wasamasa>	read a form, advance point, eval it, repeat
Apr 02 18:34:47 <wasamasa>	you could probably use it as debugging help just fine
Apr 02 18:34:55 <rpav>	yeah that can definitely help demonstrate what-happens-when
Apr 02 18:37:21 <wasamasa>	I could imagine someone hacking things up to the degree of guessing for you which line the error occurred at :D
Apr 02 18:43:42 <rpav>	*actually* .. i think the info might mostly be there, but not accessible from lisp and/or too late
Apr 02 18:48:39 <rpav>	whoa. you sortof can.
Apr 02 18:49:02 <wasamasa>	I await your insights with baited breath
Apr 02 18:49:50 <rpav>	https://gist.github.com/rpav/615b876a3ec6eb85499cbf6939ca23dc
Apr 02 18:50:33 <wasamasa>	interesting
Apr 02 18:50:37 <rpav>	i was looking in read / read_internal_start and notice Vread_symbol_positions_list .. which seemed like it mihgt be a defvar from the name, and is 
Apr 02 18:50:52 <rpav>	that doesn't get you file, but it does get some vaguely interesting reader info
Apr 02 18:51:08 <wasamasa>	it's not in the elisp reference
Apr 02 18:52:31 <wasamasa>	the thing is that you don't want to permanently enable this
Apr 02 18:53:42 <wasamasa>	it's used by compile-defun
Apr 02 18:54:53 <rpav>	bah load has a Vloads_in_progress but it doesn't look usefully accessible
Apr 02 18:55:06 <rpav>	yeah but if you're just debugging, a let or something mgiht be sufficient
Apr 02 18:56:53 <rpav>	aha! current-load-list
Apr 02 18:57:27 <rpav>	put a `(message "%s" current-load-list)` in like, /tmp/foo.el, and (load "/tmp/foo.el") it
Apr 02 18:58:07 <rpav>	the stuff in read-symbol-positions-list just looks like it's offset from the current toplevel form though so not quite 100% 
Apr 02 18:59:00 <nikitamog>	Heyo, folks.
Apr 02 19:02:33 <nikitamog>	I'm having the worst time getting emacs to recognize my fonts.

Apr 02 22:11:52 <bandali>	on emacs-26.3, with the above htmlize library, i get:
Apr 02 22:11:55 <bandali>	cons: Args out of range: "interactive", -1, 0
Apr 02 22:11:59 <bandali>	when doing M-x scpaste RET
Apr 02 22:12:06 <bandali>	scpaste-region seems to work just fine tho
Apr 02 22:13:32 <bandali>	anyone able to reproduce?
Apr 02 22:15:58 <rpav>	ah, find-file-at-point .. sometimes the little things make all the difference
Apr 02 22:15:59 <bandali>	ha, but it works fine with the old htmlize technomancy uses
Apr 02 22:16:20 <technomancy>	never upgrade!
Apr 02 22:16:31 <bandali>	LOL
Apr 02 22:16:48 <bandali>	technomancy, would you consider tho? :-p
Apr 02 22:17:35 <technomancy>	bandali: I think I'd rather move to htmlfontify than upgrade htmlize if something has to change
Apr 02 22:17:42 <nikitamog>	Miyu-saki: What part of fc-list output is the font name that the system recognizes?
Apr 02 22:17:54 <nikitamog>	'/home/nikita/.local/share/fonts/Input_Fonts/InputMono/InputMono/InputMono-Light.ttf: Input Mono,InputMono Light:style=Light,Regular'
Apr 02 22:18:27 <nikitamog>	That works fine on my ubuntu right here and it's exactly the same in gentoo.
Apr 02 22:18:55 <bandali>	ha
Apr 02 22:20:15 <technomancy>	bandali: unfortunately it's still pretty gross with htmlfontify https://p.hagelb.org/scpaste-new.el.html
Apr 02 22:21:18 <Miyu-saki>	nikitamog: Have you tried `InputMono Light`?
Apr 02 22:21:24 <bandali>	god damn it, why doesn't it use a monospace type face
Apr 02 22:21:27 <Miyu-saki>	Or well, `Input Mono:style=light`
Apr 02 22:24:16 <bandali>	hm, actually, it looks way better on my end, with emacs-26.3
Apr 02 22:25:04 <technomancy>	huh, scp can copy both files in a single shot instead of invoking two scp commands
Apr 02 22:25:11 <technomancy>	why the heck didn't I do that ages ago?
Apr 02 22:25:12 <nikitamog>	Miyu-saki: I'm trying a bunch of different chunks and it still throws undefined at me. I'll try something that isn't a ttf I provided.
Apr 02 22:25:53 <udbhav>	I'm trying to learn how to make decisions on when/if I should normalize a large table with varchar fields that are used for categorization purposes, any resources you could point me to?
Apr 02 22:26:49 <bandali>	technomancy, htmlize-buffer: https://p.bndl.org htmlfontify-buffer: https://p.bndl.org/scpaste.el.html
Apr 02 22:26:55 <ecbrown>	udbhav: #postgresql?
Apr 02 22:27:01 <bandali>	technomancy, the latter looks nearly identical to what i see in emacs itself :-)
Apr 02 22:27:27 <udbhav>	lol whoops, wrong tab haha
Apr 02 22:27:30 <udbhav>	thank you
Apr 02 22:27:41 <ecbrown>	udbhav: though a more serious answer is, always maximize normalization until it hurts
Apr 02 22:27:55 <technomancy>	bandali: the latter looks really bad here
Apr 02 22:27:56 <ecbrown>	at least, according to the Codd-Date school
Apr 02 22:27:57 <udbhav>	thanks, that's helpful
Apr 02 22:28:19 <ecbrown>	it's not always easy, because database tables are often times part of an implementaiton
Apr 02 22:28:21 <technomancy>	bandali: the non-colored symbols are in a completely different font
Apr 02 22:28:24 <bandali>	technomancy, the html file on my server? can you give a screenshot? i'll give you one in a sec
Apr 02 22:29:00 <ecbrown>	udbhav: and unfortunately from a Relational Theory point of view, optimization is different than the concerns of the calculus. 
Apr 02 22:29:41 <technomancy>	bandali: yeah https://p.hagelb.org/htmlfontify.png
Apr 02 22:29:54 <technomancy>	I mean... not *really* bad, but still definitely wrong
Apr 02 22:30:15 <udbhav>	ecbrown: lost me a bit, what do you mean by the tables being a part of the implementation?
Apr 02 22:30:53 <ecbrown>	udbhav: there's a mantra "de-normalize for performance"
Apr 02 22:31:19 <ecbrown>	but that catches up to you in design: you end up having to GROUP BY or DISTINCT every darned time
Apr 02 22:31:27 <bandali>	technomancy, are they really in a different font?
Apr 02 22:31:31 <bandali>	here's what i see btw: https://p.bndl.org/scpaste.el.png
Apr 02 22:31:55 <ecbrown>	really SQL should not need to have DISTINCT: rows should always be unique and therefore normalized
Apr 02 22:32:06 <technomancy>	bandali: yes, definitely a different size; possibly the same face
Apr 02 22:32:08 <udbhav>	gotcha, thanks, that makes sense
Apr 02 22:32:22 <udbhav>	i'm gonna... add an index
Apr 02 22:32:23 <ecbrown>	cheers 
Apr 02 22:32:49 <bandali>	technomancy, in the screenshot you gave, can you point to two example differences? also, can you double check with firefox's Inspect Element?
Apr 02 22:33:30 <technomancy>	bandali: scpaste-el-location is several pixels shorter than replace-regexp-in-string, for instance
Apr 02 22:35:26 <technomancy>	bandali: the inspector refuses to tell me the font size of replace-regexp-in-string; when I click it, it says "no element selected"
Apr 02 22:36:21 <bandali>	technomancy, ha, that'd be because replace-regexp-in-string is part of the text of its containing element (the pre, i believe) rather than in a span, like scpaste-el-location is
Apr 02 22:37:02 <technomancy>	anyway the fonts are clearly inconsistent
Apr 02 22:37:14 <bandali>	right
Apr 02 22:37:17 <technomancy>	plus htmlfontify encodes COPYRIGHT SIGN as Â©
Apr 02 22:37:19 <bandali>	let me see if i can pin down the issue
Apr 02 22:37:25 <bandali>	yeah, that's an encoding issue
Apr 02 22:37:34 <bandali>	same with el files on your server
Apr 02 22:37:46 <bandali>	e.g. https://p.hagelb.org/index
Apr 02 22:38:20 <technomancy>	ah, so maybe that's an issue with HTTP headers sent by the server
Apr 02 22:38:25 <technomancy>	but still, htmlize works fine
Apr 02 22:38:55 <bandali>	right. or maybe htmlfontify needs some tweaking
Apr 02 22:39:03 <bandali>	shouldn't be a big deal
Apr 02 22:44:07 <bandali>	the reason for different fonts is that the styles set on <body> don't apply to <pre>, at least not all of them
Apr 02 22:44:19 <bandali>	looking to see if it's something easily fixable within htmlfontify
Apr 02 22:44:49 <technomancy>	problem is htmlfontify ships with emacs, so fixing it takes years =(
Apr 02 22:45:51 <bandali>	i wonder if i could get it in for emacs-27
Apr 02 22:46:17 <bandali>	but yeah, it'll take a while for those on debian, redhat, ..., and that don't compile their own emacs
Apr 02 22:46:22 <bandali>	e.g. you, i guess :-p
Apr 02 22:46:52 <bandali>	the culprit is in hfy-sprintf-stylesheet btw
Apr 02 23:16:45 <danielboston26>	Hi i am trying to run slime when i do i get an error saying no such file or directory lisp
Apr 02 23:18:42 <technomancy>	did you ... install common lisp?
Apr 02 23:19:15 <danielboston26>	yes
Apr 02 23:19:18 <danielboston26>	sbcl
Apr 02 23:19:23 <danielboston26>	i can run it fine
Apr 02 23:19:57 <danielboston26>	when i tried setq inferior lisp sbcl that didn't work either
Apr 02 23:20:36 <technomancy>	inferior lisp is for the built-in thing; slime has a different defvar
Apr 02 23:20:46 <technomancy>	not sure what it's called; slime-something-command probably
Apr 02 23:21:27 <danielboston26>	anyone know?
Apr 02 23:22:17 <danielboston26>	its (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/local/bin/sbcl --noinform")
Apr 02 23:22:50 <danielboston26>	idk what --noinform does but that fixed it
Apr 02 23:23:55 <markasoftware>	"suppress the printing of any banner or other informational message at startup."
Apr 02 23:24:01 <technomancy>	inferior-lisp isn't slime
Apr 02 23:24:12 <technomancy>	slime is superior lisp interaction method for emacs
Apr 02 23:26:27 <technomancy>	literally the opposite of inferior lisp =)
Apr 02 23:35:14 <hodapp>	technomancy: by the way, when you posted a week or two ago the Racket REPL in Emacs with inline images, how does one achieve that support?
Apr 02 23:36:07 <technomancy>	hodapp: I was using racket-mode; I think geiser.el supports it too
Apr 02 23:36:16 <hodapp>	it just understands how to do images?
Apr 02 23:36:46 <technomancy>	I think it probably tells racket to base64-encode them or something? not sure of the implementation details
Apr 02 23:36:50 <technomancy>	but greghendershott would know =)

Apr 03 09:24:35 <jcay>	hey, guys, I am a little lost, where do I find/create the configuration file for emacs on debian?? it has ~/.emacs.d/ but it's a dir and only has auto-save stuff. I tried ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but it doesn't seem to work ;/
Apr 03 09:25:11 <thblt>	It's ~/.emacs.d/init.el
Apr 03 09:25:23 <thblt>	,doesntwork
Apr 03 09:25:24 <fsbot>	We can help you with your problem better if your error description is more informative than "it doesn't work"
Apr 03 09:30:10 <jcay>	I am a very n00b here, tried "(setq custom-tab-width 4)" but it still does what it wants
Apr 03 09:32:15 <thblt>	custom-tab-width isn't a variable.
Apr 03 09:32:54 <thblt>	You probably meant (setq-default tab-width 4)
Apr 03 09:35:05 <jcay>	ah, now it does what I want, thanks
Apr 03 09:58:40 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: computation disconnected because custom-tab-width exploded
Apr 03 09:58:41 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I wonder if the gas plant that exploded earlier did more real damage
Apr 03 10:01:34 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: all plants need carbon dioxide gas for photo synthesis
Apr 03 10:01:37 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Aura_OMI_Nitrogen_dioxide_troposphere_column.png <-- China
Apr 03 10:05:39 <thblt>	Is there a way to get the (future) value of server-name in init.el with emacs --daemon=name?
Apr 03 10:07:13 <thblt>	after-init-hook doesn't work.
Apr 03 11:09:56 <fledermaus>	have you tried turning your jet liner off and then on again: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/
Apr 03 11:46:34 <thblt>	What's a bit surprising is that it seems to imply aircrafts aren't powered off after each flight.
Apr 03 11:57:30 <siraben>	Has anyone had the issue with C-c C-p C-s [preview-section] in AucTeX causing mark to activate and select a region?
Apr 03 12:00:31 <siraben>	OTOH,  C-c C-p C-d [preview-document] works as intended, without weird selections
Apr 03 12:12:34 <quiliro>	Would anyone please check on https://termbin.com/msxq if the commented contents assign the same value to the date variable as the non-commented ones?
Apr 03 12:16:50 <quiliro>	Would the original (commented) date assignment be more clean code?
Apr 03 12:17:22 <quiliro>	Or is my latest modification (uncommented) good praactice?
Apr 03 12:27:38 <wasamasa>	neither are assignments
Apr 03 12:28:54 <wasamasa>	you could even make three bindings out of that
Apr 03 12:29:26 <wasamasa>	you start with something resembling a timestamp, then split on "T", then join
Apr 03 12:29:57 <wasamasa>	it's hard to tell what's going on since the format of the data is unknown and the variable names aren't descriptive
Apr 03 12:30:32 <wasamasa>	if I had to guess, you have a timestamp of the <date>T<time> form and want to convert it to the <date>-<time> form
Apr 03 12:35:50 <wasamasa>	or perhaps you want to turn <date> into something where the dashes have been replaced with slashes
Apr 03 12:36:29 <wasamasa>	in which case it would be better to have a datetime variable, a date variable, then use `replace-regexp-in-string' on it
Apr 03 12:40:27 <quiliro>	This is the whole file https://termbin.com/pnvo
Apr 03 12:40:52 <quiliro>	dashes to slashes , yes
Apr 03 12:41:16 <quiliro>	<date>T<time> to <date>
Apr 03 12:42:32 <quiliro>	wasamasa: So you think that using several variables is better (as in the commented area) than just assigning everything to one variable?
Apr 03 12:42:51 <wasamasa>	yes, it makes it easier to follow what's going on
Apr 03 12:43:05 <quiliro>	Thank you for your suggestion
Apr 03 12:43:12 <quiliro>	s
Apr 03 12:43:40 <quiliro>	will try to use replace-regexp-in-string
Apr 03 12:44:04 <quiliro>	and will try to use datetime variable
Apr 03 12:44:18 <quiliro>	any other suggestion?
Apr 03 12:45:11 <wasamasa>	you use two different ways of formatting let bindings
Apr 03 12:45:33 <quiliro>	datetime , date , newdate
Apr 03 12:45:39 <quiliro>	what do you mean?
Apr 03 12:46:11 <wasamasa>	look at the let forms in your example and you'll see
Apr 03 12:48:39 <wasamasa>	in one you're putting the value always on a new line, in the other it's on the same line as the variable
Apr 03 12:49:05 <wasamasa>	that aside, I have doubts your regex-replace search will actually replace anything
Apr 03 12:49:10 <wasamasa>	$ has a special meaning in regex
Apr 03 12:49:25 <wasamasa>	you'd have to use \\$ if you want to match dollar signs
Apr 03 12:50:01 <quiliro>	ok...I thought it did...maybe I added it manually to the result....nice observation
Apr 03 12:50:37 <wasamasa>	and all that stuff ends up in the current buffer
Apr 03 12:50:46 <wasamasa>	oh no, it doesn't
Apr 03 12:51:10 <wasamasa>	so no more plans to do CSV?
Apr 03 12:51:45 <quiliro>	no... the intention was to make it work with ledger-mode...
Apr 03 12:51:54 <quiliro>	ledger has a csv importer
Apr 03 12:52:18 <wasamasa>	then I'm looking forward how that mapping will be done :>
Apr 03 12:52:19 <quiliro>	that is why I thought it would be good to make a CSV
Apr 03 12:52:43 <quiliro>	but this script imports it directly......it works
Apr 03 12:53:04 <quiliro>	I have still to work on it more though
Apr 03 12:53:15 <quiliro>	BBIAW
Apr 03 13:29:48 <quiliro>	wasamasa: Which is bad, to put the values on the same line as the variable or to put them on another line?
Apr 03 13:30:13 <quiliro>	s/,/:/
Apr 03 13:47:15 <wasamasa>	quiliro: look at other elisp code and tell me :>
Apr 03 14:04:17 <quiliro>	wasamasa: esxml--css-selector-token-matchers shows the values of variables on the same lines as their names.
Apr 03 14:04:30 <quiliro>	will inspect code from others too
Apr 03 14:05:40 <quiliro>	checked all of esxml-query.el and it has that same practice on all let s-exps
Apr 03 14:06:24 <quiliro>	except when they are too long
Apr 03 14:12:35 <quiliro>	last statement is false
Apr 03 14:12:49 <quiliro>	there are no long variable assignments
Apr 03 14:13:02 <wasamasa>	truly a mystery
Apr 03 14:13:13 <quiliro>	on esxml-query.el
Apr 03 14:13:16 <jamik>	Hello friends, I often use `auto-fill-mode` for writing text documents but when I go back to edit previous lines I mess up the width of those lines. I've been tragically fixing this manually for a while but since I'm writing more these days I need a better solution. Particularly, is there a way to take a block of lines and run some command to remove/insert newlines such that each line follows the rule that `auto-fill-mode` would use?
Apr 03 14:13:27 <wasamasa>	anyway, this document applies to lisp coding in general: https://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/style.txt
Apr 03 14:14:43 <quiliro>	ok wasamasa that is better than irony :-)
Apr 03 14:16:15 <wasamasa>	there's similar tips in the elisp reference
Apr 03 14:16:38 <quiliro>	ok...have a lot of homewerk then :-)
Apr 03 14:18:43 <hmw>	jamik: Esc q in the paragraph might be what you are looking for
Apr 03 14:20:50 <jamik>	Wow, works like a charm, thanks hmw!
Apr 03 14:22:05 <quiliro>	,fill
Apr 03 14:22:05 <fsbot>	whoops,  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (str) (let ((temp-buffer (generate-new-buffer " *temp*"))) (save-current-buffer (set-buffer temp-buffer) (unwind-protect (progn (insert str) (let ((fill-column fsi-internal-fill-column)) (text-mode) (fill-region (point-min) (point-max)) (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))) (and (buffer-name temp-buffer) (kill-buffer temp-buffer)))))), 0
Apr 03 14:22:27 <quiliro>	what is fill paragraph?
Apr 03 14:24:07 <quiliro>	fill-paragraph' describe-funciton says "Fill paragraph at or after point.". It is a definition using the same word.
Apr 03 14:26:07 <wasamasa>	hard-wrap text using the value of fill-column
Apr 03 14:26:11 <wasamasa>	check the emacs manual for more
Apr 03 14:26:55 <jamik>	Fill paragraph is exactly what I was looking for in my question above quiliro 
Apr 03 14:27:01 <quiliro>	I have noticed i must read Emacs manual, Emacs Lisp Introduction and Emacs Lisp manual completely before asking further questions.
Apr 03 14:27:16 <wasamasa>	no, just the parts relevant to your questions
Apr 03 14:27:29 <quiliro>	ok...nice shortcut!
Apr 03 14:27:47 <quiliro>	But it would be good to read them completely too
Apr 03 14:27:58 <jamik>	Basically if the lines in a paragraph are shorter or longer than the value in `fill-column` it will resolve that for the entire paragraph.
Apr 03 14:28:44 <jamik>	I think it might take you a very long time to scour every manual page for emacs but more power to you!
Apr 03 15:15:10 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: to "fill" means to insert newlines into the paragraph so that lines are not longer than `fill-column'
Apr 03 15:28:53 <wasamasa>	quiliro: I have my doubts anyone read the whole thing fully
Apr 03 15:29:01 <wasamasa>	quiliro: maybe if they were really bored and had a month off
Apr 03 15:39:02 <rnkn>	whoa
Apr 03 15:39:05 <rnkn>	lotta users online
Apr 03 15:39:27 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: the kvass experiment is nearing its completion, I wonder how long to refrigerate the brew to ensure the yeast is inactive
Apr 03 15:41:11 <rnkn>	anyone know if there's a legit comparable alternative to fastmail?
Apr 03 15:42:20 <wasamasa>	snailmail??
Apr 03 15:42:20 <fsbot>	Reply unclear, try again
Apr 03 15:44:36 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: yeasts are wimpy about cold. most fermentation will stop pretty quickly (in a few hours), though they will continue to produce some CO2 for a longer tail (so you should use good bottles/jars designed for brewing or for holding carbonated liquids)
Apr 03 15:44:57 <rnkn>	"Snail Mail My Email is a worldwide community art project where volunteers handwrite strangers' emails and send physical letters to the intended recipients, free of charge." - snailmailmyemail.org
Apr 03 15:45:02 <wgreenhouse>	(except for lager yeasts which are weird and like cold)
Apr 03 15:45:18 <wasamasa>	alright, then I'll give it a try this evening
Apr 03 15:45:22 <codingquark>	wassup peeps?
Apr 03 15:46:58 <codingquark>	The lowest it gets here is 4°C
Apr 03 15:47:20 <codingquark>	At night only, for 2 hours/day, for one month a year.
Apr 03 15:47:36 <codingquark>	Should give a lot of time for yeast cultures.
Apr 03 15:48:02 <wasamasa>	I'm curious about the beets version with sauerkraut that doesn't use any yeast at all
Apr 03 15:48:11 <wasamasa>	naturally it looks less like apple juice
Apr 03 15:49:07 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, that is a lactofermented drink
Apr 03 15:49:24 <wgreenhouse>	based on the bacteria from the sauerkraut and the freeriders on the beets themselves
Apr 03 15:50:31 <wgreenhouse>	it is also a base for sauces and braises
Apr 03 15:50:53 <codingquark>	Do lactobacilli change taste? By how much?
Apr 03 15:51:16 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: typically they make things sour or tart
Apr 03 15:51:26 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 03 15:51:35 <wgreenhouse>	but it depends on the strain, and what they're working on
Apr 03 15:54:17 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: there are lactofermented soups that you can use beet kvass for
Apr 03 15:56:49 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: yogurt and kefir and the like are mostly lacto-fermentation
Apr 03 15:58:14 <codingquark>	wgreenhouse: well, I imagine kvass will taste very different from yogurt though?
Apr 03 15:59:07 <wgreenhouse>	bread kvass is mostly yeast fermentation (though there will be some incidental presence of lactobacilli if you're using a sour rye bread, which is the traditional way)
Apr 03 15:59:34 <wgreenhouse>	so it is more "beery" though it has its own hard to describe flavor

Apr 03 20:50:37 <aidalgol>	white_magic: I agree VSCode does a lot of things right, but I really hate JetBrains' IDEs.
Apr 03 20:50:50 <aidalgol>	Not as much as I hate Visual Studio, but close.
Apr 03 20:51:21 <white_magic>	aidalgol: personally, I'm not even well-versed in the JB IDEs but I know and have tried some of their refactoring abilities. The level of intuition the have on the code is unparalleled.
Apr 03 20:51:41 <white_magic>	aidalgol: imho Visual Studio is a damn fine IDE. Not unixy in any shape or form, though, of course.
Apr 03 20:51:54 <white_magic>	The most you can do is add vim bindings to it
Apr 03 20:52:21 <white_magic>	But if you haven't used Visual Studio in some years, you would be surprised how far along it has come
Apr 03 20:52:35 <white_magic>	fuzzy file searching, much better refactoring abilities
Apr 03 20:52:42 <white_magic>	I would argue it's more performant and stable, too
Apr 03 20:54:00 <grym>	i use vs for c#, pycharm for big python, and emacs for the rest of the world 
Apr 03 20:54:07 <aidalgol>	Last version I used was Visual Studio 2017.  Yes, it's come a long way, but soooo much of the UI is garbage.
Apr 03 20:54:26 <grym>	it's just a very domain specific tool
Apr 03 20:54:45 <roadie>	I use it for crysis modding
Apr 03 20:55:20 <roadie>	or, I will when I get to that
Apr 03 20:55:27 <aidalgol>	My main issue with JetBrains is how little keyboard accessibility there is.  It forces you to keep moving over to the mouse for common tasks.
Apr 03 20:55:32 <aidalgol>	roadie: haha!
Apr 03 20:55:41 <dale>	aidalgol: That is also my #1 beef with IDEA.
Apr 03 20:55:53 <aidalgol>	I got tired of Crysis at around the vehicle sections in chapter 2.
Apr 03 20:56:09 <dale>	aidalgol: To be honest, though, the rest of the product is pretty good.  If you enable the Emacs key bindings, then fix them on macOS, then maybe install some add-ons to do even more keyboard stuff you get... just pretty close.
Apr 03 20:56:35 <dale>	I think I actually have an SO question about IDEA keyboard navigability that is my most-up-voted question.
Apr 03 20:56:36 <aidalgol>	dale: Anyway, I'm done talking to heathens. :P
Apr 03 20:57:18 <aidalgol>	But it (Crysis) was already feeling tired before then.  Even on the highest difficulty, the infiltration mission in the harbour was mostly shooting dumb AI in the face as they lined up for execution.
Apr 03 20:57:34 <dale>	Yes, here we go, four years ago: "Allow page up/down in Python console [in PyCharm]", still open.  https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-18640
Apr 03 20:57:44 <aidalgol>	wth is youtrack?
Apr 03 20:57:52 <white_magic>	aidalgol: I'll grant you that the UI is kinda meh. But still.. even so.. consider this little thing: if you press 'Ctrl-Q', it takes you to this 'quick search', where you can search through various options in the IDE. Sounds like a small thing but it is not a small thing at all. This allows for better options/features discoverability than almost any IDE out there.
Apr 03 20:58:06 <dale>	aidalgol: YouTube videos of random people on the street reading bug reports.
Apr 03 20:58:15 <dale>	aidalgol: Just kidding, it's JetBrains's answer to Jira.
Apr 03 20:58:44 <roadie>	aidalgol: interesting - which FPS AI is the best you have played against?
Apr 03 20:59:12 <white_magic>	dale: PyCharm is actually quite buggy.. It's crazy how many little bugs there are. A few days ago, I found out that .. get this.. debugging broke - no idea why. It just never stops at breakpoints. I dug in a little bit. Spent like 20 minutes trying to fix it. Found various complaints and bugs on forums. After this I ditched PyCharm.
Apr 03 20:59:36 <white_magic>	I have had other annoyances with it too. Like, for example, its very lazy support of jupyter notebooks. A truly lackluster effort on their part.
Apr 03 21:00:05 <white_magic>	I think PyCharm is not a major focus of JetBrains
Apr 03 21:00:10 <dale>	As an Emacs user, what kills me the most about JetBrains IDEs is that I guess you have to restart them to install/remove/update extensions?
Apr 03 21:00:35 <white_magic>	dale: i don't think that's true anymore. Sometimes they prompt you to restart.. i think when installing a some 'beta' theme. But not usually
Apr 03 21:01:13 <white_magic>	roadie: I can chime in on the best FPS AI. Crysis & Far Cry definitely have some of the best. But also: S.T.A.L.K.E.R., F.E.A.R., and Half-Life 1 & 2
Apr 03 21:01:21 <white_magic>	all of those have realllly good AI
Apr 03 21:01:38 <white_magic>	F.E.A.R. probably has the best imho
Apr 03 21:03:55 <roadie>	white_magic: I have heard a few times that the F.E.A.R AI is great.
Apr 03 21:06:38 <white_magic>	roadie: I can attest to that. I also watched this YT vid that said that they didn't even do the most fancy of coding for its AI but rather worked at each level to provide waypointing/behaviors to the AI
Apr 03 21:07:18 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Emacs has had apropos for ages.
Apr 03 21:07:45 <white_magic>	roadie: the AI in FEAR will surprise you. The scariest thing is when you expect them to be hiding from you because you threw some nade or did suppressive fire. Then you find out .. they flanked you!
Apr 03 21:07:50 <aidalgol>	roadie: I hardly play FPS, so you're asking the wrong person.  Also, level design is almost as important as AI.
Apr 03 21:08:07 <aidalgol>	white_magic: I feel like the one person in the world who was unimpressed with the FEAR AI.
Apr 03 21:08:14 <aidalgol>	It was so obviously scripted.
Apr 03 21:08:17 <white_magic>	aidalgol: Yes, Emacs has things like that, but many mainstream IDEs don't. You just end up clicking and googling a lot to find some settings
Apr 03 21:08:19 <white_magic>	*setting
Apr 03 21:08:20 <aidalgol>	That's what made it great, but it wasn't surprising.
Apr 03 21:08:39 <white_magic>	aidalgol: maybe if you replay it, you figure out how it's scripted but I think I played it like once only
Apr 03 21:09:07 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Same.
Apr 03 21:09:10 <aidalgol>	I was bored.
Apr 03 21:09:28 <white_magic>	aidalgol: well one thing I did was I basically didn't use slo-mo at all
Apr 03 21:09:30 <aidalgol>	Maybe because I approach games looking for patterns.
Apr 03 21:09:32 <roadie>	they use waypoint decision making and maybe flanking / groupID like the crysis AI - the scripting is just that they all want to tell the story the player is supposed to see
Apr 03 21:09:37 <white_magic>	so it was more real-time for me and way way way more intense than perhaps intended
Apr 03 21:10:11 <aidalgol>	I mean, yes, it was more impressive than most FPS because the squads acted as a squad, but they were still pretty dumb.
Apr 03 21:10:36 <roadie>	you don't play FPS ... :)
Apr 03 21:10:37 <technomancy>	speaking of first person shooters, this is pretty impressive https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/108725-doom-4-vanilla-v259-new-version/?page=25
Apr 03 21:11:09 <aidalgol>	IIRC, Half-Life 2, which I found it to drag in places, had decent AI that didn't *always* just run at you to get mowed down.
Apr 03 21:11:21 <aidalgol>	Again, that was probably good level design as much as AI.
Apr 03 21:11:25 <white_magic>	aidalgol: what do you think of the Far Cry AI?
Apr 03 21:12:00 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Never played any.
Apr 03 21:12:04 <roadie>	we need a grid in the level so the AI can pretend it knows where it is - the rest is easy
Apr 03 21:12:17 <white_magic>	aidalgol: iirc far cry 1 had really good AI
Apr 03 21:12:23 <aidalgol>	roadie: I *did* say.
Apr 03 21:12:30 <roadie>	you did
Apr 03 21:12:32 <roadie>	:)
Apr 03 21:12:37 <aidalgol>	Not even for historical interest to see the origins of Ubisoft Sandbox Syndrome.
Apr 03 21:12:54 <aidalgol>	roadie: I prefer stealth games or vaguely tactical shooters.
Apr 03 21:13:10 <aidalgol>	I liked the gunplay in Shadow of Chernobyl.  Just found the story dull.
Apr 03 21:13:11 <roadie>	FarCry 1 is legendary :) and stealth is fun in that game
Apr 03 21:13:43 <aidalgol>	I wanted to like Thief, but the AI was too stupid to be fun.
Apr 03 21:13:46 <white_magic>	roadie: also, fun fact: FC1 was intended as a graphics demo for nvidia geforce3 or something. Then they decided they could also make a game out of it
Apr 03 21:14:04 <white_magic>	aidalgol: true, the story was meh but the environment was soooo immersive
Apr 03 21:14:06 <roadie>	I only played FarCry Crysis HalfLife and Doom3 and made levels for halflife and crysis
Apr 03 21:14:33 <aidalgol>	I think I enjoyed Opposing Force more than Half-Life itself.
Apr 03 21:14:42 <white_magic>	OpFor was incredible, for sure
Apr 03 21:14:45 <aidalgol>	More interesting weapons and better levels.
Apr 03 21:14:52 <white_magic>	but so was HL1.. they're very different
Apr 03 21:14:54 <aidalgol>	HL draaaaags a lot.
Apr 03 21:14:57 <roadie>	white_magic: that is correct - they went to las vegas with their last bucks and pressured nvidia to play their demo when GDC was near to closing time - the rest is history
Apr 03 21:14:59 <aidalgol>	Same with HL2.
Apr 03 21:15:08 <white_magic>	aidalgol: the xen worlds were lame AF in HL1
Apr 03 21:15:18 <aidalgol>	I do want to play Black Mesa, though.
Apr 03 21:15:31 <roadie>	Black Mesa has a nice website
Apr 03 21:15:33 <white_magic>	yea they just finished the xen worlds in BM
Apr 03 21:15:38 <aidalgol>	I think I enjoy shooters like Half-Life more than chaotic DOOM-like FPS.
Apr 03 21:15:48 <white_magic>	the last time i played BM was in like 2012.. so it took them 8 years to finish the xen worlds
Apr 03 21:16:01 <lxbarbosa>	Dr Fauci just said that "we aint even on halftime", while politicians are saying by the end of April we'll be ready to return to work. 
Apr 03 21:16:10 <roadie>	probably a few germans on the team
Apr 03 21:16:11 <white_magic>	aidalgol: me too.. the arcadey shooters are a bit much for me.. but i used to be into them once upon a time
Apr 03 21:16:29 <aidalgol>	roadie: What makes you say that?
Apr 03 21:16:34 <white_magic>	lxbarbosa: please, spare us.. this is our refuge from reality!
Apr 03 21:17:17 <roadie>	aidalgol: black mesa team
Apr 03 21:17:18 <roadie>	perfectionists
Apr 03 21:17:18 <white_magic>	speaking of Xen
Apr 03 21:17:23 <white_magic>	soo anyone played HL Alyx?
Apr 03 21:17:27 <roadie>	nope
Apr 03 21:17:33 <white_magic>	me neither.. 
Apr 03 21:17:36 <ldlework>	Only a few minutes so far
Apr 03 21:17:38 <white_magic>	wonder if it's playable without VR gear
Apr 03 21:17:54 <roadie>	I watched it and it is painful to see that god tier level design wasted on that story and dialog 
Apr 03 21:18:05 <aidalgol>	white_magic: nope
Apr 03 21:18:30 <white_magic>	i wanna wait till more VR games come out before i buy a new GPU cuz I'm pretty sure my gtx 1060 won't cut it
Apr 03 21:18:33 <aidalgol>	(to the second question)
Apr 03 21:18:43 <aidalgol>	I *think* my 1070 may cut it?
Apr 03 21:18:51 <aidalgol>	But I really don't want to gear up to play games.
Apr 03 21:19:00 <aidalgol>	So I don't think I'll ever get into VR gaming.
Apr 03 21:19:13 <roadie>	me neither - I am too old for that shit
Apr 03 21:19:14 <white_magic>	aidalgol: well they kinda make games to sell hardware half the time :D
Apr 03 21:19:23 <aidalgol>	Most of my favourites are third-person.
Apr 03 21:19:38 <roadie>	tombraider was my first 
Apr 03 21:19:38 <aidalgol>	white_magic: This is probably a large part of why most of the games I play these days are indies.
Apr 03 21:19:48 <white_magic>	aidalgol: i have seen NVidia RTX 2080 mentioned a lot so it seems like that GPU is the one to have for good perf vs quality
Apr 03 21:20:19 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Or you're just seeing posts from gamers who always want the top-tier shit.
Apr 03 21:20:20 <white_magic>	i wanna get into VR gaming because it could be an excuse to exercise :D
Apr 03 21:20:26 <roadie>	I have a 10 year old radeon jetenginenoiselevel card - good enough
Apr 03 21:20:49 <aidalgol>	I have a gtx 1070.  I'm holding onto that for quite a while.
Apr 03 21:20:55 <white_magic>	yea i hate having to upgrade hw so it may be years before i played HL Alyx 
Apr 03 21:21:13 <aidalgol>	The last game that made me upgrade was The Witcher 3.
Apr 03 21:21:14 <white_magic>	the benefit of playing games years later is that all the bugs are ironed out and perf is optimal
Apr 03 21:21:37 <white_magic>	aidalgol: that's a good game to upgrade for. I've heard so many people say that that game is perhaps the best RPG they ever played
Apr 03 21:21:37 <aidalgol>	white_magic: And all the questions have been asked on forums for you.
Apr 03 21:21:45 <white_magic>	that too
Apr 03 21:21:47 <roadie>	I have been playing crysis 1 since 2009
Apr 03 21:21:55 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Ehh, it's more a story-driven ARPG.
Apr 03 21:22:02 <roadie>	I got all the bugs ironed out
Apr 03 21:22:17 <aidalgol>	BTW, if any of you like story-driven games, I highly recommend Iconoclasts.
Apr 03 21:22:33 <roadie>	story and game ... in one sentence?
Apr 03 21:22:42 <white_magic>	as for me, i'm waiting for the next Bioshocks and Mass Effects.. super immersive games with incredible stories. Sadly, such games are so rare.
Apr 03 21:22:48 <aidalgol>	I think it marries storytelling and gameplay well, especially for a platformer.
Apr 03 21:22:55 <aidalgol>	Oh god, I hated Bioshock.
Apr 03 21:23:02 <white_magic>	why?
Apr 03 21:23:03 <fsbot>	why not?
Apr 03 21:23:32 <aidalgol>	The storytelling was lame, and the gameplay was bad.
Apr 03 21:23:49 <roadie>	oh, right - I meant plot not story
Apr 03 21:23:53 <white_magic>	gameplay was .. ok.. not bad.. but the env was so immersive..
Apr 03 21:23:57 <white_magic>	story was not bad
Apr 03 21:24:07 <aidalgol>	Most of the exposition was in audio logs.  I hate audio logs.
Apr 03 21:24:12 <ldlework>	aidalgol: I'm with you on it being overrated.
Apr 03 21:24:16 <white_magic>	oh yea i started skipping most of the audio logs
Apr 03 21:24:31 <spudpnds>	My gaming box is still on Windows 7. I haven't booted it in 6 months, because ... windows 7, and I don't want to deal with Windows 10.
Apr 03 21:24:31 <aidalgol>	Why have these characters left tape recorders lying around, in just the right order, too?
Apr 03 21:24:34 <roadie>	I like audio logs in moderate amounts
Apr 03 21:24:41 <aidalgol>	spudpnds: Switch to Wine! :P
Apr 03 21:24:41 <roadie>	anything too much - no good
Apr 03 21:24:43 <white_magic>	i mean to me, just the sound design in Bioshock puts it in a category of its own

Apr 03 23:41:22 <johnjay>	ok i improved it slightly
Apr 03 23:41:35 <johnjay>	this does what I mentioned. moves line up or down, with prefix arg moves it that many lines
Apr 03 23:41:37 <johnjay>	https://dpaste.org/sJyM
Apr 03 23:44:30 <miskatonic>	rpav = remotely piloted aerial vehicles
Apr 03 23:45:22 <rpav>	i've definitely been called worse
Apr 03 23:45:35 <rpav>	i feel like that's from an old nick/acronym expander though
Apr 03 23:48:10 <miskatonic>	There seems to be a language named J which is similar to API but no weird characters
Apr 03 23:48:35 <refusenick>	miskatonic: Believe me, the weird characters help.
Apr 03 23:49:09 <fengshaun>	how do I set the PATH env var that tramp should use with a remote host?
Apr 03 23:49:34 <fengshaun>	setting tramp-remote-path and tramp-remote-process-environment's ENV doesn't do the trick
Apr 03 23:49:43 <fengshaun>	I still get command not found
Apr 03 23:49:46 <refusenick>	J's fast, but APL can be faster: https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns
Apr 03 23:51:05 <refusenick>	I really like J's functional (real functional like Backus meant, not fake functional like lambdas) aspects because it's more like math, but pointfree really is hard to read. Adding back symbols to J helps, though.
Apr 03 23:51:52 <rpav>	"fake functional like lambdas"? ;)
Apr 03 23:52:43 <rpav>	"function-level programming", different thing
Apr 03 23:53:32 <refusenick>	rpav: The whole point of "functional programming" is to impart algebraic clarity on programs. Lambdas + recursion don't necessarily do that.
Apr 03 23:53:56 <refusenick>	Until proven otherwise, I'm calling it fake-functional because it misses the point.
Apr 03 23:54:13 <rpav>	i've always understood functional programming to be directly derived from the lambda calculus, Church's work, etc
Apr 03 23:54:49 <refusenick>	Functional programming's motivation is to make programming no different from composing and applying functions in math.
Apr 03 23:55:43 <rpav>	kinda, i mean ... the lambda calculus *is* math, FP deriving from that and being mathematical definitely makes sense, i mean, definitionally
Apr 03 23:55:44 <refusenick>	Removing the shroud of high-falutin terminology like "System F-omega", where's the clarity?
Apr 03 23:55:50 <rpav>	i have never really been a fan of FP personally
Apr 03 23:55:58 <refusenick>	*which kind*
Apr 03 23:56:21 <rpav>	*functional programming*, not Backus's "function-level programming" which .. i'm not sure what it is yet, still reading
Apr 03 23:56:56 <rpav>	i've always found FP seems to have a lot of really clever solutions to problems that only exist because of FP
Apr 03 23:56:57 <refusenick>	http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~beck/csc8310/BackusFP.pdf
Apr 03 23:57:15 <rpav>	cool, the wikipedia page is definitely not getting to the heart of the matter
Apr 03 23:57:49 <refusenick>	rpav: Lambda calculus isn't used in math. It's a logician's construction. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't resemble anything from algebra or analysis.

Apr 04 12:07:25 <jfb4>	question: in compilation-mode or grep-mode, cycling through errors or matches opens a number of buffers, is there a way to automatically close them as you keep looking for results?
Apr 04 12:27:11 <roadie>	is there any way to run a file through uniq without changing the order of the lines? I have a 174MB that reduces to 37MB when sorted and 'uniqed' but then a lot of sense is lost ...
Apr 04 12:53:47 <roadie>	nvm
Apr 04 13:09:32 <andinus>	roadie: how did you solve it?
Apr 04 13:14:39 <grift>	there seems to be an inaccuracy in https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rmail-Inbox.html
Apr 04 13:15:08 <grift>	it does not seems to use ".newmail-NAME" but instead if uses "tmpXXXXXX"
Apr 04 13:15:44 <grift>	i guess that might have changed over time but that docs might not have been adjusted to reflect the new
Apr 04 13:16:24 <grift>	there shouldnt be a need for that random name though as its in ~
Apr 04 13:16:43 <grift>	and having a predictable name has its advantages
Apr 04 13:24:57 <roadie>	andinus: I did not - is it doable? 
Apr 04 13:28:49 <roadie>	grift: how do you know?
Apr 04 13:30:03 <grift>	auditing
Apr 04 13:30:32 <andinus>	roadie: if the order is a pattern then you can pipe it to sort
Apr 04 13:30:37 <grift>	but i might have a solution to the issue i was trying to solve (not sure yet)
Apr 04 13:30:48 <grift>	you can define rmail-file-name
Apr 04 13:31:18 <grift>	if i set that to something in a predicably named dir then i can rely on it
Apr 04 13:32:10 <grift>	ie ~/RMAIL/RMAIL
Apr 04 13:32:30 <grift>	but something says that it creates a backup in "~/RMAIL~"
Apr 04 13:32:42 <grift>	and if thats true than that would defeat the purpose
Apr 04 13:37:30 <grift>	yes rmail-file-name solves my issue, it doesnt doesnt create a backup ~/RMAIL~
Apr 04 13:39:26 <roadie>	that is set to ~/RMAIL here, yup
Apr 04 13:39:33 <parsnip>	roadie: M-x delete-duplicate-lines works here

Apr 04 14:04:45 <dustfinger>	Is there a way to specify the TERM used by serial-term for a specific session? I am connecting to a device using vt100, but vt100 is not a valid termcap for the device I am connecting to.
Apr 04 14:05:18 <codingquark>	Investing why my laptop disconnects from znc again and again
Apr 04 14:08:17 <isBEKaml>	dustfinger: I don't use term-mode or serial-term, but I suspect it's just an env var. so, use setenv?
Apr 04 14:08:55 <codingquark>	Looks like pathetic RF drivers are causing the connection to drop.
Apr 04 14:08:57 <codingquark>	Oh fuck it.
Apr 04 14:09:09 <dustfinger>	Yah, I can change it with setenv, but that would set it for the entire emacs session, what if I want one buffer to use TERM=linux and another to use TERM=dummy?
Apr 04 14:09:28 <dustfinger>	I will experiment. Maybe it will just work.
Apr 04 14:10:04 <expert975>	My terminal emulator changes themes with a key press. Some emacs face colors adapt to the new theme, such as background and foreground, but others, such as strings and function names, don't. Is there a way to set faces to follow the current terminal theme?
Apr 04 14:10:53 <dustfinger>	nm. the $TERM environmentn variable from emacs has nothing to do with the device defaulting to vt100.

Apr 04 22:11:12 <wrycode>	oh I found it, it's in his workflow.org file
Apr 04 22:38:07 <jfb4>	a question: in compilation-mode or grep-mode, cycling through errors or
Apr 04 22:38:08 <jfb4>	       matches opens a number of buffers, is there a way to automatically
Apr 04 22:38:08 <jfb4>	       close them as you keep looking for results?
Apr 04 22:45:06 <dale>	jfb4: I have never seen anything like that.  I'm kind of interested to know if you find something, though.
Apr 04 22:46:18 <dale>	For writing something super-general to do that, I guess you could hook into buffer-list-update-hook to notice what command has just created a buffer.  Then something like pre-command-hook/post-command-hook to notice if you're doing the same command over and over.
Apr 04 22:47:10 <dale>	Alternatively maybe you could do something like recording in each buffer what command caused the buffer to be created, then a timer that will kill the buffer after N seconds if no other command has caused the buffer to be activated.
Apr 04 22:47:32 <dale>	Less generally I assume you could just wrap next-error and do... something.
Apr 04 22:48:46 <shrysr>	wrycode: i've been finding helm-swoop to be helpful for writing longer programs with org documents.
Apr 04 22:54:59 <shrysr>	bremner: howddya mean combining multiple files? Curious to know if you have any tricks/tips for that in general. For example, tangle different sets of headings to different directories apparently can work if the directory is specified via elisp? Doesnt work as one would expect with the :dir header-argument.

Apr 04 23:44:13 <dale>	wrycode: Actually, maybe variable org-clock-heading is even better for your purposes.  Here's how I put the task name in the tooltip indicator for being clocked in on my mode line: https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/master/init.el#L2612
Apr 04 23:44:35 <wrycode>	sort of but I'm using a custom modeline with powerline so I'm not sure how to put that back in the mode line 
Apr 04 23:45:19 <wrycode>	oh shoot org-clock-heading is literally exactly what I want
Apr 04 23:45:25 <dale>	I don't know if org-clock-heading gets cleared after you clock out or not.  If so you could probably easily save it off into a file, if you really want to know the last clocked task.
Apr 04 23:45:48 <wrycode>	it shows the most recent task, and I can use org-clocking-p to display the clock status
Apr 04 23:45:50 <dale>	org-clock-out-hook could do that, for example.
Apr 04 23:50:02 <wrycode>	dale: I'll try it with a conditional in the mode-line-format which is easier to write. If it's too slow I'll use org-clock-out/in-hook. Thanks for pointing out org-clock-heading, I didn't see it at all

Apr 04 23:53:15 <bremner>	shrysr: basically I want to re-use functions in multiple org files, for export and tangle
Apr 04 23:54:01 <bremner>	shrysr: the only method I have so far is # Local Variables: \n# eval: (org-babel-lob-ingest "lecture21.org")\n# End:
Apr 05 00:00:14 <shrysr>	bremner: yea. i am not aware of anything other than lob and local variables to do this.. but then i discover new stuff every other day.
Apr 05 00:00:29 <shrysr>	bremner: i wonder if projectile based .dir-locals.el would help tho. Currently experimenting with that for python environments. Would still probably mean lob ingesting, but could be easier to handle as a single file catering to many? 
Apr 05 00:01:50 <bremner>	I'm not sure. I have multiple "projects" in one directory, so...
Apr 05 00:27:00 <shrysr>	wrycode: not sure about that. i have not used isearch much. helm-swoop appears to limit searches to source blocks or headers depending on where you start / filter...also has a buncha other nifty functions. I've also been using hippie-expand for variable names..

Apr 10 10:02:34 <aidalgol>	Man, I want to add to my `shackle-rules' for the first time in almost four years, and I've completely forgotten the interface.
Apr 10 10:02:49 <aidalgol>	Is this the inverse of code entropy?
Apr 10 10:03:26 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 10 10:03:35 <wasamasa>	has it been that long?
Apr 10 10:03:47 <aidalgol>	It has.  I checked with git blame
Apr 10 10:03:54 <aidalgol>	(on my config, not on shackle)
Apr 10 10:05:09 <wasamasa>	wow, I really did create it six years ago
Apr 10 10:05:31 <wasamasa>	IIRC you were the one who made me devise a EBNF grammar
Apr 10 10:06:39 <aidalgol>	Yeah, that's actually pretty good in combination with the English explanations above.
Apr 10 10:06:53 <wasamasa>	I wonder whether it was helpful for anyone else than you :D
Apr 10 10:06:59 <aidalgol>	I still plead Sgt Schultz.
Apr 10 10:09:23 <aidalgol>	OK, that joke might not translate well...
Apr 10 10:10:23 <wasamasa>	the three monkeys?
Apr 10 10:10:33 <aidalgol>	Hogan's Heroes.
Apr 10 10:11:24 <aidalgol>	Schultz was always trying to avoid responsibility by saying "I hear nothing. I see nothing!" when witnessing or overhearing the plotting of the prisoners he was supposed to be keeping watch on.
Apr 10 10:11:40 <wasamasa>	see/hear/speak no evil
Apr 10 10:12:02 <aidalgol>	This was more feigning ignorance.
Apr 10 10:15:14 <aidalgol>	Hmm, ("*inferior-lisp*" :ignore t) works as expected, but ("*inferior-lisp*" :other t) does not.  Instead, it behaves as ("*inferior-lisp*" :same t) should.
Apr 10 10:16:01 <wasamasa>	this :other/:same thing is super limited
Apr 10 10:19:02 <faceface>	hihi
Apr 10 10:19:09 <faceface>	Ctrl-x Ctrl-c isn't working 
Apr 10 10:19:19 <faceface>	The term seems broken somehow
Apr 10 10:19:32 <faceface>	I had to manually set TERM=xterm

Apr 10 10:20:49 <wasamasa>	kill-emacs skips the saving part
Apr 10 10:21:00 <faceface>	k, I'm saved
Apr 10 10:21:29 <aidalgol>	Is there something else I could use to achieve the same effect, just for `run-lisp'?
Apr 10 10:21:53 <wasamasa>	it uses `pop-to-buffer-same-window'
Apr 10 10:22:17 <aidalgol>	IIRC, geiser opens the REPL buffer in a separate window, whereas run-lisp opens its buffer in the current window.
Apr 10 10:22:20 <aidalgol>	Which is super annoying.
Apr 10 10:24:34 <wasamasa>	wait, what if you try :popup
Apr 10 10:24:45 <wasamasa>	does that do it?
Apr 10 10:25:04 <aidalgol>	Same behaviour.
Apr 10 10:26:47 <wasamasa>	weird, with :popup t I get the lisp buffer in a new window
Apr 10 10:26:53 <wasamasa>	or isn't that what you wanted?
Apr 10 10:27:07 <faceface>	thanks again
Apr 10 10:28:02 <aidalgol>	That's what I want, but not what I'm getting.
Apr 10 10:28:17 <aidalgol>	I don't need to disable then re-enable shackle-mode after setting shackle-rules, do I?
Apr 10 10:29:26 <wasamasa>	nah
Apr 10 10:29:39 <wasamasa>	try with a minimal config
Apr 10 10:33:55 <aidalgol>	OK, I just tried with emacs -q with only shackle loaded, and I get the exact same behaviour.
Apr 10 10:34:10 <aidalgol>	I'm running Emacs 26.1 from Debian.
Apr 10 10:34:13 <wasamasa>	I mean, a minimal set of rules
Apr 10 10:34:21 <aidalgol>	And just that one rule.
Apr 10 10:34:30 <wasamasa>	what is the rule?
Apr 10 10:34:31 <fsbot>	rule is For a horizontal bar/line on the page, do !l Some text \\ \rule{\textwidth}{1pt} \\ Some more text. The width can be given instead of \emph{1pt}.
Apr 10 10:34:38 <aidalgol>	("*inferior-lisp*" :popup t)
Apr 10 10:34:42 <aidalgol>	or ("*inferior-lisp*" :other t)
Apr 10 10:34:47 <wasamasa>	try inferior-lisp-mode
Apr 10 10:34:50 <aidalgol>	,shoot fsbot 
Apr 10 10:34:50 *	fsbot loads its neural lace and wires aidalgol up to the console as a shell.
Apr 10 10:35:11 <aidalgol>	AAAAHHH!!!!
Apr 10 10:35:16 <wasamasa>	yeah, I know
Apr 10 10:35:59 <aidalgol>	no. no joy.
Apr 10 10:36:27 <wasamasa>	I must be doing something wrong
Apr 10 10:38:13 <aidalgol>	Where in shackle.el should I start step-through debugging?
Apr 10 10:38:38 <wasamasa>	http://ix.io/2hqG
Apr 10 10:38:49 <wasamasa>	this is a minimal init file I cannot reproduce the issue with
Apr 10 10:39:05 <wasamasa>	it splits the current window into two
Apr 10 10:40:01 <wasamasa>	this is on emacs 26.3
Apr 10 10:40:17 <wasamasa>	try emacs -Q -l test.el
Apr 10 10:40:33 <wasamasa>	and don't forget adjusting the path to shackle :P
Apr 10 10:41:04 <aidalgol>	Is it OK if it's an elpa directory from my main emacs config?
Apr 10 10:41:09 <wasamasa>	sure
Apr 10 10:41:26 <wasamasa>	you could even try to avoid it by using package-initialize
Apr 10 10:41:35 <aidalgol>	oh yeah, I'm using shackle 1.0.3
Apr 10 10:41:58 <wasamasa>	wow, me too
Apr 10 10:58:39 <wasamasa>	so, how do your tests go?
Apr 10 10:59:07 <mixfix411>	asdffsff
Apr 10 10:59:40 <wasamasa>	not sure whether mixfix411 is a badly programmed bot or clueless person
Apr 10 11:00:09 <mixfix411>	casdasdasd
Apr 10 11:05:53 <wasamasa>	ok, a 9-year-old
Apr 10 11:29:39 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: OK, that worked.
Apr 10 11:29:44 <aidalgol>	(sorry, got waylaid)
Apr 10 11:29:52 <wasamasa>	you what?
Apr 10 11:30:00 <aidalgol>	dragged away
Apr 10 11:32:44 <wasamasa>	well, if the snippet works, then it must be something in your init file
Apr 10 11:33:07 <aidalgol>	Uh, how do I use the bisect method when ELPA packages are part of my init?
Apr 10 11:33:53 <bpalmer>	mv away half of them.
Apr 10 11:34:00 <aidalgol>	ugh...
Apr 10 11:36:54 <aidalgol>	wtf is canlock?
Apr 10 11:49:36 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: This gets weirder: if I run emacs -l test.el with test.el containing just (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/racket") (call-interactively 'run-lisp), with my full, normal config, it works as expected.
Apr 10 11:50:17 <aidalgol>	Eval-ing that file, With that exact same config, it behaves incorrectly.

Apr 10 12:09:38 <aidalgol>	That's a minimal reproduction of the bug.
Apr 10 12:23:45 <wasamasa>	but why are you using :other?
Apr 10 12:30:00 <wasamasa>	anyway, the issue is that window--try-to-split-window fails creating a new one
Apr 10 12:30:50 <aidalgol>	I get the same behaviour as with :popup.
Apr 10 12:34:08 <wasamasa>	this happens because it calls split-window-sensibly (hahaha)
Apr 10 12:34:14 <wasamasa>	which considers the window unsplittable
Apr 10 12:34:36 <wasamasa>	ffs
Apr 10 12:36:04 <wasamasa>	for that it calls window-splittable-p which honors a few customizables
Apr 10 12:36:57 <wasamasa>	neither vertical nor horizontal split are deemed OK
Apr 10 12:38:47 <giorgian>	Hi. What does "assignment to free variable `some-variable'" means, exactly?
Apr 10 12:39:41 <wasamasa>	it means the variable hasn't been declared
Apr 10 12:40:18 <wasamasa>	assigning to an undeclared variable isn't something you should do in package code
Apr 10 12:41:48 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: the easy workaround is setting both `split-height-threshold' and `split-width-threshold' to a low number, like 0
Apr 10 12:42:06 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: this is what I do, hence why I've never run into your behavior
Apr 10 12:42:25 <giorgian>	So, should I stop splitting my emacs configuration in packages, or should I be sure to assign the variable after loading the package that defines it?
Apr 10 12:42:47 <giorgian>	(or both?)
Apr 10 12:42:51 <wasamasa>	your emacs configuration is not package code
Apr 10 12:43:09 <wasamasa>	it's above code quality checking
Apr 10 12:43:43 <wasamasa>	using a byte-compiler on it is overkill
Apr 10 12:44:00 <wasamasa>	honor these warnings when writing your own packages, otherwise they're useless
Apr 10 12:44:05 <giorgian>	should I use (load "my-file.el") to split my configuration into several files?
Apr 10 12:44:18 <wasamasa>	depends on what you want to do
Apr 10 12:44:50 <wasamasa>	I'd use load-file
Apr 10 12:45:05 <giorgian>	ok, thank you.
Apr 10 12:45:39 <wasamasa>	require assumes you want to load something identified by its feature name, which is mostly useful when writing packages
Apr 10 12:45:52 <wasamasa>	load-file assumes you want to load something identified by its path
Apr 10 12:45:57 <wasamasa>	load is used by both
Apr 10 12:46:11 <giorgian>	perfect, thank you.
Apr 10 12:46:31 <wasamasa>	while you can organize your init file like a package, it doesn't make much sense to do that and has side effects such as reloading not working
Apr 10 12:46:54 <giorgian>	oh, I wasn't aware of that, thank you
Apr 10 12:48:50 <giorgian>	Another question: my biggest problem in splitting my init.el file, right now, is the huge custom-set-variables block. Should I just stop using customize-variable, customize-group etc. forever and just use setq, or is there a way to use those functions and have them write in different files?
Apr 10 12:49:11 <wasamasa>	custom.el doesn't support multiple blocks
Apr 10 12:49:31 <wasamasa>	that's why many people forego it for everything it's not needed for
Apr 10 12:49:46 <giorgian>	excellent, thank you
Apr 10 12:49:50 <jamzattack>	(setq custom-file "wherever") at the beginning of your init file if it gets in your way
Apr 10 12:51:52 <jamzattack>	It's sometimes a good idea to put groups of related functions etc. into their own package that can be loaded with use-package or something though
Apr 10 12:53:36 <jamzattack>	e.g. https://0x0.st/iSWb.el
Apr 10 12:55:36 <giorgian>	jamzattack: I see, thank you
Apr 10 12:55:36 <giorgian>	 
Apr 10 13:02:20 <giorgian>	So, How do I tell flycheck that "some-file.el" is not a package?
Apr 10 13:03:05 <wasamasa>	simply by not enabling it for that buffer
Apr 10 13:03:39 <wasamasa>	enable it for buffers where you want it, not globally
Apr 10 13:04:10 <wasamasa>	for that you can use a hook that checks `buffer-file-name' before enabling it
Apr 10 13:04:56 <giorgian>	OK, thank you -- maybe I could do the opposite, have a list of filenames for which not to enable it
Apr 10 13:05:07 <wasamasa>	it's elisp, go wild
Apr 10 13:05:26 <wasamasa>	you have conditional forms, you have regex matching, ...
Apr 10 13:05:38 <bremner>	pcase!
Apr 10 13:06:08 <giorgian>	wasamasa: you're right, of course
Apr 10 13:06:58 <wasamasa>	I have a directory where all the packages I hack on are and check for it in such a hook
Apr 10 13:07:49 <giorgian>	Yes, that's what I was thinking, thank you
Apr 10 13:13:54 <giorgian>	Is there a way to have flycheck display the name of the rule alongside the message?
Apr 10 13:15:41 <wasamasa>	flycheck just displays whatever the checker figured out
Apr 10 13:15:49 <wasamasa>	if the checker uses rules, sure
Apr 10 13:15:56 <wasamasa>	but the byte-compiler doesn't have such a thing
Apr 10 13:25:04 <giorgian>	I was hoping to keep emacs-lisp while disabling (locally) emacs-lisp-checkdoc...
Apr 10 13:34:14 <wasamasa>	that's something else though
Apr 10 13:36:27 <wasamasa>	the emacs-lisp checker is configured to run the emacs-lisp-checkdoc checker next
Apr 10 13:36:27 <giorgian>	wasamasa: yes, sorry - initially I thought they were part of the same checker, it took me some grepping to find out. Also, I found my answer: a .dir-locals.el file in my ~/.emacs.d/config directory
Apr 10 13:37:44 <giorgian>	as described here https://www.flycheck.org/en/27/_downloads/flycheck.html

Apr 10 13:39:36 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: I like that emacs gives you the option to customize these thresholds, but it's still surprising when you're using a 23" screen, yet can't split a window in a frame

Apr 10 15:37:19 <quiliro>	haha
Apr 10 15:38:03 <bremner>	delay due to lab overwork
Apr 10 15:38:18 <mplsCorwin>	he lives!
Apr 10 15:38:50 <bremner>	who you calling alive?
Apr 10 15:38:55 <mplsCorwin>	Ack.  Got you confused with bandali again bremner.
Apr 10 15:39:00 <bremner>	ook
Apr 10 15:39:03 <mplsCorwin>	 lol
Apr 10 15:39:32 <cvandusen>	The resemblance is uncanny 
Apr 10 15:39:33 <bremner>	I've met bandali, so I'm relatively sure he's not me. Unlike bpalmer and rudybot
Apr 10 15:39:56 <quiliro>	Maybe he is you in another dimension!
Apr 10 15:40:05 <quiliro>	or in another reality
Apr 10 15:40:25 <cvandusen>	rudybot: reality, what a concept
Apr 10 15:40:36 <rudybot>	cvandusen: m4 is an interesting concept but a terrifying reality.
Apr 10 15:41:08 <cvandusen>	much like the baconator
Apr 10 15:41:32 <Plazma>	,baconator
Apr 10 15:41:35 <fsbot>	Not enough people play SKEE-BALL..  They're always thinking about COCAINE or and ALIEN BEINGS!!
Apr 10 15:41:44 <Plazma>	i like everything i just read within the past 10 seconds
Apr 10 15:41:58 <Plazma>	rudybot: baconator
Apr 10 15:41:59 <rudybot>	Plazma: much like the baconator
Apr 10 15:42:15 <highmemorydaemon>	What package does Spacemacs use to get that menu pop up when you hit spacebar?
Apr 10 15:42:28 <Plazma>	highmemorydaemon: helm maybe?
Apr 10 15:42:35 <Plazma>	or the other one
Apr 10 15:42:40 <cvandusen>	C-h k will tell the tale 
Apr 10 15:43:19 <highmemorydaemon>	cvandusen: I don't think I can because it is a map. Like it expects you to hit another key after spacebar.
Apr 10 15:43:39 <highmemorydaemon>	cantstanya: Ex. after hitting the spacebar you can hit ! to run a shell cmd
Apr 10 15:43:45 <cvandusen>	Then press C-h 
Apr 10 15:44:09 <bremner>	there's hydra, but I suspect spacemacs NIHs it.
Apr 10 15:44:18 <bremner>	,spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:19 <fsbot>	I think spacemacs is [0/6] A Emacs distribution centered around evil-mode, with the tag line "the best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and Vim"
Apr 10 15:44:19 <fsbot>	[1] at https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:20 <fsbot>	[2] support is available at https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:20 <fsbot>	[3] has its own subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/ ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 15:44:24 <quiliro>	Plazma: you like: '("<Plazma>" "baconator," "<fsbot>" "Not" "enough" "people" "play" "SKEE-BALL.." "They're" "always" "thinking" "about"
Apr 10 15:44:25 <quiliro>		"COCAINE" "or" "and" "ALIEN" "BEINGS!!")
Apr 10 15:44:30 <cvandusen>	Though, the fact that spacemacs is overriding the spacebar is another selling point against it.
Apr 10 15:46:23 <highmemorydaemon>	cvandusen: I think it only does that if you select evil mode during setup. It's pretty intuitive in that case because what else would you use the spacebar for in normal mode in Vim editing.
Apr 10 15:46:49 <Plazma>	i use C-Space for my tmux setup, actually.. C-a and C-b would interfere with emacs bindings
Apr 10 15:46:58 <Plazma>	i got tied of hitting C-a C-a twice
Apr 10 15:49:39 <grym>	i settled on C-o 
Apr 10 15:49:57 <grym>	C-space opens Spotlight on some of my machines 
Apr 10 15:51:26 <Plazma>	grym: for tmux? you do a lot of emacs in the terminal?
Apr 10 15:51:49 <grym>	Plazma: C-o for tmux; i don't do a whole lot of emacs in terminal but do love readline bindings 
Apr 10 15:52:02 <Plazma>	readline bindings? 
Apr 10 15:54:40 <highmemorydaemon>	Ok, so I think it's using which-key
Apr 10 15:56:31 <grym>	Plazma: most shells use GNU readline at the prompt 
Apr 10 15:56:34 <grym>	which act like emacs 
Apr 10 15:56:37 <grym>	normally 
Apr 10 15:56:46 <Plazma>	ohhh
Apr 10 15:56:56 <grym>	ever wondered why C-a, C-k "work at the bash prompt"? readline is why 
Apr 10 15:57:06 <Plazma>	ah yes, i did
Apr 10 15:57:16 <Plazma>	it's like they planned it out or something
Apr 10 15:57:22 <grym>	funny thing 
Apr 10 15:57:42 <grym>	speaking of which: C-u is "kill backwards to start of line" in bash/readline -- what's this spelled like in emacs? 
Apr 10 15:59:17 <rpav>	you'd think there's be backward-kill-line, but no .. i write my own backward-delete-line (which i would have anyway, because adding to the kill ring i find annoying)
Apr 10 16:01:41 <ngz>	grym: It is `kill-line' with a 0 argument.
Apr 10 16:03:32 <rpav>	ah .. doesn't respect the visual line though
Apr 10 16:03:56 <grym>	rpav: what do you mean by visual line 
Apr 10 16:04:01 <wgreenhouse>	,,df kill-visual-line
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	kill-visual-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	‘simple.el’.
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	(kill-visual-line &optional ARG)
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	Kill the rest of the visual line. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 16:04:06 <wgreenhouse>	^
Apr 10 16:04:06 <ngz>	rpav: Then use `kill-visual-line' with a 0 argument.
Apr 10 16:04:13 <wgreenhouse>	grym: soft wrapping
Apr 10 16:04:48 <Plazma>	,helm
Apr 10 16:04:49 <fsbot>	helm is [0] incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking for stuff in Emacs

Apr 10 16:04:49 <fsbot>	[2] unofficial tutorial: https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html
Apr 10 16:04:54 <grym>	wgreenhouse: ahha.  
Apr 10 16:04:56 <grym>	ok cool 
Apr 10 16:05:07 <wgreenhouse>	as in visual-line-mode
Apr 10 16:05:15 <grym>	and you can bind "a function with some prefix arguments" to a normal binding right 
Apr 10 16:05:30 <wgreenhouse>	(Not stellar naming even by Emacs standards)
Apr 10 16:05:36 <wgreenhouse>	grym: yep
Apr 10 16:05:54 <grym>	cool cool
Apr 10 16:06:00 <rpav>	visual-line is soft wrapping, yeah, and with adaptive-wrap-prefix is magical
Apr 10 16:06:39 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: if that works these days with heavy indent-using things like org-mode, I'm sokd
Apr 10 16:06:43 <wgreenhouse>	*sold
Apr 10 16:06:56 <rpav>	dunno, i don't even use org mode, i don't see the need
Apr 10 16:07:01 <wgreenhouse>	Tired of using emacs like a typewriter for natural language 
Apr 10 16:07:21 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: k, I'll ,,tias
Apr 10 16:07:22 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 10 16:07:48 <rpav>	(i'd be surprised if it didn't, unless org-mode already handles auto-indent/wrap on its own)
Apr 10 16:08:19 <ngz>	wgreenhouse: what is heavy indent-using in Org? I only see plain lists. Any other indentation is optional.
Apr 10 16:09:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ngz: Perhaps they enable the optional indent mode.
Apr 10 16:10:36 <wgreenhouse>	ngz: paragraphs. I use org to author docs with lots of subheadings
Apr 10 16:10:40 <Twist>	org has an indent startup option
Apr 10 16:10:52 <ngz>	Paragraphs do not need to be indented, do they?
Apr 10 16:10:57 <wgreenhouse>	Traditionally this looked terrible in visual-line-mode
Apr 10 16:11:02 <wgreenhouse>	No but I want them to be
Apr 10 16:11:13 <Twist>	oddly, this seems to have become the default somwehere along the line.. I just noticed I'm not specfying indent on my fedora box, and it's enabled
Apr 10 16:11:45 <wgreenhouse>	it may also depend on whether you use electric indent globally 
Apr 10 16:11:52 <wgreenhouse>	(I do_
Apr 10 16:11:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I heavily use sub-headings, so it annoys me far too much to use it.
Apr 10 16:12:00 <rpav>	what looks terrible in vlm+org mode? it doesn't indent the paragraph body?
Apr 10 16:12:02 <ngz>	I think a sane change is to set `org-adapt-indentation' to nil.
Apr 10 16:12:14 <Twist>	wgreenhouse: I don't suppose you've found a usable wrapping solution for org tables?
Apr 10 16:12:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	There's no way I can imagine of sanely wrapping tables.
Apr 10 16:12:46 <rpav>	wrapping tables doesn't make any sense
Apr 10 16:12:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	^
Apr 10 16:13:09 <Twist>	You'd need word wrap in individual cells.
Apr 10 16:13:12 <rpav>	i mean unless you print them, roll them up, and put them in a package, or something ;)
Apr 10 16:13:30 <rpav>	i think at that point org-mode is probably not the tool for the job
Apr 10 16:13:35 <Twist>	Excel certainly manages.
Apr 10 16:13:44 <mplsCorwin>	A (better) solution for table cells containing multi-line and paragraph content would be cool.
Apr 10 16:14:07 <ngz>	There's `org-table-wrap-region'.
Apr 10 16:14:14 *	Twist googles
Apr 10 16:15:03 <ngz>	It is a strange beast, tho.
Apr 10 16:15:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Excel doesn't afaik. It simply scrolls out of sccreen.
Apr 10 16:15:16 <Twist>	That appers to insert a manual linebreak into a cell, if I'm reading correctly
Apr 10 16:15:33 <Twist>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: you can enable wrapping within cells.
Apr 10 16:15:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Unless you mean per-cell wrapping.
Apr 10 16:15:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah
Apr 10 16:16:03 <Twist>	ANd you can select columns or the entire sheet to quickly and broadly apply the attribute
Apr 10 16:16:31 <mplsCorwin>	Eipes. "If you formatted it to more lines than it was before, fields further down in the table get overwritten"
Apr 10 16:17:02 <Twist>	I admit my use case is wierd. I'm using org babel with sql server.
Apr 10 16:17:15 <Twist>	The result sets return as tables, and of course are sometimes very wide
Apr 10 16:17:18 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: correct, paragraph body not indented 
Apr 10 16:17:43 <Twist>	So I wind up having to toggle wrap on and off depending on whether I'm working in prose or with the result set.
Apr 10 16:17:45 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: yeah the adaptive wrap prefix should definitely solve that
Apr 10 16:19:20 <mplsCorwin>	Twist: what about iteratively breaking down your big table into more human facing structures e.g. with calc/formulas?  Maybe the "raw" data table can be hidden or deemphasized in the output document.
Apr 10 16:20:25 <Twist>	Manual display formatting has rapidly diminshing returns. 
Apr 10 16:20:54 <mplsCorwin>	Right, but writing code to turn big ones into little ones is a time honored method of creating useful human facing reportage.
Apr 10 16:22:04 <mplsCorwin>	In any case, sorry if that's the wrong direction.  Luck.
Apr 10 16:22:07 <Twist>	I'm doing sysadmin work, not creating reports for downstream consumption. 
Apr 10 16:22:46 <Twist>	So the only real problem is my own allergic reaction to hscroll.
Apr 10 16:24:36 <rpav>	let's make everything diagonal, to maximize horizontal space
Apr 10 16:25:00 <ngz>	Note that you can narrow an Org column
Apr 10 16:25:09 <mplsCorwin>	Won't work.  Too many of us are crooked.
Apr 10 16:25:32 <Twist>	ngz: doesn't that truncate rather than wrap?
Apr 10 16:26:06 <ngz>	Twist: That truncates, yes. It is useful to hide boring stuff and keep row short enough.
Apr 10 16:26:23 <mplsCorwin>	I wonder if items + column view mode would be better than tables...
Apr 10 16:26:46 <Twist>	My lowbrow solution is just to html export and pop it open in a browser, where tables behave like this by default.
Apr 10 16:27:45 <rpav>	yeah i just typically type markdown-ish files with lots of indentation myself .. if i ever really, really care about how it looks formatted, i'll format it
Apr 10 16:28:11 <rpav>	and not even like some markdown-mode, just good ol' text-mode
Apr 10 16:28:19 <Twist>	But visual-line-mode looks like garbage with wide tables. You essentially have to ignore the region.
Apr 10 16:28:37 <Twist>	It'd also be nice if tables just didn't wrap
Apr 10 16:28:47 <rpav>	yeah i dunno what to do if you need a lot of tables... it actually annoys me a bit there's not a good format for importing data that's also relatively simple
Apr 10 16:29:26 <quiliro>	Talking about tables, what do you recommend for handling the following situation for me. I need to make a list of products I buy ...those products have several producers....those producers have contact information.
Apr 10 16:29:44 <rpav>	it's too bad visual-line-mode can't stop wrapping around certain markers, or something
Apr 10 16:30:08 <Twist>	Some sort of soft wrap that isn't the actual document width
Apr 10 16:30:22 <rpav>	quiliro: how many?
Apr 10 16:30:36 <quiliro>	Right now i have a list of the products with the names of the producers and contact details repeating for producers of multiple products
Apr 10 16:30:57 <rpav>	sounds like a job for a database with any realistic number of records
Apr 10 16:31:01 <quiliro>	and also I would have to repeat a product if there are several producers of the same product
Apr 10 16:31:04 <Twist>	quiliro: Did this just turn into a relational database normalization question?
Apr 10 16:31:13 <quiliro>	2000 products
Apr 10 16:31:20 <rpav>	database :p
Apr 10 16:31:38 <quiliro>	nosql?
Apr 10 16:31:40 <fsbot>	[->] mongodb is [0] an open source document-oriented nosql database ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 16:31:58 <rpav>	i wouldn't use nosql for anything that wasn't specifically freeform-document-oriented.. and maybe even then
Apr 10 16:32:03 <Twist>	or sqlite 
Apr 10 16:32:35 <Twist>	Sure, there are better DBs.. but sqlite has pretty low startup cost.
Apr 10 16:32:39 <rpav>	then it's a matter of "how important is your data and who's using it," which ranges from "sqlite" (not very, me) to "postgres" (very, a lot of people)
Apr 10 16:33:04 <rpav>	actually i'm not sure there's much in between either
Apr 10 16:33:24 <Twist>	access. :D
Apr 10 16:33:27 <quiliro>	it is just me
Apr 10 16:33:41 <quiliro>	I heard about BBDB
Apr 10 16:33:52 <Twist>	Actually, doesn't libreoffce have a db module?
Apr 10 16:33:59 <rpav>	ah, i didn't consider negative space .. "my data needs destroyed, and not even i am using it"
Apr 10 16:34:07 <Twist>	haha
Apr 10 16:34:23 <quiliro>	negative space?
Apr 10 16:34:32 <rpav>	sqlite is a really solid option unless you're trying for distributing or big backups
Apr 10 16:34:56 <quiliro>	I woooould not use LO...rather something that works with Emacs
Apr 10 16:34:59 <rpav>	it's not unreliable, it's just i think the options for backup and restore might be slightly more limited
Apr 10 16:35:12 <Twist>	quiliro: are you already using org mode?
Apr 10 16:35:17 <quiliro>	yes
Apr 10 16:35:26 <Twist>	quiliro: how about org babel?
Apr 10 16:35:38 <mplsCorwin>	My $.02. I'd probably just go with seperate org docs for each product, or maybe sections, and writing my own queries with org-ql or some such.  Nothing wrong with an RDBMS here, but probably overkill and having narratives around each product that you don't have think about data-modeling for may be more useful vs faster queries you don't have to plumb.
Apr 10 16:35:39 <quiliro>	I am using a table on org-mode
Apr 10 16:35:49 <Twist>	quiliro: Not for long.
Apr 10 16:36:11 <rpav>	mplsCorwin: yeah that would work .. or like, a wiki-esque setup
Apr 10 16:36:13 <rpav>	if it's all just descriptive
Apr 10 16:36:20 <quiliro>	I only have 200 products now
Apr 10 16:36:33 <quiliro>	but it will get to about 200
Apr 10 16:36:34 <quiliro>	2000
Apr 10 16:36:40 <rpav>	does org-mode act as a wiki? i.e. pages that can trivially link to others by name?
Apr 10 16:37:19 <mplsCorwin>	quiliro: I think the number of starting products is more vial then the potential size of the pool assuming you will personally do all data entry.  If you started with 2k I'd def write something to import, at which an RDBMS may be more attractive (e.g. to be able to use existing loader tools).
Apr 10 16:37:23 <quiliro>	is there an example of a database constructed with one product per file?
Apr 10 16:37:24 <grym>	rpav: you can do this, sure
Apr 10 16:38:29 <mplsCorwin>	there's a gnu project that has some emacs support for flat-file DB.  I forget the name but it handles relationships and semi structured data pretty reasonably and has query semantics already developed.
Apr 10 16:39:04 <quiliro>	so I have one product per file which contains links with the names of all providers of that product and each provider can have its own file with its contact details
Apr 10 16:39:12 <rpav>	you could just spit out org-mode whatever too if that suits you .. if you just want descriptions+link-to-producer/etc you wouldn't have much redundant data that way
Apr 10 16:39:21 <rpav>	or some other wiki format
Apr 10 16:39:28 <Twist>	quiliro: Those who fail to learn SQL are doomed to reimplement it. Poorly.
Apr 10 16:39:34 <mplsCorwin>	Recutils, I'm thinking of.
Apr 10 16:39:51 <quiliro>	I have used sql
Apr 10 16:39:57 <rpav>	i think the main question is how you want to consume the data
Apr 10 16:40:02 <quiliro>	but never on production
Apr 10 16:40:32 <mplsCorwin>	unless it's how you want to edit the data.  decided which of those is more driving is a great first step.
Apr 10 16:40:50 <grym>	mplsCorwin: recutils seems super interesting 
Apr 10 16:40:50 <rpav>	nah, because an editor is just a data consumer
Apr 10 16:41:03 <mplsCorwin>	rpav: ok, I can see that
Apr 10 16:41:04 <grym>	rpav: org-roam and org-brain are both other ways to do mappings like this 
Apr 10 16:41:08 <rpav>	but if you want to write other things that use/process the data, you're stuck 
Apr 10 16:41:18 <mplsCorwin>	org-brain is a pretty interesting suggestion
Apr 10 16:41:23 <grym>	and org-rifle if you tag stuff rigorously 
Apr 10 16:41:34 <quiliro>	I would like to have a report that tells me which are the providers of a certain product and be able to get hold of their contact details....and to make a lis of all the products I can buy from a certain provider
Apr 10 16:41:38 <rpav>	grym: sure probably
Apr 10 16:41:42 <rpav>	i'm not really an org-mode fan
Apr 10 16:41:50 <grym>	it's how i do my notes 
Apr 10 16:41:54 <grym>	but i have yet to cult further
Apr 10 16:42:26 <rpav>	reporting sounds the the job for a db ;/
Apr 10 16:42:45 <quiliro>	oh....because of select *
Apr 10 16:42:48 <rpav>	otherwise, you end up hacking a db on top of a not-db, when you could more easily go the other way
Apr 10 16:42:52 <quiliro>	from *
Apr 10 16:42:55 <quiliro>	in *
Apr 10 16:43:01 <Twist>	quiliro: you can use org-babel with several DB back ends.
Apr 10 16:43:16 <Twist>	quiliro: Run a query in a code block, and get the output as an org table right back into your document.
Apr 10 16:43:29 <mplsCorwin>	This is sounding more and more like a BBDB to me.  Maybe driving insert/update from changes to org-mode sources if there's a narrative or other data worth keeping outside the contact list.
Apr 10 16:44:04 <mplsCorwin>	Or yea, recutil may well be perfect for this.
Apr 10 16:44:12 <quiliro>	I can make a list of products from ledger-mode
Apr 10 16:44:26 <quiliro>	I can make a list of providers from org mode too
Apr 10 16:44:46 <quiliro>	ledger-mode I meant
Apr 10 16:45:18 <mplsCorwin>	quiliro: what I'm getting from this convo is there are quite a few reasonable ways to do this.  Maybe make a list of what you need to be able to do in order of importance and then you can pick based on how much work you want to make of it.
Apr 10 16:45:22 <quiliro>	I don't know how to make a list of products that come from a certain provider
Apr 10 16:46:42 <quiliro>	I don't know how to make the list of provider contact details
Apr 10 16:47:11 <quiliro>	I mean the contact details of each provider
Apr 10 16:47:32 <mplsCorwin>	Something is going to have to compare the sets, I guess.  If you use an RDBMS (even recutil) the DB is that thing.  If you roll something in emacs then you'll need to write that function, including sourcing the data, performing the calculations/comparisons, and doing the right thing with the output (show a buffer, make a file), etc.
Apr 10 16:48:46 <quiliro>	OK...thank you...I will try BBDB since it is integrated with Emacs and will work well with the ledger-mode reports
Apr 10 16:56:15 <mbrumlow>	I am trying to debug this :( -> Error running timer ‘exwm-input--update-focus-commit’: (wrong-type-argument window-live-p nil)
Apr 10 16:56:28 <mbrumlow>	How does it know it is the wrong type? 
Apr 10 17:12:38 <wasamasa>	lol, managing 2000 products with emacs
Apr 10 17:13:59 <codingquark>	Good morning!
Apr 10 17:14:11 <wasamasa>	FYI, fsbot uses bbdb for its many factoids
Apr 10 17:14:24 <wasamasa>	it's not fast by any means, just convenient
Apr 10 17:14:32 <bremner>	there's an endorsement :P
Apr 10 17:16:36 <codingquark>	My freedombox is not able to reach outside network, for some reason.
Apr 10 17:16:45 <codingquark>	Outside is able to reach it though
Apr 10 17:17:10 <wasamasa>	it has 15k entries
Apr 10 17:17:41 <bremner>	didn't someone make sqlite bindings for emacs?
Apr 10 17:19:56 <wasamasa>	emacsql is a thing
Apr 10 17:20:07 <wasamasa>	which shells out to a custom sqlite shell
Apr 10 17:20:20 <wasamasa>	which is terrible for obvious reasons
Apr 10 17:21:33 <wasamasa>	https://github.com/syohex/emacs-sqlite3 looks better
Apr 10 17:24:03 <Twist>	see also https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sql.html
Apr 10 17:26:16 <wasamasa>	and ob-sqlite
Apr 10 17:27:18 <codingquark>	I do use things like sql-mysql or postgresql
Apr 10 17:27:37 <codingquark>	They let me copy-pasta, and that's all I really need from them
Apr 10 17:28:29 <wasamasa>	I still think programmatic use of babel is a bad idea
Apr 10 17:29:10 <hodapp>	what other way is there to use it?
Apr 10 17:29:17 <wasamasa>	interactively, duh
Apr 10 17:29:23 <hodapp>	oh, I see what you mean
Apr 10 17:29:37 <wasamasa>	pressing C-c C-c in a source code block, then waiting until it inserts something below

Apr 10 17:56:12 <codingquark>	Huh, weird things with my network these days
Apr 10 17:56:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Since pandemic or before?
Apr 10 17:56:50 <codingquark>	Since last 2 days
Apr 10 17:57:23 <codingquark>	Today my static IP expired. And I spent 2 hours trying to figure out which service or router config is fucked up
Apr 10 17:57:48 <ldlework>	Anyone wanna play some Go?
Apr 10 18:00:18 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Might it be ISP-side?
Apr 10 18:00:35 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: certainly it was.
Apr 10 18:00:41 <codingquark>	Got it fixed, as well.
Apr 10 18:00:57 <codingquark>	Then, my router started to refuse assigning IPv4 to my RPi
Apr 10 18:00:57 <parsnip>	let's benchmark retail sites
Apr 10 18:01:04 <codingquark>	,greet parsnip
Apr 10 18:01:05 <fsbot>	Olá parsnip!
Apr 10 18:01:16 <parsnip>	i cut my hair yesterday >.<
Apr 10 18:01:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Oh, that's odd.
Apr 10 18:01:28 <codingquark>	ldlework: if I manage to stay awake long enough, I shall try
Apr 10 18:01:33 *	parsnip looks for a hat
Apr 10 18:01:49 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: it runs OpenWRT, so it is not some messy OS issue
Apr 10 18:01:49 <ldlework>	codingquark: you make an account at online-go.com at your leisure
Apr 10 18:01:51 <codingquark>	parsnip: super!
Apr 10 18:01:59 <codingquark>	What style?
Apr 10 18:02:05 <codingquark>	ldlework: okay, thanks
Apr 10 18:02:10 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Oh goody, tried resetting the DHCP server?
Apr 10 18:02:22 <parsnip>	i dug out my clippers i haven't used in like ten years
Apr 10 18:02:41 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I rebooted the router, which seem to have solved the issue.
Apr 10 18:03:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Well, that'd do it too. heh
Apr 10 18:03:15 <parsnip>	i think a 7 on top, then 6 5 4 near the edgeof top, 4 3 2 on sides, 2 1 near bottom
Apr 10 18:03:29 <parsnip>	i haven't actually gotten a good look at it
Apr 10 18:03:42 <parsnip>	it was jsut getting too thick
Apr 10 18:03:50 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: now it is not able to reach irc.oftc.net and I'm too lazy to check again.
Apr 10 18:03:58 <codingquark>	parsnip: sounds like a lot of work tbh
Apr 10 18:04:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: dig/kdig irc.oftc.net ; dig/kdig @1.1.1.1 irc.oftc.net
Apr 10 18:04:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: If you don't get results with your default DNS, then it's probably dns.
Apr 10 18:06:19 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: hmm, getting results with both
Apr 10 18:06:27 <codingquark>	So issues is with znc
Apr 10 18:07:10 <codingquark>	Amazing, now znc connected too
Apr 10 18:07:17 <codingquark>	Perhaps a lot of packets drops a while ago
Apr 10 18:08:21 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: thanks to you, it got fixed :)
Apr 10 18:08:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Didn't get beyond step-1 of debugging, but you're welcome all the asme.
Apr 10 18:09:55 <codingquark>	ha ha, indeed
Apr 10 18:10:33 <codingquark>	It's really late and I've been writing C for huawei chips all day long
Apr 10 18:10:34 <codingquark>	My brain is so dead, it did not want to think of dig before you mentioned it.
Apr 10 18:10:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh, fair. I know that feeling.
Apr 10 18:11:05 <wasamasa>	codingquark: why
Apr 10 18:11:14 <codingquark>	wasamasa: it is $WORK
Apr 10 18:11:15 <grym>	that sorghum won't harvest itself 
Apr 10 18:30:38 <codingquark>	Share your blog URLs, I shall add to feed if I haven't yet!
Apr 10 18:35:20 <sveit>	hello (tried this yesterday) i think i am hitting a bug in ivy-completing-read, but it seems like it would be so commmon/pervasive i am worried i am misinterpreting. when using ivy-completing-read with history and requiring match, ivy adds the last input, not the last completion, to the history. this is different than ido or the default completing-read, and messes up completion lists in applications.
Apr 10 18:35:48 <sveit>	Minimal example: https://pastebin.com/AKDhi1tg
Apr 10 18:38:00 <sveit>	the problem is that if you add a history variable, even if require-match is true, all these completion engines will add any element from history to the possible completions. if it is agreed this is a bug i can try to fix, but it seems somewhat embedded in the ivy-read function to do things this way
Apr 10 19:04:44 <markasoftware>	Are there any fuzzy matchers for IDO that support out-of-order matching? I.e, so that if I have a file named "2020-tax-reports.pdf", I will be able to find it with the search term "tax-2020"
Apr 10 19:04:47 <markasoftware>	i know helm and ivy are good at this
Apr 10 19:05:03 <markasoftware>	so far, i have tried flx-ido and ido-clever-match, neither works.
Apr 10 19:05:08 <markasoftware>	(by design)
Apr 10 19:06:20 <lxsameer>	hey folks, what's the equivalent of lisp `define` in elisp ? defvar ?
Apr 10 19:07:44 <spikemaster>	defvar and defun
Apr 10 19:07:59 <spikemaster>	and all the def* variations
Apr 10 19:08:49 <lxsameer>	cool 
Apr 10 19:08:55 <spikemaster>	defvar adn defun are split out i believe becuase elisp is a lisp2. variables and functions can have the same name so 2 defs are needed
Apr 10 19:09:40 <spikemaster>	the extra defs like "defcustom" are just some extra fancy ways to declare special things to wire them up with the emacs UI in a special way.

Apr 10 19:21:52 <lxsameer>	thanks man 
Apr 10 19:22:10 <spikemaster>	you may and to change apply to funcall.  looks like you are passing separate args rather than a list of args
Apr 10 19:22:42 <spikemaster>	and you may want to put a "," in front of docstring at the end of your macro
Apr 10 19:23:37 <spikemaster>	use macroexpand-1 to see what your macro actually expands to.
Apr 10 19:23:40 <spikemaster>	(macroexpand-1 '(defsystem blah-me (+ 1 1)))
Apr 10 19:24:09 <lxsameer>	sure
Apr 10 19:28:46 <mns>	Is there a way to take a space separated region and turn it into an org-table ? 
Apr 10 19:30:11 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Replace the spaces by | and press tab inside any of those?
Apr 10 19:31:14 <mns>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: actually its simpler then that.  Select region and do M-x org-table-create-or-convert-from-region.
Apr 10 19:31:36 <mns>	just found it.  sometimes I guess looking for functions helps
Apr 10 19:31:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh, neat.
Apr 10 19:32:14 <mns>	yeah I am surprised by the simplicity as well
Apr 10 20:11:45 <SLeePy1234>	Hi everyone, I'm learning elisp, going through the debugger documentation I found this
Apr 10 20:11:55 <SLeePy1234>	"edebug-all-forms controls whether eval-region should instrument any form, even non-defining forms"
Apr 10 20:12:10 <SLeePy1234>	may sound stupid, but what are forms?
Apr 10 20:12:23 <wasamasa>	top-level sexps
Apr 10 20:13:03 <mplsCorwin>	,sexp
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	sexp -- [0] an expression in lisp, also called a form
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	[1] (info "(elisp)Forms")
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	[2] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sexp
Apr 10 20:13:26 <wasamasa>	typically a (defun ...) or (defvar ...)
Apr 10 20:15:10 <bremner>	Lisp phreak: "Lisp doesn't have syntax". Also Lisp phreak: "Lisp has all these important forms"
Apr 10 20:16:35 <SLeePy1234>	I though edebug-all-defs already took care of defuns
Apr 10 20:16:54 <wasamasa>	hence why it refers to "non-defining forms"
Apr 10 20:17:11 <wasamasa>	like a (progn ...)
Apr 10 20:17:19 <SLeePy1234>	oh I see now
Apr 10 20:17:55 <SLeePy1234>	so progn steps would be skipped if edebug forms is nil?
Apr 10 20:18:01 <wasamasa>	,tias
Apr 10 20:18:02 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 10 20:20:54 <SLeePy1234>	thanks :) really appreciate it
Apr 10 20:21:57 <wasamasa>	the exact behavior is... funny
Apr 10 20:47:01 <daniele->	hi!
Apr 10 20:47:49 <daniele->	is there a way in elisp to unpack a list? in python I can do `a, b = 1, 2`. is there an equivalent in elisp?
Apr 10 20:48:27 <wasamasa>	there's a bunch of macros binding list items to variables
Apr 10 20:48:39 <wasamasa>	destructuring-bind, pcase, -let, ...
Apr 10 20:49:44 <daniele->	wasamasa: thanks. where can i look for documentation?
Apr 10 20:50:37 <wasamasa>	the first two are part of emacs
Apr 10 20:50:54 <wasamasa>	the latter is from a popular dependency
Apr 10 20:51:02 <wasamasa>	they all have excessive docstrings
Apr 10 20:51:20 <lxsameer>	what's the appropriate way to change a record ? aset ?
Apr 10 20:52:12 <daniele->	wasamasa: which popular dependency?
Apr 10 20:52:15 <wasamasa>	dash.el
Apr 10 20:54:30 <dale_>	lxsameer: Must be?  Does it work?
Apr 10 20:54:50 <wasamasa>	records are basically structs done right
Apr 10 20:55:02 <wasamasa>	use the accessors/setters defined for that record
Apr 10 20:55:20 <dale>	wasamasa: Where are those defined when you use (record)?
Apr 10 20:55:36 <dale>	wasamasa: I don't see that they get names?  Unlike with something such as cl-defstruct.
Apr 10 20:55:43 <wasamasa>	yes exactly
Apr 10 20:56:09 <tobiasBora>	Hello,
Apr 10 20:56:15 <dale>	Oh, OK, now I see.
Apr 10 20:56:19 <dale>	Just kidding, I dont
Apr 10 20:56:22 <daniele->	wasamasa: i would not call the docstring of cl-destructuring-bind extensive :)
Apr 10 20:56:37 <wasamasa>	for more details there's the CL info manual
Apr 10 20:56:38 <wasamasa>	and CLHS
Apr 10 20:56:43 <tobiasBora>	I'd like to know, how can I quickly jump in Helm to a given entry? I can see numbers in front of the entries but not sure how to select them.
Apr 10 20:57:41 <lxsameer>	daniele-:  yeah it does, but there might be a better function to do it 
Apr 10 20:57:57 <daniele->	lxsameer: ?
Apr 10 20:58:26 <daniele->	i actually like -let better
Apr 10 20:59:02 <lxsameer>	daniele-: well, i thought there might be a set of functions dedicated to records
Apr 10 20:59:33 <daniele->	lxsameer: records? i think you are confused
Apr 10 20:59:52 <dale>	lxsameer: I think you meant to direct that to me, perhaps.
Apr 10 21:01:18 <lxsameer>	ah yeah sorry folks, totally confused the nicks
Apr 10 21:02:16 <dale>	lxsameer: ISTR I tried to use records once.  I don't see any evidence that I'm still using them today, so I'm guessing I switched to either cl-defstruct or else just lists/vectors.
Apr 10 21:03:36 <wasamasa>	hm, I thought of the #s(...) objects cl-defstruct returns
Apr 10 21:03:49 <lxsameer>	dale: i'm using cl-defstruct as well, apparently they're using records internally 
Apr 10 21:03:55 <wasamasa>	oh, these are records
Apr 10 21:04:01 <wasamasa>	why not #r(...) then
Apr 10 21:04:03 <dale>	Yeah, docs suggest cl-defstruct is just returning records.
Apr 10 21:04:07 <lxsameer>	dale: do you use setf to change the struct fields ?
Apr 10 21:04:16 <wasamasa>	> A “record” is much like a ‘vector’.
Apr 10 21:04:31 <wasamasa>	you can use aset, but really, use the accessors/setters defined by cl-defstruct
Apr 10 21:04:34 <dale>	lxsameer: Yes.
Apr 10 21:04:39 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: the name caused me a bit of confusion
Apr 10 21:04:41 <wasamasa>	don't break encapsulation
Apr 10 21:04:44 <lxsameer>	dale: cool thanks mate
Apr 10 21:05:19 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: does it actually create setters as well ?
Apr 10 21:05:29 <wasamasa>	if you tell it to
Apr 10 21:06:16 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ow , didn't know it. thanks
Apr 10 21:07:04 <wasamasa>	how else would the setf with an accessor form work?
Apr 10 21:10:32 <wasamasa>	it turns out the generated setter is a compiler macro to convert the setf form into an aset call with the right index
Apr 10 21:10:39 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: i'm a bit confused here, setf sets the value of the place to the given value right 
Apr 10 21:11:13 <wasamasa>	setf expands an accessor form to the equivalent setter form
Apr 10 21:11:53 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ahhh, so basically (cl-defstruct person name) with create an accessor person-name which using setf
Apr 10 21:12:03 <wasamasa>	for most stuff it's a trivial translation, like car -> setcar
Apr 10 21:12:05 <lxsameer>	it would be like (setf (person-name p) asdasd)
Apr 10 21:12:35 <wasamasa>	but in this case (person-name p) is turned into (aset p ...)
Apr 10 21:13:22 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: now i get it 
Apr 10 21:13:26 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: thanks a lot 
Apr 10 21:14:10 <wasamasa>	which means that unlike with the car -> setcar example, one cannot cleverly avoid the use of setf and would need to count slots instead
Apr 10 21:14:27 <wasamasa>	which I cannot recommend :>
Apr 10 21:14:41 <aidalgol>	Naming anything you make using words like "do what I mean", "sensible", or "smart" is just tempting fate.
Apr 10 21:14:50 <aidalgol>	e.g. split-window-sensibly
Apr 10 21:15:06 <wasamasa>	:D
Apr 10 21:15:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Good move not naming shackle something like "smart windows".
Apr 10 21:15:39 <wasamasa>	thank you
Apr 10 21:16:01 <aidalgol>	rudybot: wait, was that a back-handed compliment?
Apr 10 21:16:07 <rudybot>	aidalgol: "back-handed compliment"
Apr 10 21:20:20 <cvandusen>	rudybot: can you calculate two's back-handed complement? 
Apr 10 21:20:30 <rudybot>	cvandusen: that's a backhanded complement
Apr 10 21:23:54 <tobiasBora>	Another question, I'm trying to use use-package to set the display-line-number to nil in shell mode: http://paste.debian.net/1139609
Apr 10 21:24:00 <tobiasBora>	however it does not work
Apr 10 21:24:11 <tobiasBora>	Do I need to use hooks, or is there any better alternative?
Apr 10 21:25:55 <cvandusen>	Could you narrow down the paste? It's hard to parse that for the relevant code.
Apr 10 21:26:02 <dale>	tobiasBora: That's a big paste, I'm looking at the very bottom.  I think maybe you want to call (display-line-numbers-mode -1) in a shell-mode-hook function.
Apr 10 21:26:17 <dale>	tobiasBora: So, yes, add a hook.
Apr 10 21:26:31 <dale>	tobiasBora: (I mean that in the general Emacs sense, I don't know use-package very well.)
Apr 10 21:26:40 <tobiasBora>	dale: oh, I'm very sorry, I wanted to paste only the last part
Apr 10 21:27:05 <dale>	tobiasBora: The least you could have done was left some juicy logins/passwords in there too, sheesh.
Apr 10 21:28:05 <cvandusen>	Never thinking of others...
Apr 10 21:29:10 <tobiasBora>	ahah I'm sorry ^^
Apr 10 21:29:22 <tobiasBora>	So I tried that, but it still does not work http://paste.debian.net/1139612
Apr 10 21:29:46 <tobiasBora>	I'll try with display-line-numbers-mode instead
Apr 10 21:29:49 <dale>	tobiasBora: I would try (display-line-numbers-mode -1) instead of setq
Apr 10 21:30:09 <dale>	In this specific case I'm surprised it makes a difference, but I haven't looked at that code in a while.
Apr 10 21:30:09 <tobiasBora>	dale: indeed it works... But why? 
Apr 10 21:31:03 <dale>	tobiasBora: The only extra thing I see it doing is removing a pre-command-hook.  Maybe that's important.
Apr 10 21:31:12 <tobiasBora>	I don't understand why if I evaluate (setq display-line-numbers nil) it works, but if it's in the hook it fails
Apr 10 21:31:34 <tobiasBora>	dale: who is doing that?
Apr 10 21:31:39 <dale>	tobiasBora: But since you were doing (global-display-line-numbers-mode) to turn it on, I thought it was polite to turn it off with a function as well.
Apr 10 21:32:07 <dale>	tobiasBora: (display-line-numbers-mode -1), M-x find-function RET display-line-numbers-mode RET to see source.
Apr 10 21:32:14 <cvandusen>	Do you know if the code in the hook is being executed?
Apr 10 21:32:49 <dale>	When do global minor mode initializers run, before or after major mode hooks?
Apr 10 21:32:54 <dale>	I think before.
Apr 10 21:33:26 <tobiasBora>	cvandusen: well I guess it should if when I replace it with display-line-*-mode it works no?
Apr 10 21:34:08 <tobiasBora>	how, you mean that the global hook sets the variable, but then the minor mode display-line resets it?
Apr 10 21:34:14 <dale>	tobiasBora: FWIW, in your code that was NOT using a hook, you were only executing that (setq) form once, the first time something caused 'shell to be loaded.
Apr 10 21:34:46 <dale>	tobiasBora: And that setq under :config was being run in who-knows-what current buffer.
Apr 10 21:35:20 <dale>	Doesn't use-package require packages by default?  If so, (use-package shell :config (setq ...)) would run the setq with *scratch* as the current buffer.
Apr 10 21:35:46 <cvandusen>	It runs :config when the package is loaded. 
Apr 10 21:36:06 <dale>	Right, but isn't use-package-always-defer nil by default, some variable like that?
Apr 10 21:36:44 <dale>	Oh, it's more complicated than that, I forgot.
Apr 10 21:38:41 <dale>	But in this case, I believe tobiasBora originally had just (use-package shell :config (setq...)).  Without one of the other use-package keywords, I believe that means shell will be loaded immediately by use-package.
Apr 10 21:39:14 <dale>	tobiasBora: So I bet your original setq, without a hook, was setting display-line-numbers-mode in *scratch*, at Emacs startup.  (And then the value was killed when *scratch* was probably put into lisp-interaction-mode.)
Apr 10 21:40:02 <dale>	tobiasBora: Now, why your hook with (setq ...) didn't work, that is a mystery.
Apr 10 21:41:39 <dale>	tobiasBora: My first guess is that it works but you made a mistake in testing.  My second guess is that the pre-command-hook I mentioned was left on, and that somehow turns line numbers back on when it runs.
Apr 10 21:46:59 <fishyfriend>	hi #emacs! shameless plug for a new package: https://gitlab.com/fishyfriend_/execute-other-window
Apr 10 21:47:05 <fishyfriend>	(hope that's ok here)
Apr 10 21:49:42 <aidalgol>	Emacs in #emacs?  Outrageous!!
Apr 10 21:49:52 <MerlinTheWizard>	Hi all.
Apr 10 21:50:02 <fishyfriend>	:)
Apr 10 21:50:12 <MerlinTheWizard>	I'm trying to learn emacs, and that means I need to learn emacs info...
Apr 10 21:50:39 <MerlinTheWizard>	So I type C-h i and end up in info.
Apr 10 21:51:16 <MerlinTheWizard>	I type C-x C-f and open the info.info.<somethingorother>
Apr 10 21:51:44 <MerlinTheWizard>	And it says if you are new to the Info reader, type 'h' now.
Apr 10 21:51:49 <MerlinTheWizard>	So I type 'h'.
Apr 10 21:52:01 <aidalgol>	Don't do that.  Navigate to info manuals from the directory (the buffer C-h i brings you to).
Apr 10 21:52:17 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, ok, so what did I do wrong?
Apr 10 21:52:33 <aidalgol>	C-x C-f
Apr 10 21:52:41 <MerlinTheWizard>	This page here says to use 'C-x C-f':
Apr 10 21:52:44 <aidalgol>	You don't want to use that to navigate info.
Apr 10 21:52:46 <aidalgol>	Which page?
Apr 10 21:52:50 <MerlinTheWizard>	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InfoMode
Apr 10 21:53:15 <MerlinTheWizard>	It doesn't say the standard way at all.
Apr 10 21:53:20 <ahungry>	On some Emacs/OS setup, I notice my default "C-h i" info TOC is quite sparse
Apr 10 21:53:33 <ahungry>	To fix it so I get the same TOC as the CLI "info" call, I set these
Apr 10 21:53:35 <ahungry>	(add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "/usr/share/info")
Apr 10 21:53:42 <ahungry>	and also /usr/local/share/info
Apr 10 21:53:59 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: That's only for info manuals not on the default info path.  "Suppose you want to read an Info manual that is not in your InfoPath"
Apr 10 21:54:00 <ahungry>	there is an INFOPATH env var as well
Apr 10 21:54:05 <noobly>	Blackbeard: the reboot has gotten me much closer! 
Apr 10 21:54:09 <MerlinTheWizard>	So did I navigate to the incorrect file, or set info into the wrong 'mode', or what?
Apr 10 21:54:13 <dale>	MerlinTheWizard: Did you do the rest of the steps there, after the C-x C-f?  In particular M-x Info-on-current-buffer RET for example?
Apr 10 21:54:15 <aidalgol>	ahungry: Those should be in the default path list.  Something is wrong.
Apr 10 21:54:31 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: Let's back up.  What are you trying to do?
Apr 10 21:54:43 <dale>	MerlinTheWizard: Probably ignore me and listen to aidalgol.
Apr 10 21:54:46 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, learn info.
Apr 10 21:54:48 <ahungry>	Yea, I'm not sure, as they exist in INFOPATH as you'd expect 
Apr 10 21:55:17 <MerlinTheWizard>	I just want to know what's wrong. Did I put emacs info into the wrong state, navigate to the wrong file, or what?
Apr 10 21:55:32 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: OK, there's too much to try learning everything it can do at first.  Just try navigating the Emacs and Elisp manuals normally.
Apr 10 21:56:10 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, I got you on that. But can you or someone else answer my question please?
Apr 10 21:56:47 <MerlinTheWizard>	The file is info.info.gz. So is that the wrong file, or is it in the wrong mode, or what?
Apr 10 21:56:48 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: It doesn't look like you did anything wrong, but I would avoid using C-x C-f to open info manuals.
Apr 10 21:57:01 <aidalgol>	Yeah, you didn't need to do that step.
Apr 10 21:57:16 <aidalgol>	That would have opened the raw info source file.
Apr 10 21:57:36 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidolgol, no problem. But why doesn't info respond correctly. Am I even in info? The modeline says (Fundamental)...
Apr 10 21:57:47 <aidalgol>	You're not; that's why.
Apr 10 21:58:04 <MerlinTheWizard>	Okie doke, so I'm not in info mode. Ok, I get it.
Apr 10 21:58:31 <aidalgol>	I think dale was right about M-x Info-on-current-buffer being what would get you into info mode from there, but that's a roundabout way of getting to built-in documentation.
Apr 10 21:59:12 <MerlinTheWizard>	I agree. So I'll try to do it the correct way now.
Apr 10 21:59:39 <aidalgol>	ahungry: Which OS is this?
Apr 10 22:00:20 <MerlinTheWizard>	Ok, so I'm at the top level directory. Is there a quick way to get to the info info manual from here? Should I just search, or is there a shortcut?
Apr 10 22:00:51 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: Type h
Apr 10 22:01:08 <MerlinTheWizard>	Ah, ok aidalgol, thanks
Apr 10 22:01:25 <aidalgol>	Also, how's King Arthur these days?
Apr 10 22:01:40 <MerlinTheWizard>	I'm not sure right now. 
Apr 10 22:01:46 <MerlinTheWizard>	I haven't seen him in a long time.
Apr 10 22:02:06 <dale>	Probably social distancing.
Apr 10 22:02:25 <MerlinTheWizard>	Sensible hypothesis, dale.
Apr 10 22:08:43 <parsnip>	is holiday a neutral term?
Apr 10 22:09:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	In etymology, no.
Apr 10 22:09:42 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	https://www.etymonline.com/word/holiday
Apr 10 22:11:26 <tobiasBora>	dale: ok, I have no idea... Thanks for your help!
Apr 10 22:15:32 <bpalmer>	rudybot: stick a sword in a rock and we'll figure out some sort of reward for whomever draws it out later. 
Apr 10 22:15:53 <rudybot>	bpalmer: thanks to whomever recommended "ergo proxy"; I like the first two episodes at least.
Apr 10 22:16:24 <bpalmer>	rudybot: proxy voting is a poor substitute for a truly distributed electoral system.
Apr 10 22:16:29 <rudybot>	bpalmer: yeah, politically controlled voting districts are not sane, nor is the Electoral College process
Apr 10 22:17:01 <parsnip>	rudybot: later tell twb hi is there a more neutral term you prefer over \"holiday\"?
Apr 10 22:17:01 <rudybot>	parsnip: I asked `MemoServ' to forward the message to twb.
Apr 10 22:17:28 <bpalmer>	parsnip: what do you mean by neutral?
Apr 10 22:18:18 <parsnip>	bpalmer: like, i just like getting paid to not work, i want to say, "happy exemption day" to coworkers, without a reference to some sort of holiness
Apr 10 22:18:20 <grym>	 bpalmer: pH 7
Apr 10 22:18:38 <bpalmer>	happy paid time off day!
Apr 10 22:18:40 <grym>	parsnip: holiday is nonsectarian anyway
Apr 10 22:18:56 <bpalmer>	holiday may be associated with religion, but isn't particularly associated with *a* religion.
Apr 10 22:19:13 <parsnip>	yeah, holiday is /somewhat/ neutral
Apr 10 22:21:57 <grym>	parsnip: if it makes you feel better, "holy" and "whole" are very closely related ideas 
Apr 10 22:22:17 <grym>	and one can certainly speak of "good being-made-whole-ness" that is athiestic if you so choose
Apr 10 22:22:36 <parsnip>	"happy your day"
Apr 10 22:22:46 <wgreenhouse>	"nefarious" comes from conducting business on days where it was forbidden for religious reasons in the Roman calendar (dies nefasti)
Apr 10 22:22:53 <grym>	holiness and "set-apart-ness" are also related; cf also 'sacrifice' which doesn't necessarily mean what you think 
Apr 10 22:23:03 <wgreenhouse>	not giving time off is nefarious. I like that :)
Apr 10 22:23:10 <parsnip>	happy mind your own business day
Apr 10 22:23:23 <bpalmer>	as long as it doesn't mean me, I'm happy sacrificing anything.
Apr 10 22:23:35 <grym>	bpalmer: yeah that's the potentially not so great sense :) 
Apr 10 22:24:22 <grym>	but this is, uh, an interesting theological debate more than a usage conversation

Apr 10 22:37:14 <rpav>	wow i failed
Apr 10 22:37:24 <rpav>	sigh, long day
Apr 10 22:39:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rpav: Yeah, Ergo Proxy's good. Might care for Texnolyze

Apr 10 22:39:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rudybot: 
Apr 10 22:39:47 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	sorry rpav 
Apr 10 22:41:01 <rpav>	texnolyze D:
Apr 10 22:41:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rpav: Don't like it?
Apr 10 22:42:50 <rpav>	i may have been too young to appreciate it or something, but all i remember was watching what i could only describe as the slowest and most non-eventful anime involving cyborg mafia (or yakuza or whatever specific crime syndicate) that is probably possible
Apr 10 22:46:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	heh, it wasn't quite that slow but yeah it's no shonen
Apr 10 22:47:43 <rpav>	i mostly appreciated slow/experiential stuff too, i mean .. i thought SEL was pretty neat heh
Apr 10 22:48:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	:3
Apr 10 22:49:23 <bpalmer>	SEL?
Apr 10 22:49:26 <rpav>	lain
Apr 10 22:49:29 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Serial Experiments Lain
Apr 10 22:49:44 <rpav>	i mean, i think stuff happened in that though .. it's been awhile
Apr 10 22:49:48 <bpalmer>	ah. I seem to recall that's the goto anime for talking about lisp's influence
Apr 10 22:49:55 <rpav>	hah really
Apr 10 22:50:38 <bpalmer>	See https://lain.wiki/wiki/Source_code (but C is also present, I guess)
Apr 10 22:50:47 <rpav>	ooh yeah
Apr 10 22:50:53 <bpalmer>	oh, mips-assembly
Apr 10 22:50:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Yeah. It also has a bunch of obscure early-Apple references.
Apr 10 22:51:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Remember NeXtStep?
Apr 10 22:51:26 <rpav>	quite
Apr 10 22:57:41 <bpalmer>	rudybot: that's one small nextstep for man
Apr 10 22:57:42 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Oh, I never found any information on him coding anything. I only saw a NeXTSTEP video on YouTube where he made a small app, and wasn't sure if he had just learned a bit for the demo.
Apr 10 23:22:38 <spikemaster>	is defstruct considered the best way to make structs in the lisp world?
Apr 10 23:23:36 <parsnip>	offby1: i found a good office supply store nearby: https://duckysofficefurniture.com/collections/all/products/test-product-1
Apr 10 23:40:19 <spudpnds>	Speaking of NeXTSTEP, WindowMaker 0.95.9 was released this month.
Apr 10 23:41:10 <gendl>	Hi, in emacs-26.3-x86_64/bin/, why is there both emacs.exe and emacs-26.3.exe, identical to each other, each taking up 136MB? 
Apr 10 23:41:21 <gendl>	can i delete one of these? 
Apr 10 23:42:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Are they hardlinked?
Apr 10 23:42:21 <gendl>	how could i tell? 
Apr 10 23:42:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	With stat they'd have the same inode number
Apr 10 23:42:34 <bremner>	ls -i iirc
Apr 10 23:42:48 <bremner>	although foo.exe sounds like windows
Apr 10 23:43:02 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Oh right. Missed that bit.
Apr 10 23:43:05 <gendl>	yes this is emacs  26.3 compiled for windows. 
Apr 10 23:43:48 <gendl>	from  https://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-26/
Apr 10 23:46:19 <gendl>	the main launch program is runemacs.exe
Apr 10 23:46:35 <gendl>	it seems i can blow away emacs-26.3.exe with no ill effect. 
Apr 10 23:46:36 <gendl>	runemacs.exe still works. 
Apr 10 23:46:55 <gendl>	but removing emacs.exe breaks it. It looks like it's only using emacs.exe not emacs-26.3.exe.
Apr 10 23:48:37 <bremner>	it might not actually be using up extra space, but you'd need to ask a windows expert how to tell
Apr 10 23:49:01 <markasoftware>	What mechanism does electric-indent use to automatically re-indent a line ending with : when the : is typed?
Apr 10 23:49:23 <gendl>	bremner:  well it sure it using extra space in my build, where the built files end up on a Linux system. 
Apr 10 23:49:34 <gendl>	according to du -sk it's using plenty of extra space. 
Apr 10 23:49:38 <markasoftware>	the colon is not in electric-indent-chars and there's no electric-indent-functions
Apr 10 23:50:10 <markasoftware>	or rather, electric-indent-chars is set to (10), which seems like just the newline.
Apr 10 23:50:24 <gendl>	my whole build is ending up as 700-odd MB just for an emacs and a little common lisp program. 
Apr 10 23:50:35 <gendl>	things have become bloated beyond belief. 
Apr 10 23:51:09 <parsnip>	why would you put a .exe on linux?
Apr 10 23:51:40 <parsnip>	let me rephrase that. are you putting a .exe on linux?
Apr 10 23:52:00 <markasoftware>	the only thing i can find is that electric-indent-mode-hook is bound to c-electric-indent-mode-hook, but i would still imagine that it has to set electric-indent-chars to be able to do anything
Apr 10 23:52:22 <gendl>	because i'm running a distributed build system where a "manager" program running on a Linux host ends up managing the files
Apr 10 23:52:53 <gendl>	a linux host which is also running Gitlab CI fires off builds on Linux, Mac, and Windows, then collects all the resultant installer files. 
Apr 10 23:53:34 <gendl>	which for Windows means both a .zip version and a setup .exe made with Inno Setup. 
Apr 10 23:53:39 <parsnip>	wow, i had to uninstall amazon app to get it to stop showing blank pages
Apr 10 23:54:01 <parsnip>	there's even a review suggesting even "uninstalling update" didn't fix. i had tried clearing cache
Apr 10 23:54:09 <parsnip>	i wonder if clearing data would have fixed it
Apr 10 23:54:30 <gendl>	and those install .zip and .exe are getting incredibly bloated, so i'm going through trying to see where the main bloat is coming from.. 
Apr 10 23:55:38 <parsnip>	it seems like you want the "alpine linux" of emacs builds
Apr 10 23:55:53 <bremner>	I guess the windows binary must include a bunch of libraries that are shared on linux. I think the installed size is less than 50MB on linux
Apr 10 23:56:18 <bremner>	well, ok, closer to 100M with lisp files
Apr 10 23:56:18 <gendl>	parsnip: indeed.
Apr 10 23:56:23 <bremner>	but that's unpacked
Apr 10 23:57:25 <gendl>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/OBeN1eV7/
Apr 10 23:57:44 <gendl>	309MB and that's with the superfluous emacs-26.3.exe removed. 
Apr 10 23:58:12 <greenline>	speaking of WindowMaker, I was sad this did not continue: http://etoileos.com/etoile/
Apr 10 23:58:52 <gendl>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mwiN5ktT/
Apr 10 23:59:25 <gendl>	The share/emacs directory is 132MB - I don't see how the entire Linux install can be 100MB including binaries. 
Apr 10 23:59:46 <gendl>	unless for some reason the Windows one comes with a ton more lisp files. 
Apr 10 23:59:53 <ecbrown>	98MB is gnus 
Apr 11 00:00:18 <bremner>	it's possible. the uncompiled lisp files are about 17MB. Anyway I just did quick guestimate, so *shrug*
Apr 11 00:00:46 <bremner>	(and I didn't include the uncompiled lisp files in my estimate)
Apr 11 00:02:05 <ecbrown>	(i was just kidding, by the way)

Apr 11 00:19:39 <ecbrown>	intuition of a greybeard
Apr 11 00:25:43 <parsnip>	heh, "quarantine" means "40 days"

Apr 11 00:29:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Quarantine is derived from quarante, but it's not limited by its etymology.
Apr 11 00:29:25 <parsnip>	it is interesting that our lockdown has been approximately 15 + 30 = 45
Apr 11 00:29:43 <parsnip>	yeah, fsvo "means"

Apr 11 00:30:11 <parsnip>	i needed a catchy headline
Apr 11 00:31:20 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	So, I give up finding out what changed since Debian's package of Geiser and upstream's main.

Apr 11 01:43:13 <parsnip>	well, probably facebook fixed the problem, but figured out how to assess damages
Apr 11 01:43:20 <parsnip>	so like, overtime costs, etc
Apr 11 01:43:22 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, that's a shame.
Apr 11 01:43:27 <parsnip>	just guessing
Apr 11 01:43:39 <parsnip>	but if i was a lawyer, that's what i would think
Apr 11 01:43:47 <parsnip>	QED
Apr 11 01:45:07 <parsnip>	i think facebook also got a lot of heat for reacting and catching false positives, so maybe they can put a price on that too
Apr 11 01:45:21 <parsnip>	if i'm right that the two are related
Apr 11 01:54:55 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I'm not too fond of such networks.
Apr 11 01:59:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh. Was the change realy just in Geiser's scheme/guile/geiser/emacs.scm's ` (define·​(compile*·​form·​module-​name·​opts)​'
Apr 11 01:59:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	8 lines of change. That's what was breaking for me I'm pretty sure.

Apr 11 08:53:22 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Apr 11 09:13:21 <parsnip>	i just got a pop up on a web site, "Right Click blocked for business policy!"
Apr 11 09:13:34 <parsnip>	at http://www.bonettocinturini.it/en/catalogo/catalogo.php?page=3
Apr 11 09:14:13 <andinus>	try pressing alt, should override that
Apr 11 09:14:21 <andinus>	or maybe ctrl, i just disable that feature
Apr 11 09:14:37 <parsnip>	cmd+click does what i meant anyways
Apr 11 09:28:58 <roadie>	parsnip: very cool popup, I had to enable javascript to see it
Apr 11 09:29:18 <roadie>	so its opt-in
Apr 11 09:36:01 <codingquark>	wasamasa: I'm reading your gopher hole, and sometimes I feel I should ditch my stupid html blog and simply server gopher and rss
Apr 11 09:36:05 <parsnip>	i give up on picking a rubber strap for now. i'll order a cheap one after i get the watch.
Apr 11 09:36:21 <codingquark>	parsnip: do you dislike canvas straps?
Apr 11 09:36:27 <parsnip>	$50 on left, $550 on right: https://imgur.com/oKkrtlp
Apr 11 09:37:14 <parsnip>	codingquark: i think most will be floppy, because i like to wear my strap a little loose. rubber seems to hold it's shape better when loose.
Apr 11 09:37:28 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 11 09:37:48 <parsnip>	also, rubber seems easier to keep clean
Apr 11 09:38:00 <codingquark>	For sure
Apr 11 09:38:39 <parsnip>	maybe one day i'll try to get into the canvas, but i'm just assuming for now i won't like it.
Apr 11 09:39:33 <parsnip>	i bought some victorinox field watch thing a few years ago, and immediately returned it because i was surprised at how flimsy it was
Apr 11 09:40:14 <codingquark>	:O
Apr 11 09:40:37 <parsnip>	maybe one day i'll buy a really nice canvas strap and love it
Apr 11 09:40:51 <parsnip>	or w/e they're made of
Apr 11 10:05:28 <monotux>	I'm on 26.3, but I can't seem to use sieve-mode. it logins OK and when I try to follow a file to see it, it just hangs. if I abort (C-g) I can see the sieve file printed in the sieve-manage-log, but I can't upload my changes or create a new file. does anyone know anything more about this?
Apr 11 10:05:37 <monotux>	I'm compiling a mail to the maintainer
Apr 11 10:11:27 <fifi-v>	hi, how do I compose a ivy regex to match "ac" or "ad" or "bc" or "bd"?  (ivy--regex-plus "[ab][cd]") returns "\\([ab]\\).*?\\([cd]\\)", which means things like "aXXXc" will be matched too, which is unwanted.
Apr 11 10:21:30 <codingquark>	wasamasa: revision is on, quite nice actually
Apr 11 10:22:55 <wasamasa>	I dunno whether putting your blog on gopher is a good idea
Apr 11 10:23:08 <wasamasa>	same with self-hosting your git stuff :D
Apr 11 10:24:45 <codingquark>	Oh right, you've been on it since last week IIRC
Apr 11 10:24:48 <codingquark>	(at least)
Apr 11 10:25:10 <wasamasa>	yeah, I'm slowly coding up everything needed
Apr 11 10:25:35 <wasamasa>	so far the parts to export/initialize repos are done, currently figuring out how to statically generate pages with readme, file listing, usage instructions, ...
Apr 11 10:25:54 <wasamasa>	it turns out that my choice of mostly using rst and occasionally org/md wasn't that good :D
Apr 11 10:26:04 <wasamasa>	because rst is only properly implemented with python
Apr 11 10:26:10 <wasamasa>	and org with emacs
Apr 11 10:26:35 <wasamasa>	whereas only markdown allows me the necessary freedom for fancy postprocessing
Apr 11 10:27:55 <codingquark>	Shouldn't something like pandoc give more flex there?
Apr 11 10:28:08 <wasamasa>	I want to do it all in scheme
Apr 11 10:28:37 <wasamasa>	my blogs use rst and it sure takes time with all the shelling out
Apr 11 10:28:56 <codingquark>	Hmm
Apr 11 10:29:16 <wasamasa>	I wouldn't want to install pandoc on a server either, too many dependencies
Apr 11 10:29:27 <codingquark>	BTW, "Intriguing texts found on the web" do not refer back to OP, do they?
Apr 11 10:29:35 <wasamasa>	no
Apr 11 10:29:51 <codingquark>	pandoc is big
Apr 11 10:29:53 <wasamasa>	but the title is sufficient to find them again if needed
Apr 11 10:30:04 <wasamasa>	it's funny how the title won over the purl idea
Apr 11 10:31:51 <codingquark>	How?
Apr 11 10:32:12 <wasamasa>	by ease of use I guess
Apr 11 10:32:44 <codingquark>	Sure
Apr 11 10:33:00 <codingquark>	Fascinating one, on user-agents
Apr 11 10:33:14 <codingquark>	Now reading "On electronic wastefulness"
Apr 11 10:33:23 <codingquark>	And listening to the demoscene in the bg
Apr 11 10:33:46 <wasamasa>	copying or screenshotting the title is less work than figuring out some link that will survive linkrot :D
Apr 11 10:33:49 <codingquark>	Thinking if I should setup speakers in bedroom instead of study and listen that way.
Apr 11 10:34:09 <codingquark>	Linkrot is an important point.
Apr 11 10:34:30 <codingquark>	And pointing to archive links every time manually is pain
Apr 11 10:43:55 <aidalgol>	Can someone explain this reference from this week's n-gate for me?  "A webshit manages to question the React/javascript hypostatic union without provoking a Nestorian crisis."
Apr 11 10:46:15 <wasamasa>	I guess they mean that Nest controversy
Apr 11 10:48:26 <aidalgol>	Oh, that's less exciting.
Apr 11 10:49:15 <codingquark>	lol
Apr 11 10:49:28 <wasamasa>	I recall a hackernews piece on how web developers should not be allowed to build smoke detectors
Apr 11 10:50:12 <codingquark>	Oh no, in the name of democratizing tech, we are going to make interfaces for anyone and everyone to do everything
Apr 11 10:50:57 <wasamasa>	where the first mistake is to run a whole linux system :D
Apr 11 10:50:59 <aidalgol>	Does the verb "democratize" have any valid etymology, or did some writer pull it out of their ass one day?
Apr 11 10:51:18 <codingquark>	Interesting question
Apr 11 10:51:41 <codingquark>	Deciding, however, on a system other than linux will be the second mistake?
Apr 11 10:51:52 <codingquark>	I suppose the keyword there was "whole"
Apr 11 10:51:56 <wasamasa>	yeah
Apr 11 10:52:09 <aidalgol>	Let's just run FORTH on Arduinos.
Apr 11 10:52:12 <wasamasa>	smoke detectors should ideally be a simple circuit
Apr 11 10:52:21 <wasamasa>	going for a microcontroller is pushing it
Apr 11 10:52:31 <aidalgol>	hold up.  nest had a smoke detector??
Apr 11 10:52:31 <fsbot>	I'm telling you, you don't want to know.
Apr 11 10:52:33 <wasamasa>	and anything beyond that requiring an OS with internet connectivity, good luck
Apr 11 10:52:39 <aidalgol>	what the ever-loving fuck.
Apr 11 10:52:40 <wasamasa>	they did all kinds of home stuff
Apr 11 10:53:01 <aidalgol>	How does the Internet of Things^WShit keep on surprising me?
Apr 11 10:53:37 <aidalgol>	I thought you meant don't run linux for end-user PCs.
Apr 11 10:54:36 <codingquark>	But then how will I turn my lights on from my bed?
Apr 11 10:54:48 <aidalgol>	codingquark: AFAICT, browser-side web dev is so hellish because the community has ADHD and can't settle on any one thing for more than a couple months, if that.
Apr 11 10:55:12 <codingquark>	word
Apr 11 10:55:13 <aidalgol>	STOP FUCKING WITH THE FRAMEWORKS
Apr 11 10:55:39 <wasamasa>	> On April 3, 2014, sales of the Nest Protect were suspended, due to the potential for the alarm feature to be accidentally disabled.[37] [38][39] 440,000 existing Nest Protect units were recalled because of this problem on May 21, 2014 and a software update was distributed to disable this functionality.[40][41]
Apr 11 10:55:41 <codingquark>	"The last major release was 1 year ago, this is dead"
Apr 11 10:55:54 <wasamasa>	the update functionality is a great excuse to half-ass whatever you launch
Apr 11 10:55:59 <wasamasa>	you can still fix it with an update
Apr 11 10:56:02 <wasamasa>	or so they thought :D
Apr 11 10:56:26 <aidalgol>	codingquark: I am guilty of looking at the last commit date as a litmus test for whether a given project is still kicking.
Apr 11 10:56:28 <codingquark>	If you don't think that way, then you're late to market and won't be the one monopolizing entity
Apr 11 10:56:46 <aidalgol>	But that's commit activity, not major release date.
Apr 11 10:56:47 <codingquark>	aidalgol: that's still perhaps acceptable.
Apr 11 10:56:50 <codingquark>	Right
Apr 11 10:57:08 <aidalgol>	And that's only my *first* measure, not my first and last.
Apr 11 10:57:33 <wasamasa>	here it is: https://gekk.info/articles/iot.html
Apr 11 10:57:40 <aidalgol>	For my hobby game dev, I'm using lua libs that have had hard any activity in recent years.
Apr 11 10:57:48 <wasamasa>	> This article has been linked on hacker news, far more visibility than I ever expected, and unsurprisingly someone in the comments says they worked on it and my accusations are unfounded and it doesn't run Linux.
Apr 11 10:58:11 <aidalgol>	I'd probably be using really old blender add-ons, too, if 2.8 hadn't just come out with breaking changes.
Apr 11 10:58:30 <wasamasa>	that kind of ruins the story
Apr 11 10:58:50 <codingquark>	wasamasa: well if it does not run Linux then it is probably even worse
Apr 11 10:59:14 <aidalgol>	The last paragraph of that intro is great, though.
Apr 11 10:59:20 <codingquark>	Like, who in their right mind would think that they're going to write a better bootloader than u-boot for PRODUCTION hardware?
Apr 11 10:59:22 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Yeah, it probably runs WinCE 7.
Apr 11 10:59:28 <codingquark>	ha ha
Apr 11 10:59:31 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Oh, oh!  I know!
Apr 11 10:59:39 <codingquark>	RMS?
Apr 11 11:00:52 <aidalgol>	They did for something at my job because u-boot being GPL'd meant that they couldn't put their own obfuscated signature-checking shit into it to prevent someone on the outside putting unsanctioned OS builds on it.
Apr 11 11:01:36 <codingquark>	That is indeed interesting
Apr 11 11:01:53 <aidalgol>	Frankly, I'm a little surprised that after the "I'm going to make my own club where I can do whatever I want and you're not invited" corporate rage rewrite that is known as toybox, we don't have an analogue for u-boot.
Apr 11 11:02:05 <codingquark>	Instead of realizing that weird-ass sig checking shit is a shit move
Apr 11 11:02:26 <wasamasa>	> With apologies to the late Mitch Hedberg, always design your device to fail like an escalator, not an elevator. When an escalator fails, it becomes stairs. When an elevator fails, it becomes jail.
Apr 11 11:02:42 <aidalgol>	Maybe because every vendor already NIH's their own shitty bootloater.
Apr 11 11:02:44 <wasamasa>	thanks Mitch, I guess I won't be enabling HSTS, ever
Apr 11 11:02:46 <codingquark>	Oh, nice one
Apr 11 11:03:04 <aidalgol>	codingquark: This product is full of half-baked "security" measures.
Apr 11 11:03:35 <aidalgol>	If it didn't have failsafes outside our control, it would be terrifying.
Apr 11 11:03:39 <codingquark>	aidalgol: do you feel half-backed is a larger problem than having (and thereby knowing) none-to-basic sec?
Apr 11 11:03:50 <wasamasa>	I like getting paid for pointing out to other companies they have half-baked "security" measures, even though their own staff already told them
Apr 11 11:04:04 <wasamasa>	that's the best part of being a consultant
Apr 11 11:04:06 <codingquark>	haha
Apr 11 11:04:54 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Yes, because it will not stop a determined user from reverse-engineering our stuff, or malicious actors from successfully attacking users installations, and it makes our job harder, all while providing a false sense of security, as well as ass-covering for execs.
Apr 11 11:04:54 <codingquark>	First the devs put the measures there, then they spoke about it, then nobody trusted them, so they hired you, then you got to say they are right.
Apr 11 11:05:09 <aidalgol>	Oh, no, we in engineering all think it's stupid.
Apr 11 11:05:10 <wasamasa>	half-baked security measures are dangerous if you believe they help you and stop striving to do better
Apr 11 11:05:23 <aidalgol>	Product management tell us to put it there.
Apr 11 11:05:58 <adgtl>	You can run the command ‘flycheck-credo-setup’ with M-x f-cr RET [2 times]
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	Am currently using this company config https://0x0.st/iSwd.el (copy/pasted) along with `company-flex.el` two have fuzzy search a la Sublime Text but still, am facing two issues:
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	1 - the order: (see image)
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	2 - fuzzy doesn't work for HTML file/buffer at all.
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	*NOTE*: I didn't test for other files beside elisp file*
Apr 11 11:06:01 <work_>	Is there I can add/remove to improve this?
Apr 11 11:06:01 <codingquark>	Make sure there is *some* password in the header. No need to validate it right now, will do as an update
Apr 11 11:06:09 <adgtl>	When I type -fcr nothing happens
Apr 11 11:06:12 <aidalgol>	work_: Too many lines at once.
Apr 11 11:06:15 <adgtl>	You can run the command ‘flycheck-credo-setup’ with M-x f-cr RET [2 times]
Apr 11 11:06:22 <work_>	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mS6erQtg/emacs-company-issue.png
Apr 11 11:06:32 <adgtl>	folks, emacs is giving me suggestions which don't work
Apr 11 11:06:37 <adgtl>	what is emacs doing? :D
Apr 11 11:06:45 <codingquark>	Trolling?
Apr 11 11:06:47 <fsbot>	[->] troll is [0/4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 11 11:06:48 <aidalgol>	And then when the senior engineers tell them what those requirements entail, they pick away at the proposal with a rusty scalpel until we have to implement something worse than nothing.
Apr 11 11:06:51 <adgtl>	M-x f-cr doesn't run that command
Apr 11 11:06:54 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: exactly
Apr 11 11:07:08 <wasamasa>	but having none isn't exactly better
Apr 11 11:07:12 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Think more obscure than that.
Apr 11 11:07:17 <wasamasa>	some baseline helps definitely
Apr 11 11:07:34 <wasamasa>	like ensuring a minimum of functionality, then ensuring a minimum of that is reachable
Apr 11 11:08:07 <wasamasa>	applying all security measures is lots of work and churn for not nearly as much benefit as that baseline
Apr 11 11:08:25 <andinus>	so lsp-find-definition is s-l g g, what does s mean here?
Apr 11 11:08:48 <aidalgol>	What's especially dumb about the DRM part is that most of our business is in servicing and a lock-in suite of products, and the industry has a creepy level of brand loyalty, so people tend to stick with whatever they bought in to.
Apr 11 11:09:25 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: It also helps if you have someone trying to poke holes in your shit.
Apr 11 11:09:40 <wasamasa>	that happens to be most of my job
Apr 11 11:09:42 <aidalgol>	The powers that be tend to go, "edge case. WONTFIX"
Apr 11 11:09:58 <wasamasa>	but it's in no way exhaustive
Apr 11 11:10:01 <adgtl>	(use-package
Apr 11 11:10:01 <adgtl>	  counsel
Apr 11 11:10:03 <adgtl>	  :ensure t
Apr 11 11:10:03 <adgtl>	  :bind ("M-x" . counsel-M-x)) 
Apr 11 11:10:09 <aidalgol>	Just for bugs and usability in general, not with security bugs in particular.
Apr 11 11:10:10 <adgtl>	but when I start emacs, M-x is bound to something else
Apr 11 11:10:13 <aidalgol>	,tell adgtl about paste.
Apr 11 11:10:14 <fsbot>	adgtl: try:  hpaste.el lisppaste.el openpaste.el paste2.el pastebin pastebin.ca pastebin.com pastebin.el pastebot
Apr 11 11:10:17 <aidalgol>	,tell adgtl about paste
Apr 11 11:10:17 <adgtl>	how to find out who is overriding it
Apr 11 11:10:18 <fsbot>	adgtl: Please do not paste mutiple lines of text into the channel. Use a paste service like http://ix.io/, webpaste.el or dpaste.com instead.
Apr 11 11:10:20 <wasamasa>	and relatively expensive work if you do it all the time for your products
Apr 11 11:10:43 <wasamasa>	some of that work could be avoided if you had sensible design before implementing that thing :D
Apr 11 11:10:43 <adgtl>	http://dpaste.com/1CJ3SDN
Apr 11 11:11:11 <adgtl>	folks, how to know my bind got overriden.. I am setting one but is not applied when I start emacs
Apr 11 11:11:11 <andinus>	adgtl: by bisecting your init?
Apr 11 11:11:26 <aidalgol>	Yeah, I second the bisect recommendation.
Apr 11 11:11:31 <adgtl>	andinus any simpler way?
Apr 11 11:11:49 <andinus>	idk
Apr 11 11:12:17 <andinus>	or just search for M-x in your init lol
Apr 11 11:12:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Let's just say that "architecture astronauts" comes to mind a fair bit here.
Apr 11 11:12:43 <andinus>	adgtl: if your init is overriding it then it should be there, also look in custom-file
Apr 11 11:12:56 <aidalgol>	What does C-h M-x say?
Apr 11 11:13:06 <aidalgol>	Er, not that...
Apr 11 11:13:13 <aidalgol>	C-h c M-x
Apr 11 11:14:19 <adgtl>	aidalgol my bad. I think I didn't load the related config in my init.el
Apr 11 11:14:22 <adgtl>	now it works fine
Apr 11 11:14:29 <aidalgol>	haha
Apr 11 11:14:39 <aidalgol>	fsbot: shoot adgtl
Apr 11 11:14:40 *	fsbot loads its slamhound and hunts down and blows up adgtl
Apr 11 11:17:50 <codingquark>	revisionparty people keep drinking coffee and it is no-coffee weekend for me.
Apr 11 11:18:58 <notnotdan>	why is it a no-coffee weekend codingquark ?
Apr 11 11:19:41 <codingquark>	notnotdan: to keep my brain from becoming addicted.

Apr 11 11:24:52 <codingquark>	No music for next 4hr?
Apr 11 11:24:53 <codingquark>	:(
Apr 11 11:25:03 <wasamasa>	or watch last year's stuff: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNqQO7lFY6dlIHKi5geI2faS00dzA0_2_
Apr 11 11:27:28 <codingquark>	I have forgotten one of my important passphrases and I've spent 2 hours since morning trying to recall
Apr 11 11:27:44 <codingquark>	So far, I have reached to the event in past when I had last typed it.
Apr 11 11:27:57 <codingquark>	I now have to take a break before I explore this further
Apr 11 11:32:10 <codingquark>	wasamasa: regarding On electronic wastefulness, perhaps situations like COVID-19 can push people towards relying on software more than hardware because hardware needs physical supplychain.
Apr 11 11:37:22 <lxsameer>	hey folks, how can i access the location (filename and line number) of where my macro is being called?
Apr 11 11:39:40 <wasamasa>	you can't
Apr 11 11:39:52 <wasamasa>	ask emacs-devel for better ideas
Apr 11 11:41:13 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ahh, i thought it might be like some other lisps
Apr 11 11:41:17 <lxsameer>	thanks
Apr 11 11:47:59 <mplsCorwin>	Hmm.  Seems to have been a bad idea to (let (print-depth print-level) (print giant-hash-table))  10% CPU, 40% RAM and shows no sign of stopping.
Apr 11 11:53:35 <ldlework>	mplsCorwin: oops
Apr 11 11:55:30 <bremner>	,gourds
Apr 11 11:55:32 <fsbot>	SQUEEZE THEM!!
Apr 11 11:59:03 <libertyprime>	ugh.. this is triving me nuts. why would (activate-mark) not work programmatically? (i.e. as part of an interactive function)
Apr 11 11:59:33 <mplsCorwin>	,call-interactively
Apr 11 11:59:34 <fsbot>	You have no real enemies.
Apr 11 11:59:35 <ldlework>	libertyprime: are you call-interactively?
Apr 11 11:59:47 <ldlework>	noob
Apr 11 11:59:53 <mplsCorwin>	shaddap
Apr 11 11:59:56 <ldlework>	:)
Apr 11 11:59:59 <mplsCorwin>	:)
Apr 11 12:00:57 <libertyprime>	idlework: sometimes i cant fathom my own noobness. nah i dont think it can be called that way 
Apr 11 12:01:45 <ldlework>	libertyprime: (activate-mark) works for me
Apr 11 12:02:41 <ldlework>	(progn (beginning-of-buffer) (activate-mark) (end-of-buffer))
Apr 11 12:02:45 <ldlework>	this highlights the whole buffer
Apr 11 12:03:13 <ldlework>	There's also (set-mark-command)
Apr 11 12:03:42 <mplsCorwin>	maybe check C-h v transient-mark-mode?
Apr 11 12:04:05 <ldlework>	you can pass t/nil to (activate-mark)
Apr 11 12:05:11 <mplsCorwin>	Without transient mark you might not be noticing that it's marking the buffer.  I think that flag just tells activate-mark not to change TMM?
Apr 11 12:05:30 <libertyprime>	ldlwork: https://asciinema.org/a/QxgJBqyBkifhh1orh8k3xqdUM fml
Apr 11 12:11:42 <mplsCorwin>	Hrm.  What'd I do? ...  Eager macro-expansion failure: (error "Loading file c:/Emacs-27.0.90/x86_64/share/emacs/27.0.90/lisp/subr.elc failed to provide feature ‘subr’") [2 times]

Apr 11 12:12:01 <mplsCorwin>	ug, sorry.  Should have ,,paste,, that afterall
Apr 11 12:12:02 <fsbot>	Please do not paste mutiple lines of text into the channel. Use a paste service like http://ix.io/, webpaste.el or dpaste.com instead.
Apr 11 12:12:56 <yourfate>	using tramp and dired, is there an easy method to open a file on the remote system with su rights? Ideally it would be just navigate to file in dired and then do something like `s` to open it with sudo?
Apr 11 12:13:17 <codingquark>	http://ix.io/2hA7 <- I seem to have messed my HDD, it has data and I would like to restore it. Please help.
Apr 11 12:13:26 <yourfate>	I don't want to have to specify the path to the file again etc
Apr 11 12:14:59 <wasamasa>	codingquark: there's this data recovery nut on ##security, goes by flyback / beanbag
Apr 11 12:15:25 <codingquark>	wasamasa: thanks, joining!
Apr 11 12:15:47 <wasamasa>	hope you've got plenty of time and space for that adventure :P
Apr 11 12:16:12 <wasamasa>	time because every time you do it right it takes ages, space because you better work with backups and a read-only image of the disk
Apr 11 12:17:00 <codingquark>	Hmm, I think this happened when I tried reading ext4 on win10
Apr 11 12:17:10 <codingquark>	Some weird software fucked up my partition table
Apr 11 12:17:35 <wasamasa>	if it's just that, you should be able to recreate it with photorec
Apr 11 12:17:57 <wasamasa>	but still, better safe than sorry :>
Apr 11 12:18:36 <codingquark>	True
Apr 11 12:18:45 <codingquark>	Has some single copy files of mine in there
Apr 11 12:19:11 <wasamasa>	in that case I'd make a copy of MBR/GPT stuff to be able to revert easily
Apr 11 12:20:24 <wasamasa>	anyway, I should go over my disks, some are exhibiting signs of fragmentation
Apr 11 12:21:26 <wasamasa>	I've fixed a read error with flyback's help before and made copious notes
Apr 11 12:21:53 <codingquark>	I'm playing with testdisk
Apr 11 12:22:20 <wasamasa>	testdisk/photorec are parts of the same bundle
Apr 11 12:22:29 <wasamasa>	so that's what I was referring to
Apr 11 12:22:59 <wasamasa>	they can detect existing filesystems on disk and recreate a matching partition table
Apr 11 12:24:14 <roadie>	does that work on apfs partitions?
Apr 11 12:24:53 <wasamasa>	doubtful
Apr 11 12:25:23 <wasamasa>	https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk#Filesystems
Apr 11 12:26:57 <roadie>	I will have to wait to retrieve my lost 2TB partition filled with important data 
Apr 11 12:28:33 <codingquark>	It seem to have detected my original partition as MS, but it actually was ext4
Apr 11 12:28:37 <codingquark>	Let me write that change
Apr 11 12:30:36 <codingquark>	Restored!
Apr 11 12:30:39 <codingquark>	Thanks dude

Apr 11 12:32:17 *	roadie does it
Apr 11 12:32:26 <andinus>	,discourage roadie
Apr 11 12:32:26 <fsbot>	roadie: you didn't put nearly enough effort into it. Pathetic.
Apr 11 12:32:39 <roadie>	,judges
Apr 11 12:32:40 <fsbot>	it was very close, but roadie won by a nose
Apr 11 12:33:16 *	codingquark finishes taking notes
Apr 11 12:33:48 *	roadie waves the pathetic prize ribbon around
Apr 11 12:34:17 *	codingquark looks around
Apr 11 12:36:12 <lxsameer>	hey folks, I need to execute a one time function on specific file type when users open any of those file, what's your recommended way of doing this ?
Apr 11 12:36:32 <andinus>	hook it?
Apr 11 12:36:35 <lxsameer>	my aim is to make sure it's a one time thing 
Apr 11 12:37:07 <andinus>	one time for every emacs daemon?
Apr 11 12:37:11 <mplsCorwin>	have your hook remove itself.  maybe check something before installing it too
Apr 11 12:37:18 <lxsameer>	andinus: one time per installaiton 
Apr 11 12:37:42 <andinus>	yeah then hook and ask your hook to dehook
Apr 11 12:38:01 <roadie>	so it shows one partition on that HD - but it knows there are 2 - 'child count: 2' but it says the capacity is that of the only one partition it lists ... how does it know there are 2 partitions?
Apr 11 12:38:02 <lxsameer>	thanks folks

Apr 11 12:49:58 <adgtl>	Any good soul want to review my Emacs config? https://github.com/anildigital/emacs/tree/use-package 
Apr 11 12:53:23 <ldlework>	not even in org-mode
Apr 11 12:53:26 <ldlework>	smh
Apr 11 12:55:26 <work_>	In Emacs when your init file have error and you restart, is there a way for Emacs to at least tell at what line the error is located?
Apr 11 12:55:35 <ldlework>	work_: --debug-init
Apr 11 13:23:46 <roadie>	would it not work to assign a var a different value every 10 lines and then you know whereabouts the error is by reading it out?
Apr 11 13:24:43 <wasamasa>	or you could just search for the relevant forms and zone in
Apr 11 13:24:53 <wasamasa>	no, emacs does not preserve line number information, at all
Apr 11 13:25:44 <ldlework>	oh line number, missed that
Apr 11 13:26:04 <wasamasa>	the best you'll get is figuring out what form it was reading in and the position of point after it
Apr 11 13:31:09 <libertyprime>	ldlework: found the problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069514/emacs-problems-with-activating-mark-in-an-interactive-command
Apr 11 13:31:25 <libertyprime>	basically, im a noob
Apr 11 13:33:26 <jamzattack>	Is there a way to run an idle timer only for a particular buffer? Currently checking the buffer in the function
Apr 11 13:33:45 <wasamasa>	that's the best you'll get
Apr 11 13:47:54 <giorgian>	Hi. Is there a way to get the file name from which a feature was loaded?
Apr 11 13:50:32 <ayuce>	hit `C-h f` and read the first line.
Apr 11 13:51:57 <giorgian>	Sorry, I mean non interactively, and often there isn't a function matching exatcly the feature name
Apr 11 13:52:31 <wasamasa>	`load-history'
Apr 11 13:53:20 <giorgian>	wasamasa: that's great, thank you
Apr 11 13:53:34 <wasamasa>	I can't recommend inspecting it with F1 v
Apr 11 13:54:55 <jamzattack>	yeah just got ~10 second hang...
Apr 11 13:55:31 <giorgian>	Yes, it got me worried for a few seconds
Apr 11 14:35:18 <codingquark>	wasamasa: shouldn't live stream have started by now?
Apr 11 14:36:18 <wasamasa>	there's a shader semifinals going on
Apr 11 14:37:07 <wasamasa>	my clock says 23 minutes left
Apr 11 14:43:46 <codingquark>	Your clock seems out of sync
Apr 11 14:44:13 <codingquark>	Hmm, perhaps you skipped opening

Apr 11 15:12:47 <codingquark>	wasamasa: is this a real person translating realtime?!
Apr 11 15:14:07 <wasamasa>	oh, I'm talking about revision, not divoc
Apr 11 15:14:20 <wasamasa>	but yeah, it's normal at CCC events for volunteers to provide live translation
Apr 11 15:14:26 <codingquark>	Amazing
Apr 11 15:15:04 <codingquark>	Let me checkout the part while they're talking about Germany's climate issues
Apr 11 15:18:29 <offby1>	parsnip: I can't go office-supply shopping now, you insensitive clod!!
Apr 11 15:20:56 <codingquark>	wasamasa: so in normal cases, people would gather and watch all these amazing stuff on a big screen?
Apr 11 15:21:00 <arussel>	https://orgmode.org/manual/Block-agenda.html#Block-agenda in this document aren't agenda and tags-todo function ? I can't find them with C-h f
Apr 11 15:21:18 <wasamasa>	codingquark: well, not me, but yes
Apr 11 15:24:52 <codingquark>	64k intro
Apr 11 15:26:02 <wasamasa>	most of these are from the revision 2019 playlist I've linked
Apr 11 15:27:15 <codingquark>	Oh
Apr 11 15:27:17 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 11 15:36:31 <wgreenhouse>	What is a good term for the phenomenon of a sleepy project suddenly getting a lot of commits now that the author is in lockdown?
Apr 11 15:38:03 <codingquark>	Hmm, it literally says demo for Revision 2019
Apr 11 15:39:50 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: I'd normally attribute that to spring cleaning
Apr 11 15:43:44 <codingquark>	But this has to do with lockdown
Apr 11 15:44:16 <wasamasa>	yeah, I know
Apr 11 15:45:26 <codingquark>	Lock it down!!!1!
Apr 11 15:46:06 <wasamasa>	this demoscene party from home has a great benefit, the parties themselves are not terribly engaging when there's no competition going on, so you can spend hours drinking, sleeping or coding up something on your rig, if you have any
Apr 11 15:46:21 <wasamasa>	but at home I can do whatever I want
Apr 11 15:46:39 <codingquark>	What else would you want to do?
Apr 11 15:46:50 <codingquark>	I'm being sarcastic
Apr 11 15:47:29 <wasamasa>	obtaining food is the most annoying thing
Apr 11 15:47:44 <wasamasa>	whereas cooking food at your own leisure is far nicer
Apr 11 15:53:08 <codingquark>	Oh yes
Apr 11 15:53:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ordering from delivery apps tends to minimize that annoyance.
Apr 11 15:53:23 <adgtl>	Any good soul want to review my Emacs config? https://github.com/anildigital/emacs/tree/use-package
Apr 11 15:53:32 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Of course now with the pandemic one can't trust that either. -_-
Apr 11 15:53:37 <codingquark>	Also I prefer drinking at home with close friends than drinking at parties with friends.
Apr 11 15:53:47 <wasamasa>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: you do that while you're on an event?
Apr 11 15:53:57 <codingquark>	Deliveries are closed here
Apr 11 15:54:05 <wasamasa>	ordering food during the pandemic is depressing
Apr 11 15:54:22 <wasamasa>	"Your order number is #7 and your pizza will be ready in 15 minutes."
Apr 11 15:54:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	wasamasa: Depends if the event has food. If not or it's thrice as expensive, yeah.
Apr 11 15:54:47 <codingquark>	If you want to go out far enough that you would need vehicle, allowed timings are 7am to 11am and 3pm to 5pm
Apr 11 15:55:06 <wasamasa>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: last Evoke had hot dogs and pretzels :D
Apr 11 15:55:09 <codingquark>	Ordering also means you're risking the other people
Apr 11 15:55:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: I wonder what they do regarding those without cars.
Apr 11 15:55:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: And really? You don't have contactless delivery?
Apr 11 15:55:43 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: nope. Basically don't got out on streets at all.
Apr 11 15:56:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm. How does one get groceries without a car?
Apr 11 15:56:14 <neeasade>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: weren't you just talking about delivery
Apr 11 15:56:24 <neeasade>	groceries can be delivered now as well :P
Apr 11 15:56:35 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: right, for that 7-11am, 3-5pm in car/bikes
Apr 11 15:56:48 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	neeasade: Well yes, I know that. I was just confused by the "don't go out on the streets at all"
Apr 11 15:56:55 <neeasade>	ah
Apr 11 15:58:07 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	But yes, contactless delivery is probably safer than drive-through.
Apr 11 15:58:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	At no point does the customer interact with the chain at all.
Apr 11 16:01:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Months without going out. Hikki life~
Apr 11 16:01:56 <adgtl>	Folks how to fix http://dpaste.com/0WAH8G1 Warning (bytecomp): reference to free variable ‘counsel-projectile-grep-action’ ?
Apr 11 16:01:56 <bremner>	good practice for when we all go to jail for running illegal software
Apr 11 16:02:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: Meh, just move to countries that don't respect foreign copyright.
Apr 11 16:02:57 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: By illegal software, I meant free software
Apr 11 16:03:08 <codingquark>	ho ho ho
Apr 11 16:03:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: I know.
Apr 11 16:03:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: But given the "recent" uptake of everything open-source (and often even Libre as well) in "Cloud" stuff, I think it's doubtful.
Apr 11 16:04:22 <bremner>	I was mostly joking, but talk to your central IT / admin types some time. It's a different world.
Apr 11 16:04:50 <bremner>	actually don't. it will just make you angry, but you get my point.
Apr 11 16:04:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I've actually worked in a lot of ops that are pretty much going full cloud.
Apr 11 16:05:07 <wasamasa>	I could never do these shader competitions
Apr 11 16:05:16 <wasamasa>	look at their braces not lining up
Apr 11 16:05:18 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: us too. Full Microsoft cloud
Apr 11 16:05:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Not for us, way too expensive.
Apr 11 16:06:06 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Outside of America Microsoft has a very weak offering, I find.
Apr 11 16:06:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	(As in, there's few reasons to go for them over Red Hat)
Apr 11 16:06:48 <codingquark>	wasamasa: totally ugly
Apr 11 16:06:54 <codingquark>	Much cringe
Apr 11 16:07:23 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I'm talking about office365 and related crap. RH doesn't really compete in that space afaik
Apr 11 16:07:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Google Does.
Apr 11 16:07:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Which admitedly isn't much better.
Apr 11 16:08:29 <roadie>	are you saying there are people in this channel using office, running windows and searching with google?
Apr 11 16:08:32 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I thought you meant the LDAP infra, which is why I brought up RH.
Apr 11 16:09:07 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	roadie: Probably. Sometimes business policies are annoying.
Apr 11 16:10:26 <roadie>	if its business, ok no biggie
Apr 11 16:11:04 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	At home there's use for a separate machine with a GPU & Windows (consider the machine pwn'd) for those few games that don't work well on Wine/Proton.
Apr 11 16:11:44 <roadie>	I have my win7 box for the cryengine2 sandbox - totally resepected. of course it is offline.
Apr 11 16:11:53 <roadie>	respected even
Apr 11 16:12:00 <offby1>	re-specc'd?
Apr 11 16:12:12 <offby1>	are ee ess pea ee sea pea
Apr 11 16:12:13 <roadie>	Hut ab, Respekt!
Apr 11 16:12:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I have a separate gaming machine dual-booting Windows & Linux. Because I figure that the games being proprietary themselves, and how anti-cheats work, means it's pretty much malware-ridden even if I only use purchased games on it.
Apr 11 16:13:37 <roadie>	makes sense
Apr 11 16:14:29 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	The unfortunate thing is that while I can do that, I'm very aware some people can't afford to.
Apr 11 16:15:22 <roadie>	my favorite OS's were: DOS, Windows95SE, Blag GNU/Linux and now macos. All of them are great!
Apr 11 16:15:38 <roadie>	oh, 98SE ... Typo
Apr 11 16:16:00 <roadie>	Debian rules of course
Apr 11 16:16:11 <ldlework>	nixos bestos
Apr 11 16:16:33 <roadie>	,laugh
Apr 11 16:16:35 <fsbot>	BAAAAHAHAHAHAH HaHAHAA HA HA HHHHA AH *snort* HA HHA HAHAHA HA HAH HAH HAH HAHAH HAH HAH oh man HAH AH HAAAAAHAAAHHH *cough* *cough* *cough* hah hehhh hehhhhh geez.. *cough*
Apr 11 16:16:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	OSX is generally more comfortable than Windows.
Apr 11 16:17:48 <roadie>	I had to get OSX when I saw the transparent terminal windows piling up in the girl with the dragon tattoo
Apr 11 16:18:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	For home stuff, I find that Debian & Arch/Manjaro are decent daily-drivers. Guix System will one day be, but for now it's mostly messing around in a dev VM 
Apr 11 16:19:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	roadie: Can't you do that fairly easily with openbox & terminator?
Apr 11 16:21:23 <roadie>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I would not know - I ran blackbox once but that's it
Apr 11 16:21:31 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah I see.
Apr 11 16:22:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I just checked, one can also just install compton & urxvt, adjust composition (compton) transparency settings and it works.
Apr 11 16:22:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Btw, if you experience screen tearing on videos, it's worth checking if you have a compositor installed in the first place, and then if it's a good one.
Apr 11 16:25:00 <soda__hobart>	hi everybody, what is a good way to change tab width within just the current buffer?  I have an XSD file I am looking at, and the tab width is 8, but I would like it to be 2 or 4.
Apr 11 16:27:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html Might this work?
Apr 11 16:33:08 <soda__hobart>	cool, yeah thanks, that worked.  come to think of it, I don't think I even needed the make-local-varaible func, because (setq tab-width) is for the local buffer anyways, it's (setq-default) to make it a default?
Apr 11 16:47:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	setq operates at another level that'd set it globally, iirc
Apr 11 16:48:17 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, setq-local is a thing though.
Apr 11 17:14:19 <codingquark>	ANSI art is cool
Apr 11 17:15:00 <codingquark>	Well, that was out of context for most
Apr 11 17:25:09 <wasamasa>	I remember creating big ascii art letters in notepad, then discovering many years later these can be generated by tools
Apr 11 17:25:55 <bremner>	that's a bit unkind as a characterization of ascii-artists
Apr 11 17:26:05 <technomancy>	lol
Apr 11 17:30:48 <wasamasa>	sure, but for random open source projects I have my doubts they wouldn't use figlet
Apr 11 17:31:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I consider it unlikely any simple lettering output on projects was done otherwise than by tools.
Apr 11 17:31:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Now for crack nfo files, that's a different story
Apr 11 17:32:15 <wasamasa>	true, these are the real deal
Apr 11 17:32:25 <wasamasa>	I don't get the rivalry between amiga and ansi style though
Apr 11 17:32:46 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I don't know enough of the topic to know of that rivalry.
Apr 11 17:32:59 <wasamasa>	then there's petscii
Apr 11 17:33:34 <wasamasa>	well, there's people who love extended ascii with block drawing characters and colors
Apr 11 17:33:47 <wasamasa>	and then there's people who love drawing things with slopes into some weird form of graffiti
Apr 11 17:33:48 <codingquark>	there are subcultures of a subculture, not surprising
Apr 11 17:33:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I've sometime wondered if they tend to make the art in ascii-first or if they make it in some bitmap drawing program first and then convert it.
Apr 11 17:34:38 <wasamasa>	petscii is something even more elusive with charsets used on the C64
Apr 11 17:34:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It just seems like making it in text first would, especially with block drawing chars, require an absurdly accurate and broad knowledge of the charset.
Apr 11 17:35:33 <wasamasa>	there's this shop selling amiga-style t-shirts: https://shop.harikazen.com/
Apr 11 17:36:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	heh, nice
Apr 11 17:36:54 <wasamasa>	though, I kind of doubt the `sl` train counts :D
Apr 11 17:38:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh, ascii tattoos are a thing. Neat.
Apr 11 18:55:37 <wgreenhouse>	huh, now I've seen it: a large complex package whose official build system is guix
Apr 11 18:55:41 <wgreenhouse>	proper dogfooding
Apr 11 18:55:46 <wgreenhouse>	https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/build-scripts/guix.scm
Apr 11 19:00:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh, neat.
Apr 11 19:01:32 <wgreenhouse>	also neat in general. a webkit/qtwebengine browser largely written in common lisp, and designed to be hacked from SLIME
Apr 11 19:04:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	One day I'll stop being lazy and see about adding umatrix-like functionality to it.
Apr 11 19:07:13 <bremner>	I wonder how much of a nightmare it would be to package for debian
Apr 11 19:07:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I mean, you're packaging for debian. :p
Apr 11 19:07:45 <bremner>	right. But, as whois attests, I'm used to that part
Apr 11 19:08:57 <bremner>	upstream provides packages, which might or might not be a good sign
Apr 11 19:48:41 <sveit>	dale: sorry, i got disconnected yesterday, are you still around?
Apr 11 19:59:58 <parsnip>	offby1: dangit, i was trying to rick roll, you insensitive clod
Apr 11 20:04:56 <parsnip>	rudybot: do you believe in the horrendous space kablooie?
Apr 11 20:05:14 <rudybot>	parsnip: "big bang" is much shorter than "the horrendous space kablooie" or even "HSK" (when said out loud)
Apr 11 20:05:45 <parsnip>	rudybot: you know what happens if you say it out loud, though
Apr 11 20:05:57 <rudybot>	parsnip: oh yeah? YOu want to get into a big loud flamewar that is boring but happens to drown out the git discussion?
Apr 11 20:06:32 <giorgian>	Hi. How can I prevent files compiled by package to show up in recentf?
Apr 11 20:08:23 <parsnip>	giorgian: i went to source file of recentf and searched for "regex", and found some leads
Apr 11 20:08:45 <giorgian>	parsnip: thank you
Apr 11 20:08:58 <parsnip>	maybe a better way to do that is M-x customize-group RET recentf RET
Apr 11 20:09:34 <parsnip>	my next research would be info-apropos recentf, but i hate cuz it's slow
Apr 11 20:11:17 <parsnip>	emacs info manual does mention recentf-edit-list, if you need to clean up an existing list, i guess
Apr 11 20:11:33 <parsnip>	(i just C-s search emacs's info manual
Apr 11 20:11:35 <parsnip>	)
Apr 11 20:12:04 <giorgian>	yes, I found recentf-edit-list, but I don't want to do that every time I install or upgrade a package...
Apr 11 20:24:59 <markasoftware>	What's the logic behind c-mode implementing their own electric indentation instead of relying on electric-indent-mode?
Apr 11 20:25:11 <bremner>	lol, logic
Apr 11 20:25:18 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Grandfathered in?
Apr 11 20:25:31 <markasoftware>	ok lol
Apr 11 20:25:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I wasn't stating so, just guessing it might predate it.
Apr 11 20:26:06 <markasoftware>	i'm thinking of disabling the special c-electric-flag and just turning on electric-indent-mode, was wondering why it's not like that by default
Apr 11 20:30:47 <giorgian>	wow, it only took me two attempts to edit the regex correctly!
Apr 11 20:31:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	gratz
Apr 11 20:44:22 <johnjay>	>logic
Apr 11 20:44:26 <johnjay>	>emacs
Apr 11 20:44:26 <johnjay>	wat
Apr 11 20:44:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I mean, pretty much any legacy codebase will have this kind of stuff where completely redundant code is kept because refactoring isn't a thing.
Apr 11 21:33:04 <jfb4>	emacs tty seems to have a lot of advantages over emacs gui.  Even things like certain key combinations being impossible actually helps your rsi.
Apr 11 21:33:05 <jfb4>	  
Apr 11 21:34:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I find that good posture and actually using the duplicates of keys on your keyboard (like meta & shift) helps.
Apr 11 21:34:31 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: emacs on tty is more limited (and limiting) than emacs on a 1970s lisp machine. But it's better than no Emacs
Apr 11 21:34:48 <Sketch>	that's the first time i've ever heard lack of features described as a positive ;)
Apr 11 21:34:48 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: that's fascinating - why?
Apr 11 21:35:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It doesn't mix well with tmux, which makes multi-frame usage annoying, for one.
Apr 11 21:35:14 <Sketch>	no space cadet keyboard on a tty?
Apr 11 21:35:16 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: do you mean the MIT Lisp machine that rms was involved with or the symbolics one
Apr 11 21:35:33 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: symbolics
Apr 11 21:35:36 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: zmacs on the Symbolics had vector graphics, good mouse support, and great modifier keys
Apr 11 21:36:00 <wgreenhouse>	tty emacs rather pathetic by comparison 
Apr 11 21:36:21 <jfb4>	yes I wish you could find a modern Space cadet keyb. There was a Hall Effect keyboard maker but that went out of stock.
Apr 11 21:36:23 <ldlework>	vector graphics in emacs would be so awesome
Apr 11 21:36:47 <wgreenhouse>	ldlework: well you can generate svg on the fly at least
Apr 11 21:36:48 <Sketch>	isn't there svg support?
Apr 11 21:36:54 <Sketch>	(on graphical emacs)
Apr 11 21:37:02 <ldlework>	Yeah but imagine doing in-buffer ui 
Apr 11 21:37:07 <ekleog>	what do people use nowadays to have a shell inside emacs? I can see shell, eshell and term, and these are only the built-in ones… can't even imagine how many shells there are in the environment ^^'
Apr 11 21:37:15 <ldlework>	like an outline around a text input or something
Apr 11 21:37:17 <ldlework>	just simple stuff
Apr 11 21:37:19 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: emacs tty seems so much more stable (in conjunction with GNU screen) over the network 
Apr 11 21:37:26 <wgreenhouse>	Sketch: yes, see e.g. ,,slime-volleyball,, for a goofy PoC
Apr 11 21:37:27 <fsbot>	slime-volleyball -- [0] <https://github.com/fitzsim/slime-volleyball>, an elisp clone of the classic Slime Volleyball game
Apr 11 21:37:27 <fsbot>	[1] upping the ante from svg-clock as a demonstration of Emacs SVG rendering for animation
Apr 11 21:37:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	term & ansi-term are okay
Apr 11 21:38:14 <ldlework>	had a conversation in another channel today about how it is surprising there is no termbox/urwid -like package for emacs
Apr 11 21:38:24 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: that's true. lispm model would be to have a beefy local workstation and a fileserver behind it
Apr 11 21:38:32 <ldlework>	like, yeah, those kind of libraries are annoying to write as it's super finicky and it's a bunch of work
Apr 11 21:38:36 <wgreenhouse>	lispm was fundamentally a single user platform
Apr 11 21:38:37 <ldlework>	but emacs been out for a while :)
Apr 11 21:39:06 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: ok, thanks :) I'll have a look at it!
Apr 11 21:39:52 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: why do you think rms seems to prefer the console (according to emacs-devel)
Apr 11 21:40:14 <ldlework>	jfb4: do you know how incredibly useful image tooltips are in org-mode documents?
Apr 11 21:40:24 <aidalgol>	fsbot: lispm?
Apr 11 21:40:25 <fsbot>	try:  AutoLispMode ElispMailSigs ElispManual EmacsLispManual GoLispMode ILispMode InferiorEmacsLispMode LispMachine LispMachines LispMeralda LispmeraldaArchive MitCadrLispm
Apr 11 21:40:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	jfb4: Probably because the machines he uses aren't exactly what one could call beefy.
Apr 11 21:40:55 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	When you're stuck <2G of RAM, you'll avoid the overhead of a graphic server as long as you can.
Apr 11 21:41:10 <jfb4>	ldlework: thanks but I don't currently use org mode, but good to know.
Apr 11 21:41:24 <ldlework>	jfb4: killer app
Apr 11 21:41:32 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: he also uses rmail
Apr 11 21:41:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I found mu4e to be nicer personally.
Apr 11 21:41:49 <wgreenhouse>	His .emacs would be as much ,,hell,, to me as yours: )
Apr 11 21:41:50 <jfb4>	I used to have lots of GUI nistance but over time I find having GNU Screen with several emacs (for some apps) works well
Apr 11 21:41:50 <fsbot>	hell is other people's .emacs
Apr 11 21:42:09 <jfb4>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: yes mu4e is what I use also.
Apr 11 21:42:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It's fast, but mostly it has a very nice user interaction ing eneral.
Apr 11 21:42:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	But the fact it doesn't block all my other frames is definitely good.
Apr 11 21:42:51 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: is there, like, an easy way to kill the term buffer apart from C-x k <enter>? I'll probably just define one myself if not, but it feels like something that should already be there, so one could just pop-up a shell and close it just as easily
Apr 11 21:43:02 <ryouma>	there is a new one coming out, i think it is a c module or something --- 13:37 <ekleog> what do people use nowadays to have a shell inside emacs? I can see shell, eshell and term, and these are only the built-in ones… can't even imagine how many shells there are in the environment ^^'
Apr 11 21:43:07 <ryouma>	,termbox
Apr 11 21:43:08 <fsbot>	Th' MIND is the Pizza Palace of th' SOUL
Apr 11 21:43:23 <wasamasa>	how do these demo people manage to always put the horse shit first in compos and ramp up to the good things
Apr 11 21:43:37 <wasamasa>	the first pc 4k entry shows bible verses
Apr 11 21:44:12 <ryouma>	ekleog: i use shell beacuse glitches in term and term does not have obvious keybindings for everything i wnat to do.  it has issues though.  eshell is for those who do not have sunk costs in bash.  term is for htop.
Apr 11 21:44:17 <ekleog>	ryouma: hmm… got any references? `emacs termbox` doesn't look like it raises anything on google
Apr 11 21:44:31 <ryouma>	i was not claiming termbox was the name of the new one
Apr 11 21:44:39 <ekleog>	ooh thought so :)
Apr 11 21:44:49 <ryouma>	somebody here will know
Apr 11 21:45:02 <ekleog>	hmm so shell and term I guess, I have way too much sunk cost in zsh :°
Apr 11 21:45:34 <wgreenhouse>	,vte
Apr 11 21:45:36 <fsbot>	I think vterm is [0] https://github.com/vterm/vterm
Apr 11 21:45:37 <fsbot>	[1] https://github.com/emacsmirror/vterm
Apr 11 21:45:50 <wgreenhouse>	I think that's the new one
Apr 11 21:45:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I'm not aware of one, but that is mainly because I haven't looked for one. Old buffers get recycled by clean-buffer-list sometimes. Generally after a few hundred async commands are lying around with no-process, I open c-x c-b, create a macro searching for "no proc", mark d, and run it a few hundred times.
Apr 11 21:46:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I check that it didn't mark anything not intended to be deleted, and confirm with x.
Apr 11 21:46:36 <holomorph>	wgreenhouse: emoji commit messages, so futuristic
Apr 11 21:46:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	␣☣️
Apr 11 21:46:51 <ekleog>	wgreenhouse: thank you!
Apr 11 21:47:04 <ryouma>	shell is based on comint.  comint was supposed to unify all the smiilar things.  it has glitches or obscurities.  or shell does.  idk.  but it is better than non-emacs.
Apr 11 21:49:20 <ekleog>	hmmmmmmm soooo that makes shell, eshell, term, ansi-term and vterm
Apr 11 21:49:44 <wgreenhouse>	ekleog: and compilation-mode (also comint derived)
Apr 11 21:50:24 <ekleog>	hmmmm
Apr 11 21:50:44 <ekleog>	wonder how much I could twist compilation-mode to compile over ssh (I've got some code I can only compile on a remote machine)
Apr 11 21:50:49 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: What's lispm?
Apr 11 21:51:24 <ekleog>	like, usually my process was git add, git push, then on an open shell on theremote git fetch, git reset --hard, build; but if compilation-mode were able to handle that it'd be awesome
Apr 11 21:51:25 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Could always connect via TRAMP+ssh over it and open a shell or term on it.
Apr 11 21:51:49 <ryouma>	i am confused.  compilation-mode is comint?  even shell compilation minor mode is just a think that lets you ret i think.
Apr 11 21:51:54 <ryouma>	thing
Apr 11 21:51:58 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Somewhat more fond of putting things in tmux sessions because it means if I manage to crash emacs or xorg, I don't lose anything.
Apr 11 21:52:32 <wgreenhouse>	aidalgol: a lisp machine for short
Apr 11 21:52:41 <aidalgol>	ah
Apr 11 21:52:46 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: or it is if you C-u M-x compile
Apr 11 21:52:49 <ryouma>	so you run x via tmux?  like, tmux startx or somethign?
Apr 11 21:53:07 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: thank you!
Apr 11 21:53:19 <wgreenhouse>	ekleog: compilation-mode is tramp-aware
Apr 11 21:53:26 <ekleog>	guess I now have asked enough questions to have package documentation to read for the day, so it'll be fun :)
Apr 11 21:53:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I rather more recommend something like: ssh user@server -t tmux attach
Apr 11 21:53:36 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Or just "tmux" if no session already exists.
Apr 11 21:53:45 <ryouma>	i never use compile.  also compilation shell minor mode is too slow.  but i would use it.
Apr 11 21:53:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Otherwise connection loss can fuark your things up.
Apr 11 21:54:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: I run background tmux sessions, detach and reattach periodically to check for completion or launch new jobs.
Apr 11 21:54:17 <ekleog>	wgreenhouse: hmm I need to understand what tramp is actually about before that, like, it looks like that's remote-edit plus some… thousands of things? here I'd be hoping for local-edit, and compile by push+compile (because what Aurora_iz_kosmos is saying)
Apr 11 21:54:53 <ekleog>	(don't have stuff that takes hours to compile, though, so it's not that bad if connection drops, so long as I'm not editing over it)
Apr 11 21:55:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: So, if you're looking at your code on the remote machine and can launch a shell on it, then you could also directly use compilation in a buffer opened from that TRAMP session
Apr 11 21:55:26 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Mind, tmux is more advisable if cannot guarantee 100% connectivity during the build.
Apr 11 21:55:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: Those sessions survive xorg crashing as tmux daemonizes itself.

Apr 11 22:12:24 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: If all you want to do is file management you can use /scp:blah@bleh:/ and it'll work fine.
Apr 11 22:12:51 <ekleog>	oh cool :)
Apr 11 22:13:24 <ekleog>	so now, the last issue I guess (apart from how to actually get a shell) is tramp never prompts me for the 2FA code I need to enter to start an ssh connection, meaning that I have to manually start an ssh session in another shell before running tramp just to enter the 2FA code
Apr 11 22:13:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	? eh? Running a command from scp worked for me just now? That's new...
Apr 11 22:14:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I guess you may disregard ssh-tunneling mode entirely then, just use scp.

Apr 11 22:21:01 <ekleog>	yeah, I've looked at tramp-shell-prompt-pattern, but theoretically it should first try shell-prompt-pattern, and I've tried adding  in this one without success
Apr 11 22:21:04 <parsnip>	hmm, maybe i should explicitly select "Teen Girl Bedrooms"

Apr 11 22:21:34 *	bpalmer looks at the channel
Apr 11 22:21:59 <ryouma>	idk what pinterest is, but 1) it is named pinterest.  it is not surprising that it asks for interests.  2) it is probably social.  it is not supruising that it asks for social information.  (this makes me sound like i am defending it.)
Apr 11 22:22:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It's a social network which sometimes happen to be the only remaining host for copies of certain images from artist that decided to censor their whole galleries as cashgrabbing measures
Apr 11 22:23:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	DMCA'ing your stuff is demonstrating you're not worth helping.
Apr 11 22:23:19 <parsnip>	oh, i can select all. that's similar enough to none for me.
Apr 11 22:23:24 <ryouma>	i think there is an onion site thingie for archiving random sites.  cannot be taken down.
Apr 11 22:23:26 <ekleog>	yup, just tried adding  alongside > in tramp-shell-prompt-pattern, looks like it fails too
Apr 11 22:23:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: That is relevant to my interests.
Apr 11 22:23:43 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: trying to appropriate some one else's art is a terrible practice.
Apr 11 22:24:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I meant more hosting it on repositories like gelbooru (with credits & appropriate tags), and then having it removed because "lol they complained"
Apr 11 22:24:20 <bpalmer>	ekleog: not sure what that other character is; perhaps it is an encoding issue?
Apr 11 22:24:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Generally having the artist visible in tag categories is seen as helpful and desirable by users of such repositories.
Apr 11 22:24:48 <ryouma>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: quite useful for proving that bad guys did bad things
Apr 11 22:25:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Appropriating art would be more removing any credits and claiming you made it. Which is entirely distint from my use-case.
Apr 11 22:25:26 <ekleog>	bpalmer: it's the powerline marker, clearly utf-8, so encoding issues sound likely but I can't find a way to investigate that more, and it displays just the same way when I run ssh in eshell and when I'm on tramp-shell-prompt-pattern's customize buffer
Apr 11 22:25:30 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: the artist complains? Then the people posting it are violating the license and appropriating the artist's work
Apr 11 22:25:39 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: just like taking GPL code and using it against that license.
Apr 11 22:25:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I think we have a different definition of appropriation.
Apr 11 22:25:58 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I define as taking the credit for something you didn't make.
Apr 11 22:26:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	You put it online, it's online. QED
Apr 11 22:26:36 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: cool. Glad to know you don't believe in FLOSS
Apr 11 22:26:48 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I rather consider that the opposite.
Apr 11 22:27:02 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: sorry, someone puts the code online, it's online. QED.
Apr 11 22:27:24 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Aye. Which implies that respect of copyright and patents is also unnecessary, as well as licenses.
Apr 11 22:27:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Other than being a tad bit anarchistic, it doesn't seem very freedom-restricting to me.
Apr 11 22:28:09 <ekleog>	“tad bit” :D (this is neither an endorsement nor a criticism)
Apr 11 22:28:14 <bpalmer>	And copyleft licenses explicitly require licenses to be respected.
Apr 11 22:28:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I care more about public domain/free accessible than copyleft strictly.
Apr 11 22:29:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	*freely accessible
Apr 11 22:29:08 <jennie>	hello any chemist here
Apr 11 22:29:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Copyleft is a mechanism required because of the oxymoron of IP.
Apr 11 22:29:43 <parsnip>	jennie: i make coffee, does that make me a chemist? i also took an introduction to chemistry class.
Apr 11 22:29:44 <bpalmer>	at any rate. I don't care enough at this time to get into an argument about morals, but people who think artists should never be able to stop rampant piracy of their work strike me as immoral.
Apr 11 22:30:00 <jennie>	lol
Apr 11 22:30:12 <parsnip>	don't drink bleach
Apr 11 22:30:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	And I consider hiding cultural references to be akin to censorship and just as ethically distasteful.
Apr 11 22:30:33 <parsnip>	don't mix ammonia and bleach, it can kill you
Apr 11 22:30:47 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Or at least, wear eye protection and an organic-vapor filter first.
Apr 11 22:30:48 <parsnip>	the mechanism of soap is really cool
Apr 11 22:30:57 <jennie>	i need some help looking to understand an equation
Apr 11 22:31:20 <bandali>	yeah bleach + ammonia produces chlorine gas iirc, or some other chlorine-related gas
Apr 11 22:31:36 <parsnip>	2 * H + O = H_2 O
Apr 11 22:33:32 <bpalmer>	jennie: you can ask your question and people may be able to help, but something like chemistry stack exchange may have more direct and experienced answers
Apr 11 22:34:36 <hodapp>	jennie: what level of chemistry? is this, like, grad level, or closer to high school or undergrad 101 level?
Apr 11 22:34:57 <jennie>	beginner level 
Apr 11 22:35:04 <jennie>	maybe highschool
Apr 11 22:35:13 <hodapp>	jennie: go ahead and ask. if I'm out of my depth, I'll try to tell you
Apr 11 22:35:31 <jennie>	Zn + Na2CO3 + 2H2O = 2NaOH + ZnCO3 + H2
Apr 11 22:35:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	My stance on IP can generally be summarized as: Abolitionism. Attribution/credits is simply kudos & good manners. But that's all.
Apr 11 22:36:12 <jennie>	the equation balancer tells that i will get ZnCO3 but wiki is saying that i will get ZincHydroxide, 
Apr 11 22:36:17 <jennie>	"Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide. "
Apr 11 22:36:36 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Also I'm mildly amused by the possibility of this being homework related.
Apr 11 22:36:50 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah it is.
Apr 11 22:36:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh
Apr 11 22:36:58 <hodapp>	I sort of don't care that it is
Apr 11 22:37:19 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	hodapp: Oh me neither, I'm just amused that #emacs was the resource someone chose to reach out to.
Apr 11 22:37:36 <jennie>	its not homework
Apr 11 22:37:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, my bad.
Apr 11 22:39:20 <hodapp>	jennie: I'm seeing that also ZnCO3 -> ZnO + CO2 in the presence of 200-300 C heat
Apr 11 22:39:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	jennie: So, I may not remember 100%, but it may have multiple possible outputs.
Apr 11 22:40:36 <jennie>	ok, hodapp i ran that setup in a small water glass at home, i put sodium bicarbonate in distilled water and put 99% zinc rods in the solution and ran it, now i see lots of powder settled down at the bottom of glass, what is it?
Apr 11 22:40:40 <jennie>	is it ZnCO3
Apr 11 22:41:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	This whole thing is making me remember I should really read those chemistry textbooks I have in my archives.
Apr 11 22:51:16 <hodapp>	jennie: hmmm I suppose it could be but I am not sure how to verify that
Apr 11 22:51:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Perhaps it has a distinctive color when set on fire?
Apr 11 22:52:38 <jennie>	yes, i am wondering that too, lets assume that it is zinc carbonate, then why wiki is saying that electrolysis is making zinc hydroxide :?
Apr 11 22:54:12 <hodapp>	hmm, I'm seeing that zinc hydroxide is also a white powder
Apr 11 22:59:54 <jennie>	yes, i am just scratching my head for a while
Apr 11 23:00:54 <hodapp>	don't do too much of that, or the white powder will just be dandruff
Apr 11 23:02:01 <parsnip>	maybe dry it and weigh it?
Apr 11 23:04:59 <jennie>	i guess, i will re-do the experiment, with NaCl electrolyte this time, because i've just found this equation, what do you think?
Apr 11 23:04:59 <jennie>	 H2O + 2NaCl + Zn = ZnO + 2NaH + 2Cl

Apr 11 23:34:20 <technomancy>	geiser is very pro-interactive-development and racket is very much not, so I imagine it has to pull off some impressive hacks =)
Apr 11 23:39:42 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Is that so? I found that Racket is basically impossible to write without either interactive deployment or reading all the contract docs.
Apr 11 23:40:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Which I suppose they might be expecting us to do the latter...
Apr 11 23:40:09 <technomancy>	they have a saying "the top level is hopeless" which I find terribly depressing
Apr 11 23:40:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Eh?
Apr 11 23:40:21 <technomancy>	I think the assumption is that you restart your entire program for every reload
Apr 11 23:40:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	the top level is hopeless?
Apr 11 23:40:41 <technomancy>	that's what they call the repl
Apr 11 23:41:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Well. That's rather unlispy.
Apr 11 23:42:03 <technomancy>	it's definitely my least favorite aspect of racket
Apr 11 23:43:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	The genereal availability of REPLs has made it so most Scheme tooling sorta requires one.
Apr 11 23:43:41 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hence some of the hacks I'm reading.
Apr 11 23:44:06 <ecbrown>	you should try the scheme in gimp
Apr 11 23:44:41 <technomancy>	I agree, however the general way that programming works makes it so doing any programming in any language without a repl is unbearably tedious so...
Apr 11 23:45:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm, I'm not to the point where I find it unbearable, but it is definitely a noticeable friction/hindrance during development.
Apr 11 23:46:09 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ecbrown: What version do they run?
Apr 11 23:46:41 <parsnip>	inb4 everyone is using zsh
Apr 11 23:47:17 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Hm?
Apr 11 23:47:39 <parsnip>	well... it's now default on macos
Apr 11 23:47:49 <ecbrown>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: not sure it has a version, just a scheme for an extension language.  it's remarkably productive though
Apr 11 23:47:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Ah, yes.
Apr 11 23:48:16 <parsnip>	i guess that doesn't mean bash isn't default on lignux

Apr 12 07:38:30 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: jordi@Iris:/temptrials/quarantine/bin$ ls
Apr 12 07:46:22 <arussel>	doing some orgmode programming, I can get a paragraph that will looks like: '(paragraph (:begin 20 :end 41 :contents-begin 20 :contents-end 40 :post-blank 1 :post-affiliated 20 ...) #("this is the content" 0 20 (:parent #0)))'
Apr 12 07:46:46 <arussel>	I see how to get the value begin, end, contents-begin ... but how do I get the value fo the text ?
Apr 12 07:47:42 <roadie>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=LgK5ZqjvC5s
Apr 12 07:47:49 <arussel>	bonus questions, is it a structure as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Structures.html ? is there a C-h XXX keybing to have description on how this is done ?
Apr 12 07:48:36 <dale>	arussel: It looks like a list to me.  I'm guessing you're using the org-element API?
Apr 12 07:48:50 <arussel>	yes I  am
Apr 12 07:48:57 <wasamasa>	that is text, just with text properties
Apr 12 07:49:22 <dale>	arussel: What wasamasa said, looks like the last element in that list is probably the content.  It's just propertized text, but it can be treated like a string.
Apr 12 07:49:29 <arussel>	so I can get org-element-propert :xxx, but I can't find the api for get me the text
Apr 12 07:49:29 <dale>	arussel: And no, I don't believe it is a cl-lib struct.
Apr 12 07:49:50 <arussel>	what does the #() means ?
Apr 12 07:49:58 <wasamasa>	propertized text
Apr 12 07:50:19 <dale>	arussel: Not org-element-contents?
Apr 12 07:50:51 <arussel>	this returns the list of element, so running it on para gives the exact same result
Apr 12 07:51:20 <arussel>	(nth 2 para) gives me the propertized text
Apr 12 07:51:24 <wasamasa>	it doesn't have anything to do with structures
Apr 12 07:51:34 <dale>	Hm, no, apparently not org-element-contents.
Apr 12 07:52:13 <wasamasa>	it should do it though
Apr 12 07:53:00 <wasamasa>	a list of the text and that parent
Apr 12 07:53:10 <dale>	OTOH my (org-element-at-point) doesn't return the paragraph string like arussel's did.
Apr 12 07:53:14 <wasamasa>	hence why contents is pluralized
Apr 12 07:53:31 <dale>	org-element-contents is just (nthcdr 2 element), so it should probably work.
Apr 12 07:54:11 <arussel>	and how do I get the text out of a propertized text ?
Apr 12 07:54:17 <wasamasa>	it is text
Apr 12 07:54:32 <wasamasa>	the only difference is that its printed representation scares the bejeesus out of newbies
Apr 12 07:54:49 <wasamasa>	and if you insert it, it may look funny
Apr 12 07:54:54 <wasamasa>	thanks to properties
Apr 12 07:55:29 <arussel>	it does, thanks all for your help :-)
Apr 12 07:55:44 <wasamasa>	if you for some reason want to get rid of its text properties, that can be done, too
Apr 12 07:56:04 <arussel>	no, I'm good with it
Apr 12 07:56:15 <wasamasa>	it's just that you often don't care and pass it around to whatever other function
Apr 12 07:56:38 <arussel>	and it is probably trivial to google it. The issue with orgmode is trying to google api stuff returns very little info.
Apr 12 07:56:52 <wasamasa>	trying to google elisp stuff is a bad idea in general
Apr 12 07:57:03 <dale>	arussel: I assume you've already found https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html?
Apr 12 07:57:05 <wasamasa>	use the built-in documentation, consult the source code when needed

Apr 12 11:38:39 <bremner>	anyway, not sure why we hate el salvador. They seem perfectly nice, at least the el salvadoreans I met.
Apr 12 11:39:19 <bpalmer>	there are no pupusas near me.
Apr 12 11:39:27 <bpalmer>	is there a better reason to hate?
Apr 12 11:41:03 <bpalmer>	the el salvadoreans ... is that like the hoi polloi, something to be avoided?
Apr 12 11:54:05 <roadie>	a little hate is always good when war is a force that gives us meaning
Apr 12 12:08:30 <giorgian>	What was again the name of the variable containing all loaded files and the symbols defined within?

Apr 12 12:13:10 <aidalgol>	sorry, been stuck in isolation with goats too long.
Apr 12 12:13:11 <rudybot>	bremner: I'm taking an intro to philosophy class this semester and so far the kids in there have been up to the point of almost depression, giving the rationale for why they believe in spirits another such thing. I don't care if you believe in God just give me a reason besides I don't know or my religious doctrine says it's true...
Apr 12 12:13:12 <DuClare>	braying makes you right
Apr 12 12:15:40 <roadie>	where does this 'uniquefoldername'>'index.html' structure come from? is that a database or PHP collateral or was it always meant to be like that... (thousands of index.html in their respective folders)
Apr 12 12:17:01 <codingquark>	Turning North can make you right
Apr 12 12:17:28 <bremner>	being xenophobic makes you right (wing)

Apr 12 12:18:27 <codingquark>	See I screamed as well a little
Apr 12 12:20:28 <aidalgol>	roadie: HTTP servers have had a default behaviour of serving index.html when the request URL ends in 'uniquefoldername'
Apr 12 12:21:54 <aidalgol>	I have no idea what you're looking at that has thousands of folders with HTML files in them.
Apr 12 12:22:06 <aidalgol>	I'm going to guess some kind of generated report?
Apr 12 12:23:32 <aidalgol>	bpalmer: I find it all rather bemusing because a_ the public sleep-walked right into this mess, b) Silicon Valley is not the entire software/technology industry, and c) many of the problems are not unique to this industry.
Apr 12 12:23:43 <aidalgol>	Maybe I should write a Medium.com thinkpiece.

Apr 12 12:28:20 <fsbot>	I'm telling you, you don't want to know.
Apr 12 13:07:16 <bremner>	ugh. Do I really have customize dired-listing-switches to get "human friendly" units in dired?
Apr 12 13:09:04 <codingquark>	I never got used to it, so I disable all those punk columns
Apr 12 13:13:54 <broquaint>	I've somehow managed to enable a mode (I guess?) whereby entering & followed by some combination of characters produces a multi-byte character (e.g &ff produces ﬀ), does anyone know what that is and how I can learn more about?
Apr 12 13:16:00 <wgreenhouse>	broquaint: that sounds like the TeX input method 
Apr 12 13:16:48 <wgreenhouse>	which is not actually for writing TeX, but lets you write various characters by entering their TeX symbol
Apr 12 13:17:21 <wgreenhouse>	,,df describe-input-method,, can tell you more
Apr 12 13:17:21 <fsbot>	describe-input-method is an interactive compiled Lisp function in

Apr 12 13:19:02 <wgreenhouse>	Ah hmm
Apr 12 13:19:08 <broquaint>	Not sure how I enabled that ... but at least I can do something about it.
Apr 12 13:19:24 <wgreenhouse>	Never used that one. Cool! :)
Apr 12 13:20:34 <broquaint>	It will be useful I'm trying to compose text with non-ASCII characters, it's proving less useful when writing rust and it's many &references ;)
Apr 12 13:22:35 <broquaint>	It seems Ctrl-\ is what toggles that input-method (and I definitely remember cack-handing that earlier).
Apr 12 13:30:21 <wgreenhouse>	Yup
Apr 12 13:40:37 <roadie>	aidalgol: of course, I forgot about the directory index.html autoload. thank you
Apr 12 14:34:59 <giorgian>	Hi. What's wrong with (call-process-region nil nil command t buffer) where buffer is an existing buffer? I'm getting: (wrong-type-argument integer-or-marker-p nil)
Apr 12 14:35:58 <giorgian>	The docs say "If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents; END is
Apr 12 14:35:58 <giorgian>	ignored."
Apr 12 14:45:46 <giorgian>	I replaced nil nil with (point-min) (point-max) and now it's working.

Apr 12 15:10:23 <offby1>	smells like an actual bug, but that seems unlikely for such a widely-used function
Apr 12 15:10:36 <offby1>	I'd report it to the bug list anyway; it the very least, the doc string is confusing
Apr 12 15:22:00 <xristos>	it's not a bug, he's passing DELETE as t
Apr 12 15:22:14 <xristos>	(call-process-region nil nil command nil buffer) will work
Apr 12 15:24:15 <xristos>	i'd still file an issue to improve the docstring
Apr 12 15:26:08 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: frobnicate the turbo enbugulator
Apr 12 15:26:09 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: adds enbugulator to his vocabularity.

Apr 12 15:28:59 <giorgian>	So, I'm trying to write a function that greps a text in all loaded files, mainly to find out where a message comes from. It's mainly an exercise.
Apr 12 15:29:06 <giorgian>	This is what I got:

Apr 12 15:29:41 <minall>	Hello Emacs Community!
Apr 12 15:30:03 <xristos>	giorgian: you can use M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers
Apr 12 15:30:10 <minall>	I'm configuring my emacs, and I installed dark-room, making it start in every startup?
Apr 12 15:30:32 <minall>	I tried adding a hook and adding (dark-room-tentative-mode 1), but no luck
Apr 12 15:30:37 <giorgian>	xristos: no, I mean all evaluated lisp files, not open buffers
Apr 12 15:31:04 <giorgian>	Questions: 1) I should remove everything from the buffer before writing in it; how exacly? 2) Once my command is done, what is the right way to show the output to the user? 3) Is there a better way to do this?
Apr 12 15:33:09 <minall>	Why does emacs only include ELPA?, I find MELPA being quite good, is for libre reasons?
Apr 12 15:33:56 <roadie>	giorgian: I would record a kbd macro that marks the whole buffer - C-x C-k and done. Then I would add a keycombo for that. I know its klunky...
Apr 12 15:34:06 <andinus>	minall: melpa is not official
Apr 12 15:34:33 <minall>	andinus: What do you mean by not official? 
Apr 12 15:34:39 <sam_c>	it's made by a random guy
Apr 12 15:35:15 <andinus>	yeah emacs team doesnt manage it *officially*, there maybe some emacs dev involved (idk)
Apr 12 15:35:56 <roadie>	some of the melpa packages are in elpa where they become more official to install
Apr 12 15:36:49 <minall>	What is required for a package to be in ELPA?, tere are some good packages that are in ELPA
Apr 12 15:37:25 <wgreenhouse>	minall: following gnu contribution rules for emacs itself (licensing and copyright assignment paperwork)
Apr 12 15:37:29 <minall>	btw, about dark-room more, I added a hotkey, so every time a press C-q darkroom-tentative is activated, however, I want it to be at startup always
Apr 12 15:37:48 <minall>	Thanks for the answers guys, now I understand ELPA better
Apr 12 15:38:55 <roadie>	I would record a kbd macro of pressing the hotkey and then call that macro in .emacs
Apr 12 15:39:35 <roadie>	... after the hotkey is assigned
Apr 12 15:39:47 <andinus>	roadie: how to do that? i mean to record macro and store it
Apr 12 15:40:41 <roadie>	its C-x ( to start the recording
Apr 12 15:41:45 <roadie>	afk - to be continued
Apr 12 15:42:52 <andinus>	roadie: oh i know about that, i mean how do you save it to a file and call it in .emacs?
Apr 12 15:43:22 <xristos>	giorgian: 1. (erase-buffer) or (delete-region (point-min) (point-max)) 2. switch-to-buffer or (message ..) and let the user switch 3. async-shell-command
Apr 12 15:44:29 <giorgian>	xristos: thank you! How do I pass the content of the buffer to message?
Apr 12 15:44:30 <xristos>	minall: melpa has no real oversight, anything goes
Apr 12 15:44:34 <minall>	I do have a hotkey for activating dark-room-tentative-mode, however, I want it to, after startup to be already activated
Apr 12 15:44:45 <xristos>	so i'd avoid loading anything from there, automatically
Apr 12 15:44:57 <minall>	I tried to use hooks but, maybe I'm not using them correctly, and (darkroom-tentative-mode 1) on .emacs
Apr 12 15:44:57 <xristos>	well, i'd avoid using it completely
Apr 12 15:45:15 <xristos>	and that's coming from someone who has his own libraries there ;p
Apr 12 15:45:24 <xristos>	but that was done by others
Apr 12 15:46:03 <minall>	Thanks, I'll try to use only ELPA packages, I'm starting with a minimal install of emacs and that's why I'm stuck with darkroom mode, but I haven't added MELPA yet, and I'm now not planning to 
Apr 12 15:46:07 <giorgian>	minall: (require 'darkroom)(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'darkroom-tentative-mode) seems to work for me
Apr 12 15:46:07 <giorgian>	 
Apr 12 15:46:09 <xristos>	giorgian: you shouldn't pass an entire buffer's contents to melpa
Apr 12 15:46:15 <xristos>	*message
Apr 12 15:46:44 <xristos>	either switch to the buffer or let the user know with a small message so he can switch 
Apr 12 15:47:10 <giorgian>	xristos: you're right, thank you
Apr 12 15:47:14 <xristos>	the latter is preferable when you're executing asynchronous commands
Apr 12 15:47:24 <xristos>	since it's not clear when the results will be ready
Apr 12 15:52:12 <minall>	giorgian: I used the (add-hook) part, but not the (require 'darkroom) part, so that's my error... Such a noob error, well I just started yesterday
Apr 12 15:52:40 <tobiasBora>	Hello, I don't know why but I can't combine both smooth-scrolling-mode and auto-indent-mode.el. I get otherwise an error starting with "apply: Wrong number of arguments: #[(ad--addoit-function arg) ". I put a bug report here, but do you have idea what could go wrong? https://github.com/mattfidler/auto-indent-mode.el/issues/66
Apr 12 15:52:44 <minall>	Is there a part on the manual I should read for configuring emacs?, that will help me, thanks giorgian, I'll add it to my emacs config
Apr 12 15:53:48 <lxsameer>	hey folks, if you use `straight.el` do you know how to write a recipe to install a package by symlinking a directory in my fs instead of using git ?
Apr 12 15:53:50 <roadie>	andinus: (load-file "~/.myEmacsDir/myMacrosFile")      ;; enable my `macros'
Apr 12 15:54:43 <roadie>	(execute-kbd-macro (symbol-function 'myawesomemacro))
Apr 12 15:55:33 <andinus>	roadie: hmm so i did this, F3 C-k F4, that recoreded the macro and i can run it with C-x e, now how do i convert it to myMacrosFile ?
Apr 12 15:55:41 <roadie>	M-x insert-kbd-macro in the myMacrosFile
Apr 12 15:55:47 <andinus>	oh i see

Apr 12 15:56:26 <roadie>	yup - and in the macros file all your macros go so bookmark it

Apr 12 15:57:31 <andinus>	thanks roadie
Apr 12 15:57:40 <roadie>	yw
Apr 12 15:58:11 <roadie>	you can also stop macros for input - very nice feature
Apr 12 15:59:28 <andinus>	can you call macro with names?
Apr 12 15:59:38 <andinus>	like i did test macro, not-test macro
Apr 12 16:00:01 <andinus>	now i want to call test macro, C-x e will call not-test because it was last one
Apr 12 16:00:09 <roadie>	M-x name-last-kbd-macro
Apr 12 16:00:29 <roadie>	do this right after recording
Apr 12 16:00:32 <andinus>	yeah but thats for naming
Apr 12 16:00:35 <andinus>	wait
Apr 12 16:01:19 <andinus>	F3 C-k F4 M-x name-last-kbd-macro test F3 C-x b F4 M-x name-last-kbd-macro not-test
Apr 12 16:01:22 <roadie>	that saves it for the session - to save for posterity you bring up the designated macro file and M-x insert-kbd-macro RET macroname
Apr 12 16:01:27 <andinus>	^ lets say i did this
Apr 12 16:01:53 <andinus>	now i want to call test macro, id ont want to save it anywhere, just call it right now
Apr 12 16:02:04 <roadie>	F5 works here
Apr 12 16:02:19 <andinus>	hmm it says F5 is undefined
Apr 12 16:02:57 <roadie>	(global-set-key [f5] 'call-last-kbd-macro)           ; macro key
Apr 12 16:03:20 <andinus>	huh that will call the last macro
Apr 12 16:03:39 <andinus>	last macro is not-test, i need to call 2nd last macro i.e. test
Apr 12 16:03:52 <andinus>	so basically can you call macro by names quickly?
Apr 12 16:03:52 <roadie>	there is a macro ring - I never use it
Apr 12 16:04:03 <andinus>	i see, i'll look at it
Apr 12 16:04:08 <roadie>	if you named it you can just M-x it
Apr 12 16:04:32 <andinus>	roadie: yeah i was asking that, 
Apr 12 16:04:35 <andinus>	oh it works!
Apr 12 16:04:42 <roadie>	huzzah
Apr 12 16:04:44 <andinus>	cool

Apr 12 16:06:40 <wasamasa>	john conway died :<
Apr 12 16:06:41 <roadie>	I have a kbd macro that pulls 3 hosts files from the net, merges them, unifies the format, erases all comments and duplicate lines and pulls in the header and done to replace the current hosts file - could not figure out how to do that in elisp...

Apr 12 16:24:50 <sam_c>	:(
Apr 12 16:27:40 <giorgian>	When displaying an long image inline, is there a way to scroll vertically by less than the whole image?
Apr 12 16:30:12 <wasamasa>	the classic workaround is cutting up the image into slices :D
Apr 12 16:31:12 <bpalmer>	see pixel-scroll-mode
Apr 12 16:31:29 <bpalmer>	that may do the trick
Apr 12 16:33:53 <holomorph>	pixel-scroll-mode on an image locks up emacs here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 12 16:34:55 <bpalmer>	well, it scrolls by less than an image in that case.
Apr 12 16:35:27 <bpalmer>	rudybot: halting is the same thing as slowing down
Apr 12 16:35:28 <rudybot>	bpalmer: (when ( ... solve some halting problem instance ... ) (fset f 'oh-hai))
Apr 12 16:35:49 <tobiasBora>	I have an issue with LaTeX: usually when I type "C-c ? tikz" it opens the documentation of tikz, but in my new config it does not work... To be more precise, I have no error at all (hard to debug), and I can see okular (my pdf viewer) that loads for a second, and then it just stops.
Apr 12 16:35:54 <tobiasBora>	Any idea how I could debug that?
Apr 12 16:37:26 <bpalmer>	perhaps temporarily replace okular with a program that just logs what it's called with?
Apr 12 16:39:00 <tobiasBora>	bpalmer: Hum, I have some more advances, and it's still stranger
Apr 12 16:39:18 <tobiasBora>	so I wrote a script that "ps aux | grep olular" always to see what's the command
Apr 12 16:39:37 <tobiasBora>	and indeed when I run my command, there is a process that runs the command "/usr/bin/okular /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf"
Apr 12 16:39:51 <tobiasBora>	and if I run this command manually, then the doc just pops out
Apr 12 16:40:23 <tobiasBora>	so my only idea is that maybe emacs kills for some reason the process
Apr 12 16:40:40 <tobiasBora>	do you know how it could be possible?
Apr 12 16:40:50 <tobiasBora>	(and if)
Apr 12 16:42:36 <tobiasBora>	(and also I can see very briefly a line "[okular] <defunct>")
Apr 12 16:46:36 <bpalmer>	It's possible, but I don't know how the system actually works
Apr 12 16:46:36 <giorgian>	bpalmer: thank you, pixel-scroll-mode did the trick. Now I can use elfeed for comic strips
Apr 12 16:59:25 <tobiasBora>	bpalmer: it seems to be a pretty fundamental issue, I just need to load auctex and it fails... http://paste.debian.net/1139942
Apr 12 16:59:36 <tobiasBora>	maybe it's a regression
Apr 12 17:07:19 <work_>	Hello, How to set the variable `truncate-lines` correctly? I tried `(setq truncate-lines 1)` in my init file but it still doesn't works.
Apr 12 17:09:08 <giorgian>	work_: It's buffer-local, so you should set it in each buffer. If you want to set it for every file, for instance, you can set (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () setq truncate-lines 1))
Apr 12 17:10:20 <giorgian>	sorry, that's (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))
Apr 12 17:10:25 <work_>	@giorgian Is this the only way to set it?
Apr 12 17:10:51 <work_>	for all buffers?
Apr 12 17:11:11 <giorgian>	that will work for all opened files. 
Apr 12 17:12:49 <giorgian>	Or you can set it for specific modes adding it to the relevant hook: for text-mode it would be (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))
Apr 12 17:34:28 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some texts need truncating with prejudice.
Apr 12 17:34:30 <rudybot>	bpalmer: There is, however, an implementation that requires only what you'll find in the R5RS, provided that you have a QUOTIENT and REMAINDER that implement either flooring or truncating division for non-negative arguments.
Apr 12 17:35:27 <work_>	giorgian: 
Apr 12 17:35:30 <work_>	Thanks
Apr 12 17:36:29 <bpalmer>	work_: if you truly want it everywhere, it might work to change the default value with setq-default.
Apr 12 17:36:51 <bpalmer>	but find-file-hook is a nice way of only having it operate on files you are opening
Apr 12 17:39:20 <work_>	bpalmer: 
Apr 12 17:40:17 <work_>	bpalmer:  `(setq-default truncate-lines 1)` you mean something like that?
Apr 12 17:42:08 <bpalmer>	yes.
Apr 12 17:44:02 <work_>	bpalmer: It doesn't work for me.
Apr 12 17:44:32 <bpalmer>	OK. Then go with the hook
Apr 12 17:47:33 <ayuce>	work_: if i understand correctly doc says it should be nil or t not 1.
Apr 12 17:48:35 <bpalmer>	"Non-nil means do not display continuation lines." -- 1 is a non-nil value, although maybe not the most obvious one.
Apr 12 17:48:55 <ayuce>	but (boolenp 1) returns nil
Apr 12 17:49:43 <bpalmer>	right, 1 is not a boolean, but the documentation (at least for 26.3) is only about nil vs non-nil
Apr 12 17:49:45 <bpalmer>	And (eq 1 nil) => nil. 
Apr 12 17:49:55 <ayuce>	it says > This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘booleanp’
Apr 12 17:49:56 <work_>	ayuce: I just try with `t` but it doesn't work either. only the hook works.
Apr 12 17:51:32 <ayuce>	ok, hook it is then.
Apr 12 17:52:38 <work_>	It doesn't look nice tho. I was expecting maybe something like `(setq global-truncate-lines t)`.
Apr 12 17:55:13 <codingquark>	,praise wasamasa
Apr 12 17:55:13 <fsbot>	The EMACS is my strength and song; he has become my salvation.  He is my True Editor, and I will praise her, my father's True Editor, and I will exalt her.
Apr 12 17:55:26 <codingquark>	(for nov.el which has goto-toc)
Apr 12 17:55:32 <giorgian>	My erc configuration doesn't work, I keep losing logs...
Apr 12 17:56:02 <codingquark>	And my server that runs znc keeps disconnecting, I keep losing logs...
Apr 12 17:56:56 <giorgian>	it's a pity (and a pita) that #emacs isn't logged
Apr 12 17:57:17 <codingquark>	If I want to know which color the theme uses for hl-line-mode, how do I find out?
Apr 12 17:57:21 <giorgian>	on other channel I can at least go and read the logs on the web archive
Apr 12 17:57:33 <codingquark>	I feel I've messed it up without knowing somewhere in the config
Apr 12 17:57:48 <ayuce>	work_: maybe you could set it through custom. it says it would become default if you do that way.
Apr 12 17:58:58 <thomasb06>	Hi all.  I'm testing ERC!
Apr 12 17:59:06 <work_>	ayuce: you mean using the custom-groupe interface?
Apr 12 17:59:29 <kindaro>	How can I enable a certain minor mode in every buffer by default?
Apr 12 17:59:46 <ayuce>	work_: yes with customize-variable
Apr 12 17:59:47 <kindaro>	thomasb06: It works!
Apr 12 17:59:52 <codingquark>	Well, evidently I have not messed it up, says emacs -Q
Apr 12 18:00:44 <work_>	But if you use a different file for custum variable, the setting won't be portable afaik. or?
Apr 12 18:01:12 <bpalmer>	kindaro: if it's a global minor mode, you just activate it. If it's not ... why do you want it in every buffer? (Emacs creates many internal buffers that normally you don't see at all)
Apr 12 18:02:51 <ayuce>	work_: not if you port that "different file" too.
Apr 12 18:04:13 <kindaro>	bpalmer:  Well, I want it because it is the variable pitch mode and I believe in variable pitch. I have to switch it on every time I open a buffer. I would rather switch it _off_ in those, hopefully rare, circumstances when it does not look good.
Apr 12 18:06:58 <bpalmer>	kindaro: you could add it to something like after-change-major-mode-hook
Apr 12 18:07:28 <bpalmer>	it won't apply to buffers in fundamental-mode, but they're almost certainly internal buffers
Apr 12 18:08:19 <wgreenhouse>	also, most major modes inherit from a few parents (such as text-mode or prog-mode) with appropriate hooks, so you could place variable-pitch-mode in those hooks
Apr 12 18:09:57 <wgreenhouse>	kindaro: also, nothing stops you from making the default emacs face use some variable pitch font, and then use buffer-face-mode to selectively *disable* that
Apr 12 18:11:27 <work_>	ayuce: Yeah but I prefer to avoid that file. so when I move my init, file it is recreated automatically.
Apr 12 18:11:59 <snatcher>	is there a way to prevent html-mode changes to mark-paragraph?
Apr 12 18:12:18 <giorgian>	Wow, the bug I submitted about `call-process-region' has already been fixed!
Apr 12 18:13:52 <wgreenhouse>	giorgian: time travel??
Apr 12 18:13:52 <fsbot>	Of course not!
Apr 12 18:14:33 <giorgian>	wgreenhouse: it got fixed in a couple hours
Apr 12 18:14:38 <wgreenhouse>	nice
Apr 12 18:14:43 <wasamasa>	peak debbugs
Apr 12 18:14:58 <wgreenhouse>	I suspect this is a great time for high bug report responsiveness. %)
Apr 12 18:15:12 <giorgian>	so it would seem
Apr 12 18:15:14 <giorgian>	What is the easiest way to to run my own fork of a (m)elpa package or, better yet, to switch between my fork and the upstream project? How do people do that?
Apr 12 18:15:50 <wasamasa>	download, add to `load-path', set up autoloads as needed (or don't and just require it)
Apr 12 18:16:29 <wasamasa>	or do it the lazy way and use the existing ones package.el created for you
Apr 12 18:16:37 <wgreenhouse>	if you feel the need for more scaffolding, the elisp info manual has some guidance on how to run a local package archive for yourself
Apr 12 18:17:01 <wgreenhouse>	this need is also one of the motivations for ,,borg,, (a git-submodule-based alternative package manager)
Apr 12 18:17:02 <fsbot>	borg is [0] a system for assimilating emacs packages as git submodules. See https://github.com/emacscollective/borg
Apr 12 18:17:02 <fsbot>	[1] WE WILL ADD YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DISTINCTIVENESS TO OUR .EMACS FILE; I MEAN YEAH YOU'VE GOT SOME GOOD FUNCTIONS WE COULD USE. LIKE THAT ONE FOR FINDING ALL USAGES, THAT'S NEAT.
Apr 12 18:17:31 <wgreenhouse>	but all that's actually needed is download the elisp and start messing with it
Apr 12 18:18:40 <wasamasa>	I wonder whether the magic some people use to speed up loading is to set up a directory containing symlinks to all the elisp files and replacing the hellishly long value of `load-path' with one pointing to that directory

Apr 12 18:54:47 <bremner>	rudybot: sometimes I think YouTube doesn't really understand me: https://youtu.be/K4FESGjiH3s
Apr 12 18:54:58 <rudybot>	bremner: all over youtube, maybe start here http://youtu.be/50L44hEtVos (iirc the sicp video lessons also have all or most of the interesting stuff)

Apr 12 18:55:45 <Misha_B>	it's a good channel tbh
Apr 12 19:06:00 <SLeePy1234>	I wrote a small function using request and json to get some data from an api, the problem is that when I execute the function step by step with edebug it goes fine, while when I execute it normal without debugger it outputs nil
Apr 12 19:06:39 <grym>	i had to look like three times to see if i was in the right channel, heh

Apr 12 19:07:42 <wasamasa>	also, when doing async stuff don't forget to enable lexical binding or else
Apr 12 19:08:50 <bpalmer>	async is a conspiracy to foist lexical scope upon an unsuspecting world?

Apr 12 19:11:03 <bremner>	fancy. previewing links?
Apr 12 19:11:19 <scheming_around>	My emacs prints this at startup: "undefined: KEY must be an integer, cons, symbol, or string"
Apr 12 19:11:26 <scheming_around>	My .emacs.d/init.el is commented out
Apr 12 19:11:36 <technomancy>	kindaro: you must have installed a library for that; check the value of erc-modules
Apr 12 19:11:40 <scheming_around>	That error message isn't printed with emacs -Q
Apr 12 19:11:41 <bpalmer>	there is an erc-youtube module 
Apr 12 19:11:46 <bpalmer>	probably you have that active.
Apr 12 19:11:59 <bremner>	scheming_around: do you have some emacs packages installed via the OS?
Apr 12 19:12:21 <scheming_around>	Nope
Apr 12 19:12:26 <scheming_around>	I'm on macOS btw
Apr 12 19:12:43 <kindaro>	 Oh, I have youtube listed in modules. That's Spacemacs's doing. 
Apr 12 19:12:54 <bremner>	scheming_around: do the messages show up with -q ?
Apr 12 19:13:02 <scheming_around>	nope
Apr 12 19:13:47 <bpalmer>	scheming_around: do you have an ~/.emacs ? Do you have modules installed via package such as from elpa or melpa?
Apr 12 19:15:36 <scheming_around>	I do not have an ~/.emacs
Apr 12 19:15:49 <scheming_around>	I do have packages installed via melpa
Apr 12 19:16:10 <scheming_around>	should I delete~/.emacs.d/elpa and try again
Apr 12 19:16:47 <M4rkD>	Is there a nice way to "restart" an ewoc from a file? I'm going to guess not...
Apr 12 19:17:13 <bremner>	ewoc?
Apr 12 19:17:15 <fsbot>	ewoc is [0] a structure that organizes information required to construct buffer text that represents certain Lisp data. see (info "(elisp) Abstract Display")
Apr 12 19:17:15 <fsbot>	[1] not to be confused with the small hunter-gatherer teddy bears inhabiting the forest moon of endor
Apr 12 19:17:35 <bremner>	TIL
Apr 12 19:17:55 <bpalmer>	scheming_around: try moving it somewhere else, at least.
Apr 12 19:17:56 <M4rkD>	For some context, I've written a major mode to interact with a REST service, namely Azure DevOps (it's a bit like Jira if you're familiar)
Apr 12 19:17:58 <ornxka>	hi what is the "make emacs hang indefinitely" key
Apr 12 19:18:09 <ornxka>	i would like to know so that i can take care to not press it by accident
Apr 12 19:18:39 <M4rkD>	I was googling around for ways to do that, and I found about ewocs... so I tried them and they worked.
Apr 12 19:18:53 <M4rkD>	but I'm not convinced I'm doing things in particularly idomatic ways... :)
Apr 12 19:18:59 <bpalmer>	ornxka: if you're in a terminal, perhaps you're encountering the scroll lock functionality of C-s 
Apr 12 19:19:13 <bpalmer>	ornxka: if C-q gets you back up and running, that's likely it
Apr 12 19:19:15 <scheming_around>	bpalmer no effect :/
Apr 12 19:19:35 <ornxka>	bpalmer: nope it is the gtk gui
Apr 12 19:19:51 <ornxka>	minimizing and then reopening the window fixes it
Apr 12 19:20:13 <M4rkD>	Basically, the idea is that there are "tasks" on the remote server. I show one per line in my major mode, and have some keybindings to call remote services to change each task.
Apr 12 19:21:11 <M4rkD>	I made an ewoc for this, and added each task as an entry. It works quite nicely, despite having to write a lot manually...but I would really like to be able to save my file to disk and reload it in an "active" state...
Apr 12 19:22:09 <M4rkD>	I feel like I've made a wrong choice using an ewoc...they're neat, but I've lost some of the power of simple plain text...!
Apr 12 19:23:43 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: step 1 is to serialize whatever data you need to a file format, so in your mode override C-x C-s to do something. Whether that's just writing down the text directly as is, or writing all your state in a json serialization , or ..
Apr 12 19:24:05 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: then if a file is being opened in your mode, and it's not empty, reconstruct it all
Apr 12 19:24:35 <M4rkD>	Yeah, thanks bpalmer. Sounds sensible.
Apr 12 19:24:45 <bpalmer>	I don't think ewoc is a particularly common package to use, but it should be possible
Apr 12 19:25:13 <M4rkD>	I think it should be possible, I'll just end up with a text file that doesn't refect what's on screen. :)
Apr 12 19:26:10 <M4rkD>	I'm wondering, what would be the "idomatic" way to do this? I feel like I've started digging (it's my first big-ish major mode) and followed a weird route...
Apr 12 19:27:12 <M4rkD>	I didn't find a ton of stuff out there for people getting started with major modes, in terms of common patterns etc.
Apr 12 19:30:13 <M4rkD>	I think I should somehow be able to get the buffer that is shown on screen to just be a fontified version of the text file. It has all the information it needs to interact with the remote service.
Apr 12 19:32:57 <wgreenhouse>	ornxka: might've been ,,dk C-z,, which you should just unbind
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	suspend-frame is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘frame.el’.
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	It is bound to C-z, C-x C-z.
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	(suspend-frame)
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	Do whatever is right to suspend the current frame. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 12 19:33:04 <M4rkD>	Dunno... maybe I'll persist down this route, using the serialisation suggestion (thanks bpalmer!), and think how to do things differently next time. :)
Apr 12 19:49:18 <bpalmer>	rudybot: if you don't talk to your kids about unix, someone else will.
Apr 12 19:49:20 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I think everyone should atleast have a very high-level understanding of "computer hacking", so it makes me happy when I hear people do have an intrest in it. I actually wish it was a class in grade or middle-school, and they throw kids into a unix shell and/or a emacs session.
Apr 12 19:49:34 <Aurora-Sensei>	bpalmer: lol
Apr 12 19:50:56 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: most modes I can think of roll it all by hand.
Apr 12 19:51:01 <bremner>	rudybot: talk to your kids about being Eunuchs
Apr 12 19:51:01 <rudybot>	bremner: but if all the kids tv shows show eunuchs then kids will think it's cool
Apr 12 19:51:12 <bremner>	that's the plan
Apr 12 19:51:44 <bpalmer>	rudybot: you can't just start writing targaryen propaganda before the watershed.
Apr 12 19:51:49 <rudybot>	bpalmer: daenarys targeren, cersei lannister, arya stark, brienne of tarth, melisandre, catlyn stark, olenna tyrell, yara greyjoy, ygrette, lyanna stark, ellaria sand, lyanna mormont, Rhaella targaryen ... all VERY strong and powerful female characters, and that's just in the tv series. I think the books had even more, but I never read them. You're not sure if that's very many? I'm sure that's quite a lot of very strong (and

Apr 12 19:55:33 <rudybot>	roadie: apparently fracking is to be given the go-ahead here because it is only likely to cause small earthquakes.
Apr 12 19:55:47 <bpalmer>	I don't think rudybot is much of a reader
Apr 12 19:57:37 <roadie>	he knows an awful lot though

Apr 12 19:59:30 <roadie>	it be nice to have a comrade bot and a wallstreet bot - they could insult each other
Apr 12 19:59:59 <scheming_around>	I managed to fix my issue by building the latest emacs from master
Apr 12 20:01:26 <scheming_around>	I have a different issue now: Emacs isn't starting evil-mode by default
Apr 12 20:01:43 <bpalmer>	did you move your packages back?
Apr 12 20:01:48 <scheming_around>	(use-package evil  :init  (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll  t        evil-want-integration t        evil-want-keybinding nil)  :bind ("C-e" . move-end-of-line)  :config (evil-mode 1)  (use-package evil-collection    :after evil    :config    (evil-collection-init)))
Apr 12 20:01:55 <scheming_around>	^ my config for evil-mode
Apr 12 20:02:09 <scheming_around>	i just nuked my packages and had emacs re-install them
Apr 12 20:02:28 <scheming_around>	right now the only package I have installed is evil-mode
Apr 12 20:02:46 <scheming_around>	and use-package I guess
Apr 12 20:02:50 <scheming_around>	(and all deps)
Apr 12 20:03:19 <roadie>	so you just switched issues?
Apr 12 20:03:39 <scheming_around>	Well I've had the evil-mode issue for a while nwo
Apr 12 20:06:32 <roadie>	I have to stick to emacs 25.3 - hyperbole 7.0.3 and zenburn from a long time ago so I don't have issues. plus ido-ubiqutous from the ancient times.
Apr 12 20:07:17 <M4rkD>	Thanks for the insight bpalmer! As a bit of a mode writing newbie, I'm still trying to get a feel for it. One of things I haven't gotten my head around yet is a feel for where to store data. This time I've opted for a hash table as a "database" that stores all my data, and the buffer is a "view" layer on the top. But it seems to me quite an "emacsy" thing to make the buffer the data store... I'm thinking of how I imagine modes
Apr 12 20:07:17 <M4rkD>	writable grep might work. Is it encouraged to try and follow the "data as plain text in a buffer when possible" approach...? Maybe I'm reading too much into it? :)
Apr 12 20:08:15 <bpalmer>	I think data as plain text in buffer is definitely a tradition in emacs
Apr 12 20:09:11 <bpalmer>	although it causes pain if, for example, you don't take care to make the buffer read-only and manually inhibit readonlyness while the mode itself controls all writes to the buffer
Apr 12 20:10:21 <tobiasBora>	Hello,
Apr 12 20:10:39 <tobiasBora>	I'd like to know, I really like the "use-package" syntax for :bind and :map.
Apr 12 20:11:01 <tobiasBora>	Is it possible to use this syntax also for code that is not a package?
Apr 12 20:14:58 <M4rkD>	Yeah, to be honest bpalmer, as someone new to all this - it sounds to me like an all-round painful approach to take. R
Apr 12 20:15:06 <M4rkD>	:)
Apr 12 20:15:48 <M4rkD>	Maybe it isn't so bad when you know what you're doing. :)
Apr 12 20:17:03 <ekleog>	Is there a way to have (ansi-)term kill its buffer when the process exits?
Apr 12 20:17:04 <M4rkD>	I do like that the buffer you see is what you save, and also what you see if you ever venture to another editor. That is awesome.
Apr 12 20:18:15 <ayuce>	tobiasBora: hello, doc says no.
Apr 12 20:18:29 <M4rkD>	But reopening a file for complex-ish mode, and reliably reparsing the contents...
Apr 12 20:19:32 <M4rkD>	Anyways, probably something that gets easier with a bit of experience....
Apr 12 20:20:25 <M4rkD>	Anyways, thanks for taking the time to share some thoughts bpalmer. Very appreciated.
Apr 12 20:26:15 <tobiasBora>	ayuce: too bad... Thanks

Apr 12 20:46:32 <Aurora-Sensei>	ts
Apr 12 20:50:16 <noobly>	does emacs calc not have a built in tool for computing limits? 
Apr 12 20:51:50 <Aurora-Sensei>	It might have something in symbolic mode
Apr 12 20:52:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	Ah, nvm.
Apr 12 20:52:48 <Aurora-Sensei>	It truly seems to lack it.
Apr 12 20:53:01 <Aurora-Sensei>	That's an interesting limitation.
Apr 12 20:53:17 <noobly>	that's so odd, it has derivatives, integrals, summations, etc.. I wonder why it lacks limits
Apr 12 20:53:30 <noobly>	Aurora-Sensei: nice pun :^)
Apr 12 20:53:40 <Aurora-Sensei>	noobly: Unintended, but indeed.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	It's moreso interesting because limits are kind of essention to both integration and derivation.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	*essential
Apr 12 20:54:46 <noobly>	that's my thinking too, i wsa unsure if maybe the limit functionality was there as a subset of some other functionality, but if so i can't find it
Apr 12 20:55:41 <Aurora-Sensei>	I think it might qualify for filing a bug. 
Apr 12 20:58:08 <Misha_B>	lets implement spiders in emacs, to catch all the bugs
Apr 12 20:59:46 <Aurora-Sensei>	Might not the code get caught in their webs?
Apr 12 21:12:45 <Misha_B>	just lube the code up with some lard
Apr 12 21:15:12 <aidalgol>	Don't do that.  It'll break the condom.
Apr 12 21:25:17 *	Aurora-Sensei snerk
Apr 12 22:08:53 <klay>	Morning
Apr 12 22:09:19 <aidalgol>	Aurora-Sensei: Nothing to do with Emacs, but have you considered Sage if you're after a CAS?
Apr 12 22:11:48 <klay>	I'm sorry for a stupid question, but how I can compare a symbol with a result of `make-symbol'?  I was surpised '(equal (make-symbol "foo") 'foo)' is nil :-/
Apr 12 22:13:19 <jfb4>	,channel-wisdom
Apr 12 22:13:21 <fsbot>	email at least has a spec; blogs just have "various objections to dave winer"
Apr 12 22:13:31 <aidalgol>	I think this has something to do with symbol interning, which I have never fully understood
Apr 12 22:14:36 <edgar-rft>	klay: (equal (symbol-name 'foo) (symbol-name (make-symbol "foo"))
Apr 12 22:15:02 <klay>	Oh
Apr 12 22:15:27 <klay>	edgar-rft: Thank you!
Apr 12 22:15:30 <edgar-rft>	klay: but note that these are still two different symbols with the same name
Apr 12 22:15:43 <aidalgol>	wtf?
Apr 12 22:15:48 <klay>	omg
Apr 12 22:16:10 <aidalgol>	,(equal 'foo 'foo)
Apr 12 22:16:11 <fsbot>	t  ..(symbol)
Apr 12 22:16:22 <aidalgol>	oh, right, make-symbol actually *makes a new symbol*
Apr 12 22:16:27 <aidalgol>	AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!
Apr 12 22:16:30 <aidalgol>	whyyyyy?
Apr 12 22:16:36 <jfb4>	klay: see C-h S make-symbol 
Apr 12 22:16:40 <technomancy>	I think that means that you just shouldn't use make-symbol at all?
Apr 12 22:16:54 <technomancy>	intern is usually what I use to go from string->symbol, in the rare cases where that's needed
Apr 12 22:16:55 <jfb4>	technomancy: I believe it's used by gensym
Apr 12 22:17:02 <edgar-rft>	aidalgol: because make-symbol returns an uninterned symbol
Apr 12 22:17:10 <technomancy>	jfb4: makes sense, but then ... just use gensym =)
Apr 12 22:17:15 <aidalgol>	This isn't a problem in scheme, is it?
Apr 12 22:17:47 <technomancy>	no, because hygiene is so confusing in scheme that you just don't bother writing macros at all
Apr 12 22:18:12 <edgar-rft>	aidalgol: no, because Scheme doesn't have make-symbol :-)
Apr 12 22:18:13 <Aurora-Sensei>	aidalgol: I haven't needed CAS in a while, but yes, I'm aware of Sage. I used Maxima at the time though.
Apr 12 22:18:32 <klay>	jfb4: Got it, thank you
Apr 12 22:18:35 <aidalgol>	technomancy: You find defsyntax confusing?
Apr 12 22:18:38 <aidalgol>	er, define-syntax
Apr 12 22:18:44 <aidalgol>	*More* confusing than defmacro?
Apr 12 22:19:01 <technomancy>	aidalgol: oh yeah, way more confusing. defmacro is trivial.
Apr 12 22:19:16 <aidalgol>	Also, isn't it only confusing in scheme because CL and elisp don't even bother with hygiene?
Apr 12 22:19:23 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Huh... defmacro breaks my brain.
Apr 12 22:20:04 <aidalgol>	Then again, you are an alien hacker from a distant exoplanet.
Apr 12 22:20:25 <technomancy>	aidalgol: Scheme found one very complex way to avoid symbol capture, where elisp and CL just say "be careful and don't make mistakes"; meanwhile clojure and fennel have very simple ways to avoid symbol capture without complicating things.
Apr 12 22:20:45 <Aurora-Sensei>	Hy uses much the same way as Clojure.
Apr 12 22:20:56 <technomancy>	(they taint symbols which come from backtick and refuse to allow them to be used as identifiers)
Apr 12 22:21:41 <technomancy>	when you look at the incredible hoops scheme has to jump thru to achieve the same results, it really looks like a judo move that gets you 98% of the benefit with 5% of the effort.
Apr 12 22:22:51 <jfb4>	technomancy: a glance at the emacs source shows many uses of make-symbol, but spot-checking about 5 they are all in some variation of defmacro. must be some deep reason 
Apr 12 22:22:55 <aidalgol>	Sounds like Clojure has some really neat ideas.  Shame it exists in such a corporate ecosystem that lacks the same free-software spirit.
Apr 12 22:23:43 <technomancy>	aidalgol: luckily that idea is easy to steal =)
Apr 12 22:23:47 <klay>	Aha!  It works!  Thank you guys
Apr 12 22:24:28 <klay>	Now I have ‘(completing-read "Tags frontend: " '(ggtags rtags disable))’ in my custom defun and just `pcase' to compare
Apr 12 22:43:16 <quiliro>	I saw someone asked how to command mpv to play a video link. I read browse-url-of-dired-file was suggested. But that tryes to open lynx. How can I make it run mpv --ytdl-format=best URL_at_point
Apr 12 22:43:17 <quiliro>	?
Apr 12 22:44:11 <quiliro>	Changing shr-external-browser to mpv --ytdl-format=best
Apr 12 22:44:12 <quiliro>	?
Apr 12 22:44:34 <Aurora-Sensei>	Select it "m-x |" urxvt -e mpv - ?
Apr 12 22:44:44 <rrix>	you can customize browse-url-browser-function 
Apr 12 22:45:21 <Aurora-Sensei>	Hm, seems not tow ork, unfortuante, nevermind.
Apr 12 22:47:12 <rrix>	how would i go about resetting current-idle-time, it seems like the only things that do are in C source code? I am sick of EXWM not resetting idle time when I am typing in to a window
Apr 12 22:50:23 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Is it possible to steal in racket, or is it too low-level to retrofit onto an existing lisp?
Apr 12 22:51:37 <dmartincy>	I have a regular expression written in an Elisp file. If I do (buffer-substring-no-properties BEG END) I get a regexp that is escaped, so if pass that to another function that receives a regexp, the result is wrong. Is there any way I can get the unescaped regexp from the Elisp buffer so that I can pass it to other functions and get the expected result?
Apr 12 22:51:57 <technomancy>	aidalgol: technically speaking you could definitely add it to racket; socially speaking everyone will shun you because they value macro hygiene way too much.
Apr 12 22:52:10 <technomancy>	well, not shun, but ... laugh awkwardly when you bring the topic up and quickly move on to something else?
Apr 12 22:52:17 <technomancy>	racketeers are too nice to shun
Apr 12 22:54:06 <wrycode>	the racket crowd is indeed very friendly 
Apr 12 22:54:25 <wrycode>	are?
Apr 12 22:55:34 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Doesn't that still count as hygiene, just in a different way?
Apr 12 22:56:05 <technomancy>	aidalgol: that's not an unreasonable argument, but I don't think schemers see it that way
Apr 12 22:56:26 <technomancy>	for one thing it's easy to bypass intentionally (but hard to bypass by accident)
Apr 12 22:57:18 <aidalgol>	right
Apr 12 22:57:20 <nikitam>	So I'm having a brainfart moment once more. I'm trying to build from source. INSTALL says to ./configure in the source dir but it doesn exist.
Apr 12 22:57:29 <aidalgol>	not a hill I care to die on. :)
Apr 12 23:01:10 <rrix>	eugh, why is timer_start_idle not exported to elisp?
Apr 12 23:01:40 <nikitam>	https://pastebin.com/knA5JCpZ
Apr 12 23:03:47 <ayuce>	you should run autogen.sh first
Apr 12 23:03:51 <sam_c>	nikitam: you often need autogen.sh
Apr 12 23:05:15 <nikitam>	Cool, thanks.
Apr 12 23:11:03 <quiliro>	eww
Apr 12 23:11:06 <quiliro>	sorry
Apr 12 23:52:06 <bpalmer>	dmartincy: can you show an example? I suspect you're misinterpreting something.
Apr 12 23:53:15 <bpalmer>	(But maybe I am guessing too much at what the issue is; an example would help check)
Apr 12 23:57:53 <angelo__>	where is the whitespace.el located ? i see it only in the emacs sources. Is it possible to modify it ?
Apr 12 23:58:58 <dmartincy>	bpalmer: For example, an Elisp file may have the regexp "\\(Hello\\)". I want to extract that and pass it to a function like (xr-pp) to get (group "Hello") as a result. The problem is, if I use (buffer-substring-no-properties), what it really passes is (xr-pp "\\\\(Hello\\\\)"), which is a different thing.
Apr 12 23:59:06 <wgreenhouse>	angelo__: you can always make your own copy and put it somewhere in load-path
Apr 12 23:59:29 <angelo__>	wgreenhouse, ah ok. I try.
Apr 12 23:59:32 <angelo__>	thanks
Apr 12 23:59:42 <wgreenhouse>	yw
Apr 13 00:00:22 <dmartincy>	bpalmer: I think I need to use the (read) function or a variation so that it works on the text representation of the regular expression. Am I correct?
Apr 13 00:09:38 <epony>	"n|m" dashes in URLs considered harm%E2%80%93furll (tried to report it in #org-mode but nobody can fix it).. so if anyone uses Emacs org-mode, a normal dash (minus) between normal (lisp) brackets breaks the hyperlink parser
Apr 13 00:18:26 <zfnmxt>	Is there a nice way to see keybindings within emacs when using 'evil-collection'? When I do something like 'C-h m' I just get the emacs bindings.
Apr 13 00:21:09 <Profpatsch>	In haskell-mode, something is blocking for like 500ms ever few edits.
Apr 13 00:21:31 <Profpatsch>	Is there a view where you can see what is blocking the editor at the moment?
Apr 13 00:24:25 <Profpatsch>	Or just trace everything that happens after I hit a key, until the editor is listening for inputs again?
Apr 13 00:31:37 <dale>	Profpatsch: You can set debug-on-quit to t (or M-x toggle-debug-on-quit) and then C-g to try and interrupt whatever is blocking, hopefully dropping you into the debugger.
Apr 13 00:54:15 <Profpatsch>	Hm, sounds like a plan
Apr 13 01:05:33 <scheming_around>	Is there a method to use use-package with scripts such as this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColumnMarker
Apr 13 01:12:15 <dale>	scheming_around: If you download the Elisp (files) and put them on load-path, you can probably just load it normally with use-package.  You could use something like https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package to install them directly from the wiki, I think there are mixed feelings in the community about doing that.
Apr 13 01:19:51 <clmg>	How can I improve the performance of emacsclient? I don't mean the server, but the actual client frame initialization.
Apr 13 01:20:43 <jamzattack>	Use --with-x-toolkit=no instead of gtk
Apr 13 01:20:56 <clmg>	I use terminal emacs
Apr 13 01:21:37 <clmg>	There's about 1 second between running `emacsclient -nw .` and being able to actually see the dired buffer.
Apr 13 01:21:44 <nikitam>	I do not envy terminal emacs maybe because I couldn't comforably set it up in gentoo.
Apr 13 01:22:12 <nikitam>	It made clunking around the OS much easier, though. clmg: what's your window manager?
Apr 13 01:22:27 <clmg>	karmen: http://karmen.sourceforge.net/
Apr 13 01:23:11 <nikitam>	That looks like Mac OS 7
Apr 13 01:23:42 <nikitam>	It's probably super simple and minimal, I bet.
Apr 13 01:23:43 <jamzattack>	Looks just like twm
Apr 13 01:24:00 <clmg>	I love it. It has served me well for ~3 years
Apr 13 01:24:58 <nikitam>	It says Wind has superceded it, 6 years ago. Any huge difference?
Apr 13 01:25:49 <jamzattack>	Speaking of, does anyone know a WM that can launch another WM?  twm and ratpoison are the only ones that I know
Apr 13 01:25:57 <clmg>	I haven't tried wind.
Apr 13 01:26:07 <nikitam>	xdm?
Apr 13 01:26:21 <technomancy>	jamzattack: awesome does, I think
Apr 13 01:26:47 <clmg>	xdm is great
Apr 13 01:27:44 <nikitam>	I'm sad I had to scrap my gentoo. I learned a lot.
Apr 13 01:28:09 <jamzattack>	but xdm doesn't let you keep the same programs open, does it?
Apr 13 01:28:22 <nikitam>	I had to prioritize getting proprietary software to work for school so I had to choose between Redhat and Debian.
Apr 13 01:29:02 <nikitam>	jamzattack: Not to my knowledge. I think you can just use it alone or delegate the task to another wm.
Apr 13 01:29:19 <rwp>	jamzattack, Don't you just exit or kill one window manager and then just start another to switch?
Apr 13 01:30:14 <rwp>	That's the way I have always done it.  With the typical window manager system.  Not with the heavier Desktop Environments.
Apr 13 01:30:34 <nikitam>	rwp: I wonder how complex it would be to have all your window sessions persist in something heavy.
Apr 13 01:31:10 <rwp>	What fails to "persist"?
Apr 13 01:31:49 <rwp>	I mean if I have Firefox open, a dozen xterms, Emacs, and a dozen other random X programs, those all persist, right?
Apr 13 01:31:53 <nikitam>	Open applications, perhaps. If the processes keep running and one has enough RAM it seems feasible.
Apr 13 01:37:26 <spikemaster>	ratpoison
Apr 13 01:38:49 <nikitam>	spikemaster: This looks cool.
Apr 13 01:39:49 <jamzattack>	Yeah I usually start twm or ratpoison and switch to EXWM, just wondering if there was another floating wm that does this so that I can get back to tty without manually killing Xorg 
Apr 13 01:41:40 <nikitam>	Don't most systems have a set of getty sessions open on boot?
Apr 13 01:42:19 <nikitam>	I guess I'm getting my head scrambled between OpenRC and Systemd
Apr 13 01:51:50 <clmg>	Is there a way to get tint2 to draw without having a wm window?
Apr 13 02:00:28 <grym>	i just picked up i3
Apr 13 02:00:31 <grym>	so far so good 
Apr 13 02:06:14 <aidalgol>	I tried Marathon yesterday.  It has not aged well.
Apr 13 02:10:19 <technomancy>	aidalgol: the second and third feel a lot smoother imo
