Apr 22 22:18:28 <mbrumlow>	I am aware of the read one, but the write one is confusing because on blocking IO my man page said that it will be 0, or all of the buffer, unless a unrecoverable error happens.

Apr 22 22:22:03 <mbrumlow>	once you are in the write syscall to a blocking file -- a signal can't stop you. 
Apr 22 22:22:26 <mbrumlow>	Only on non blocking file handles can write decide to write some and return. 
Apr 22 22:22:36 <mbrumlow>	With the one exception on blocking handles -- no more space. 
Apr 22 22:22:42 <mbrumlow>	or out of quota. 
Apr 22 22:23:06 <mbrumlow>	None of those are "fixable" in such that you can just retry your write continuing where you left off. 
Apr 22 22:23:18 *	jlf- (~jlf@pdpc/supporter/active/jlf) has joined
Apr 22 22:23:43 <mbrumlow>	So for write retries on blocking IO you really should only need to resend the entire write command on EINTR. 
Apr 22 22:24:54 <bpalmer>	mbrumlow: I'm slightly skeptical; I see the note that the function returns -1 with errno=EINTR only when EINTR happens before any data is written.

Apr 22 22:25:53 <bpalmer>	mbrumlow: I believe without thinking too hard about it that if you try to write() more data than, e.g., fits in a single TCP packet with a file descriptor bound to a tcp socket, you'll risk being interrupted partway through.
Apr 22 22:26:11 <mbrumlow>	yeah, but writing to sockets is different. 
Apr 22 22:26:24 <bpalmer>	no it isn't. write only cares about file descriptors
Apr 22 22:26:47 <mbrumlow>	The man page calls out fd that refer to sockets differently.

Apr 22 22:28:37 <tyrese`>	Keep it physically on disk - don't actually load it when emacs starts. Mostly to just trim emacs down so there isn't a bunch of stuff I never use in ivy etc
Apr 22 22:29:04 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: this is what autoloads accomplish (which are used extensively by emacs)
Apr 22 22:29:44 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: an autoload function is a stub that, when called, actually loads the library which then replaces the stub with the real code (and calls it)
Apr 22 22:30:00 <tyrese`>	oh, that's interesting 
Apr 22 22:30:15 <bpalmer>	tyrese`: if you are installing packages from elpa, melpa, etc, use-package automates some of the work for you.
Apr 22 22:30:24 <bpalmer>	or, *can* automate some of it.
Apr 22 22:30:26 <paluche>	of course, that stubbed function will show up in e.g. M-x
Apr 22 22:30:38 <wasamasa>	tyrese`: you can experiment with the new pdump feature to make an emacs only preloading the things you need
Apr 22 22:30:40 <bpalmer>	if it's marked as interactive, yes.

Apr 22 22:36:03 <xtifr>	The stubbed autoload function *itself* shows up in C-h/M-x/etc., but all sorts of related functions won't until the module is properly loaded. Which can sometimes be bizarre if you are looking for a documented function that hasn't actually been loaded yet--especially if it was there the last time you ran emacs. :)

Apr 22 22:45:41 <Snowbear>	Freed up about 100 gigs from my drive doing it.
Apr 22 22:45:47 <Snowbear>	yeah I had notmuch and mbsync before.
Apr 22 22:45:58 <Snowbear>	but I uninstalled them and deleted all the mail stores
Apr 22 22:46:05 <Snowbear>	so ~/Mail is totally empty atm
Apr 22 22:46:19 <parsnip>	okay, but i mean, if you go to the webmail in chrome/firefox, are you sure there's no evidence of copying
Apr 22 22:46:22 <parsnip>	Snowbear: ^
Apr 22 22:46:29 <Snowbear>	yeah absolutely.
Apr 22 22:46:33 <Snowbear>	I use it all the time at the moment.
Apr 22 22:47:00 <parsnip>	Snowbear: okay, and if you only have Gnus setup with a single imap, is there no evidence of copying?
Apr 22 22:47:00 <Snowbear>	I use airmail on my phone but it never has conflated my multiple accounts.
Apr 22 22:47:13 <Snowbear>	i don't know how I would check for that.
Apr 22 22:47:18 <parsnip>	Snowbear: did you test on a computer web browser, like gmail.com
Apr 22 22:47:28 <Snowbear>	yeah I can go there right now again. hang on

Apr 22 22:48:11 <xtifr>	npostavs: ivy's completion isn't anchored at the start of the string, so that could get messy
Apr 22 22:48:14 <parsnip>	rudybot: whatever can go wrong, will go wrong
Apr 22 22:48:17 <rudybot>	parsnip: I used to use a router with the linux router thing on it. whatever that's called. but I worry about doing that. when things go wrong it's tough.
Apr 22 22:48:59 <Snowbear>	Yeah there's literally no evidence of that in my web gmail accounts.
Apr 22 22:49:03 <Snowbear>	I just checked.
Apr 22 22:49:45 <xtifr>	Type "g" and ivy loads every module which *might* match the letter "g"? That wouldn't be good, to say the least...

Apr 22 22:50:50 <Snowbear>	I'm at a loss too. 
Apr 22 22:51:02 <Snowbear>	If I load all mail on one account, I get all mail on all accounts.
Apr 22 22:51:13 <parsnip>	Snowbear: i suspect you did something funny with your mbsync or offlineimap configs, and it's leaving behind traces that are not obvious in the webmail app
Apr 22 22:51:30 *	techquila has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
Apr 22 22:51:35 <Snowbear>	hrm
Apr 22 22:51:52 <Snowbear>	well mbsync is off my machine completely.
Apr 22 22:52:00 <Snowbear>	So that can't be a culprit
Apr 22 22:52:01 <parsnip>	that does not conflict with my statement
Apr 22 22:52:22 <Snowbear>	the only thing i have running is msmtp and I know that's configured correctly because it worked flawlessly with notmuch.
Apr 22 22:52:34 <Snowbear>	hrm
Apr 22 22:52:37 <Snowbear>	how would I check for that?
Apr 22 22:53:03 <parsnip>	i can think of a few tedious things that might help probe, but i'm not sure if they'll find anything
Apr 22 22:53:04 *	_g_p_ (~user@static-3-150-225-77.ipcom.comunitel.net) has joined
Apr 22 22:53:19 <xtifr>	but still, "cal" would match both "calc" and "calendar", so ivy would have to load both, whereas with regular builtin completion, it won't load any modules until I actually press tab.
Apr 22 22:53:21 <wasamasa>	meh, I can't make the hack work on shell even
Apr 22 22:53:28 <wasamasa>	why is everything involving buffers such a mess
Apr 22 22:53:37 <Snowbear>	okay
Apr 22 22:53:38 <parsnip>	i guess there's some way to ping imap with telnet?
Apr 22 22:53:45 <wasamasa>	the thing emacs is supposed to be good at is such a frustration
Apr 22 22:53:59 <Snowbear>	I honestly have no idea.
Apr 22 22:54:02 <parsnip>	Snowbear: first, check if the imap issue only appears in gnus. try thunderbird and/or mutt

Apr 22 22:54:33 <Snowbear>	but I'll install mutt tomorrow and see.
Apr 22 22:54:41 <parsnip>	lol, "i have a question and i'm going to bed"
Apr 22 22:54:45 <Snowbear>	No no
Apr 22 22:54:58 <Snowbear>	I posted it there in the hopes that somebody would answer it overnight
Apr 22 22:55:13 <parsnip>	i kind of recommend thunderbird first, i feel it will go faster to give some indication
Apr 22 22:55:20 <Snowbear>	Okay. I can do that.
Apr 22 22:55:22 <Snowbear>	Thank you. :)
Apr 22 22:55:34 <Snowbear>	I didn't know thunderird was still a thing. I thought they closed the project years and years ago.
Apr 22 22:55:39 <parsnip>	but generally, when futzing with imap, mbsync, offlineimap, i recommend having mutt setup too
Apr 22 22:55:49 <parsnip>	i might have said this to you a week ago
Apr 22 22:56:04 <Snowbear>	Maybe. I don't remmeber. I did get notmuch to work, and it really worked well.
Apr 22 22:56:19 <Snowbear>	except it doesn't sync deleted messages and it's incredibly difficult to do so...

Apr 23 01:34:10 <jcob>	but it helps you out so you dont have to write frees at the bottom of everything
Apr 23 01:34:23 <jcob>	(and doesnt have all the C++ cruft)
Apr 23 01:34:24 <oni-on-ion>	i really like it. but the ::'s and the something().unwrap().unbox().borrow()   is a bit hefty

Apr 23 01:40:18 <jcob>	now writing c++ is practically cheating with valgrind, gdb, clang static analyzer (seriously clang static analyzer is some wizard $hit)
Apr 23 01:40:30 <oni-on-ion>	most people saying bad rep of c++ is because of the 90s afaik
Apr 23 01:40:45 <oni-on-ion>	oh yeah? is it like type inference  stuff ?
Apr 23 01:41:07 <jcob>	oh no i mean it goes through your code and tells you potential problems (uninitialized values, unfreed mem etc)
Apr 23 01:41:24 <jcob>	it can follow tons of branches and figure out stuff you would have never have thought of

Apr 23 05:42:11 <cjb>	codingquark: G'day! :)
Apr 23 05:42:21 *	cjb is slow today
Apr 23 05:42:24 <twb>	I don't know about modern VNC clients, but I assume they have an equivalent
Apr 23 05:43:15 <parsnip>	i'm guessing this is partly a case of, "i am quite comfortable in lisp"
Apr 23 05:43:16 <xristos>	mbrumlow: it's a combination of things
Apr 23 05:43:18 <xristos>	Emacs GC is terrible
Apr 23 05:43:23 <xristos>	term.el is terrible
Apr 23 05:43:32 <xristos>	as in the code sucks and it's not written with performance in mind
Apr 23 05:44:05 <xristos>	i bet someone well-versed elisp optimization could write a terminal emulator that's 2-3x faster than ansi-term
Apr 23 05:44:26 <mbrumlow>	twb: the problem is the config is on the remote system, the backstory is I have a huge ball of json sitting on the screen, and I either have to copy and paste it to the local system to view formatted, or try my best to sort it out on the terminal to find the prot, and the password. 
Apr 23 05:44:30 <xristos>	in fact i started doing that myself some time ago but i never found the inspiration to finish it ;p
Apr 23 05:44:47 <twb>	haha you're parsing json using regexps?
Apr 23 05:44:49 <parsnip>	xristos: i guess they'd have to know a lot about terminals and shells too
Apr 23 05:45:13 <mbrumlow>	xristos: I messed around with term.el abunch, I am not sure any amount of changing of the lisp is going to fix it. 
Apr 23 05:45:23 <twb>	xristos: I think they'd actually be better to know about terminal optimization than elisp optimization :-)
Apr 23 05:45:24 <xristos>	mbrumlow: it needs a complete rewrite
Apr 23 05:45:32 <mbrumlow>	xristos: not even then. 
Apr 23 05:45:52 <twb>	e.g. dalias
Apr 23 05:45:55 <xristos>	well it's still going to be slow compared to a native terminal emulator
Apr 23 05:45:55 <mbrumlow>	xristos:I broke it down to the smallest one could, just the process, and the filter, only handling new lines ans scrolling. 
Apr 23 05:46:10 <mbrumlow>	xristos: and it was still just as slow. 
Apr 23 05:46:14 <xristos>	mbrumlow: we've had this discussion before
Apr 23 05:46:16 <twb>	But what does term.el get you?  NOTHING, except that the terminal window lives inside emacs's frame instead of being a separate X window
Apr 23 05:46:18 *	codingquark offers a few pages containing latest manifestos produced by political parties of India for the elections

Apr 23 05:49:05 <mbrumlow>	xristos: maybe I was idk, eshell simple test seems fast enough. 
Apr 23 05:49:23 <xristos>	mbrumlow: process filters are everywhere in Emacs
Apr 23 05:49:25 <mbrumlow>	oni-on-ion: I am in exwm :/ 
Apr 23 05:49:28 <xristos>	if they were slow you'd know it ;p
Apr 23 05:50:15 <parsnip>	interesting to be in exam and _still_ not want to use a dedicated terminal
Apr 23 05:50:23 <mbrumlow>	xristos: I was not making a claim it is the filter.

Apr 23 05:55:10 <mbrumlow>	eshell is keeping a much larger buffer
Apr 23 05:56:07 <twb>	xristos: getting useful problem reports out of mbrumlow is difficult
Apr 23 05:56:38 <mbrumlow>	xristos: right now I am just timing dmesg -- not very exciting. 
Apr 23 05:57:12 <xristos>	mbrumlow: yes so eshell doesn't do terminal emulation so there's a whole layer of additional processing for _each character_ that term.el needs to do

Apr 23 06:00:15 <codingquark>	twb: congress says they'll give 6k monthly to the people below poverty line.

Apr 23 06:00:24 <mbrumlow>	xristos: so I can avoid the slowdown over time issue by setting term-buffer-maximum-size to zero. Not entirely though, there is some slowdown that gets reset after GC. 
Apr 23 06:00:25 <codingquark>	For no work
Apr 23 06:00:37 <twb>	codingquark: should give it to everyone instead of means testing

Apr 23 06:00:58 <twb>	mbrumlow: nope
Apr 23 06:01:01 <codingquark>	No
Apr 23 06:01:16 <xristos>	twb: that seems like a bad idea
Apr 23 06:01:19 <codingquark>	Do you know Indian poverty?
Apr 23 06:01:19 <xristos>	anyway i'm going to sleep 
Apr 23 06:01:24 <twb>	mbrumlow: it means people will look after babies or work in soup kitchens or make paintings, instead of doing make-work crap jobs
Apr 23 06:01:29 <mbrumlow>	Oh, start a fight with UBI then leave... 
Apr 23 06:02:01 <twb>	mbrumlow: and if we still need someone so e.g. clean toilets, then they'll do that so they can get extra money to buy an xbox
Apr 23 06:02:02 <mbrumlow>	twb: their babies, or other peoples babies? 
Apr 23 06:02:06 <twb>	mbrumlow: either
Apr 23 06:02:30 <twb>	currently looking after your own baby is basically not considered part of the economy, because nobody pays you to do it
Apr 23 06:02:32 <codingquark>	India has this thing called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005
Apr 23 06:02:40 <mbrumlow>	twb: what is the poverty line? That is the main issue I have. I think things like UBI might work, but only if *everybody* gets them. 
Apr 23 06:03:11 <twb>	mbrumlow: that's why it's called "universal"
Apr 23 06:03:12 <mbrumlow>	twb: If there is a cutoff, then sometimes it might be better simply to not work because you will pop over that line for 100, and loose out on 6000 
Apr 23 06:03:24 <twb>	mbrumlow: that is exactly the argument against means testing
Apr 23 06:03:30 <mbrumlow>	twb: Sorry, I am referring to codingquark: thing.
Apr 23 06:03:44 <codingquark>	You really need to look at it from India's perspective. Where a poor family means they don't have clothes to wear, no schools to go to. Where they literally die of hunger.
Apr 23 06:03:46 <mbrumlow>	Where they will give 6k to people below. 
Apr 23 06:04:01 <twb>	"poverty line" is routinely criticized by academia because there is not a magical difference between "I live on $2/day" and "I live on $2.01/day"
Apr 23 06:04:16 <mbrumlow>	twb: Seems we are on the same page now -- well at least I am now. You were on the page already. 
Apr 23 06:04:39 <twb>	:-)
Apr 23 06:04:58 <twb>	codingquark: we have the same thing in australia, it's just not talked about
Apr 23 06:05:15 <twb>	like there's 200,000 homeless people in melbourne
Apr 23 06:05:22 <codingquark>	Say this family is able to earn like 1200. Then the govt will give 4800
Apr 23 06:05:52 <codingquark>	twb: I see. How bad is it?
Apr 23 06:06:02 <twb>	codingquark: but that means you have to have officers who decide how much they are really earning
Apr 23 06:06:11 <twb>	codingquark: to make sure it's 1200 and not 1200 + 300 cash
Apr 23 06:06:30 <twb>	codingquark: if you just give *everyone* 6000, regardless, it's much easier, and you don't get weird edge cases
Apr 23 06:06:43 <codingquark>	That is true
Apr 23 06:06:48 <twb>	codingquark: e.g. "I am getting 6000 for doing nothing, but if I get a job for 6500 I have to work all day"
Apr 23 06:06:56 <mbrumlow>	Unless you don't have 6000 to give to everybody... 
Apr 23 06:07:14 *	cjb has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Apr 23 06:07:31 <twb>	And giving everyone 6000 doesn't cost much more compared to e.g. mining tax cuts that are already done to keep rich people rich
Apr 23 06:07:41 <twb>	looking at you, Adani corporation...
Apr 23 06:08:04 <mbrumlow>	codingquark: I have been to India -- at least the parts I was in it did not seem like anybody would be starving. Shitty living conditions? Sure, but food did not really seem like it was an issue.
Apr 23 06:08:48 <codingquark>	Yeah, you haven't seen India.
Apr 23 06:09:02 <twb>	mbrumlow: india is huge and e.g. SC/ST population is different in each state
Apr 23 06:09:26 <twb>	It's like saying "I went to NYC in 1925 and I didn't see ANY okies"
Apr 23 06:09:34 <mbrumlow>	Also, my gauge was probably a shitty one.
Apr 23 06:10:02 <twb>	codingquark: the main concern with UBI, I think, is if one country has it but the next country over doesn't, so you get edge cases there
Apr 23 06:10:26 <mbrumlow>	I tend to judge these things by the number of fat dogs laying in the streets. 1) If the dog is able to get fat, then there is spare food. 2) If you were really hungry, there might be no dog :/ 
Apr 23 06:10:47 <twb>	codingquark: but even when that happens, it's happening to individual humans, who have a limit on how much they can abuse the system.  Compare with multinationals moving one country over to get 20% less corporate tax, who can abuse the system enough to kill entire cities

Apr 23 07:23:20 <Snowbear>	oh and I put "install mutt" on my todo list today as per your suggestion
Apr 23 07:23:31 <fourier_mode>	A bit off-topic, but what is exactly the advantage of TUI email clients over GUI ones i.e. is it worth the switch?

Some highly regarded emacs users use GNUS but I believe they all retrieve gmail in a separate, offline process."
Apr 23 07:25:38 <parsnip>	twb: right, as Snowbear reiterates, i suggested thunderbird as a user-friendly way to quickly test some issue Snowbear describes.
Apr 23 07:25:56 <parsnip>	twb: that way, he doesn't have to be spoon fed special commands or configs >.<
Apr 23 07:25:59 <twb>	Because IMAP is slow and Emacs isn't (historically) multi-threaded, doing gnus -> imap.gmail.com was historically STRONGLY contra-indicated.  To the point that jgoerzen wrote "offlineimap" to allow gnus to talk to a local nnmaildir or nnimap

Apr 30 16:04:40 <parsnip>	i actually stopped letting one of the dogs annoy me, because it at least reduced somewhat in frequency, and i don't expect much out of the owner, given their demeanor
Apr 30 16:05:02 <parsnip>	but the other neighbor that does fine, i feel like he should know how to figure it out
Apr 30 16:05:58 <parsnip>	competent affluent people should work it out
Apr 30 16:06:04 <TDT>	Some people may need to just be informed.  Some though take that very offensively.  It's kinda annoying.  I have one neighbor like that.  most are good, but one seems to be highly offended at even the sight of me, let alone if i try to talk with her
Apr 30 16:07:16 <bpalmer>	Some dog breeds are designed to bark. (This may mean that they're not good in, say, a city environment). For example, I think Great Pyrenees look like great dogs, but would only consider getting one in the countryside

Apr 30 16:10:36 <TDT>	yeah, some people use dogs as protection, and the louder ones work for that.  My cousin has a giant dog that is...well, mean, very mean, at least in my opinion.  He got the dog to protect his daughters as they were growing up.  I get that, but it's one of about a dozen reasons why I don't visit them ever.

May 18 19:52:43 <ieure>	Unlikely
May 18 19:52:59 <wasamasa>	the difference is the amount of people looking at it

May 18 19:56:32 <wasamasa>	yes, we love to make fun of stupid breakage when someone doesn't think through a npm module release, but honestly, do you prefer having a byte-code compiler as your linter or a handful of competing external linters with configurable rules and ever-expanding features like fixing up your code and rewriting it?
May 18 19:56:56 <wasamasa>	alternatively, take a look at what php went through

May 18 20:03:47 <wasamasa>	anyway, I don't have any illusions regarding it

May 18 20:04:24 <xenodasein>	I tried a  feature in Visual Studio and wonder if it could be simulated in emacs: when you press C-<TAB> a list of currently open files appear and as you keep pressing the control button you can select between the list items using tab or arrow keys. When you *release* the control the current item is selected and selection thingy is closed.
May 18 20:04:38 <wasamasa>	nope

May 18 20:04:40 <xenodasein>	So the main problem is how can we use the control key which is a modifier  with emacs in this manner, or if it is possible at all?
May 18 20:04:44 <wasamasa>	it isn't
May 18 20:04:51 <johnjay>	is emacs on freebsd?
May 18 20:04:53 <wasamasa>	currently emacs supports this only for the mouse events

May 18 20:05:17 *	tiwula has quit (Quit: Leaving)
May 18 20:05:19 <wasamasa>	and considerable thought about how to expose it in lisp
May 18 20:06:31 <wasamasa>	you could maybe do a terrible hack like a program on the X/wayland/AHK/... level that detects such events and sends a special key sequence to inform emacs that a modifier has been pressed and released again
May 18 20:06:51 <wasamasa>	this fits in beautifully into the above discussion why elisp rocks and sucks at the same time
May 18 20:07:05 <offby1>	worse is better
May 18 20:07:14 <wasamasa>	it rocks because you can try out such things with relatively little effort, it sucks because it's an absolute pain to pull it off
May 18 20:07:48 <xenodasein>	I suppose that functionality could be done using some non-modifier key, using a timer hack for key release?
May 18 20:08:33 <wasamasa>	well, it doesn't need to be a timer hack
May 18 20:08:39 <wasamasa>	I did such a thing for chip8.el
May 18 20:08:46 <xenodasein>	nice
May 18 20:08:47 <wasamasa>	it's not exactly nice, but it works
May 18 20:09:10 <wasamasa>	the emulated platform has opcodes to query whether a key is pressed or not

Jun 13 21:49:13 <MrFantastik>	I'm gonna have to play with this
Jun 13 21:50:34 <dale>	ediff is kind of intimidating the first time you use it.
Jun 13 21:50:48 <dale>	And also subsequent times you use it.
Jun 13 21:51:15 <MrFantastik>	it looks like it could work for what I'm doing though
Jun 13 21:51:20 <TreyHarris>	I'm confused what y'all are talking about when you say "logical hunks"... I use logical hunks carefully to commit, but to merge? That sounds very strange to me. If you've made your commits discrete logical hunks, you should be able to rebase and/or use rerere (which you have to break out of magit for unfortunately); then you'll only get at worst empty conflicts whose only merge requirements are agreeing to the
Jun 13 21:51:22 <TreyHarris>	conflict resolution by hitting 's' on the unstaged empty hunk
Jun 13 21:52:03 <MrFantastik>	TreyHarris: sometimes I'm comitting three months of changes to my dotfiles in one commit

Jun 13 21:53:17 <TreyHarris>	MrFantastik: oh. If it's dotfiles, then presumably no one else is synced up with your remotes, so you can go to the original branch and split a commit using interactive rebase
Jun 13 21:53:42 <TreyHarris>	That's much cleaner than picking out hunks from an existing commit to apply
Jun 13 21:54:22 <TreyHarris>	The thing that keeps people from doing that is because they're sharing branch state with others, and once you've pushed, you should never rewrite history in the same branch
Jun 13 21:54:23 <MrFantastik>	mmmk I'll give that a shot

I've noticed that the package `ascii` has been removed from CRAN, maybe this has

Jun 14 12:45:20 <dired>	is it possible to open new window in dired (C-o) to the left of the frame (rather than to the right - which keep dired listing to the left)?
Jun 14 12:46:01 <dired>	so that i don't have to swap windows manually everytime :-)

Jun 14 16:11:11 <twainwek>	dale: yes, it does after jedi:setup under ~/.emacs.d/.python-environments/default
Jun 14 16:11:15 <dale>	twainwek: Also FWIW, I think I'm almost always using Python 2.

Jun 14 16:16:44 <subopt>	npostavs: Yes, i asked the question wrong. Found the solution though: directory-abbrev-alist
Jun 14 16:18:22 <subopt>	Is there a way to use env vars when directing `find-file` to the file you want?

Jun 14 16:29:28 <dale>	twainwek: Your #1256 was reportedly a duplicate of my https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/issues/1242, and for that one it just took me doing approximately anything in Emacs with Python for a few minutes in order to reproduce that issue.

Jun 14 16:33:58 <dale>	twainwek: It is interesting that you say you're having this problem while running in a virtual environment, since setting the virtual environment environment variables was the fix for #1242 IIUC.

If the photon gets absorbed and re-emitted then you will not see a very shiny-looking surface as there will be other detection events possible from other paths; this is a natural consequence of "a photon stays over in this state for a time, then the

Jun 16 21:31:08 <npostavs>	xtifr: you mean emacs -nw can make a transparent terminal opaque?  That seems a bit strange to me
Jun 16 21:31:27 <xtifr>	I agree, I had to try it to believe it
Jun 16 21:31:33 <gpk>	xtifr: it does, but I use a theme, and the theme gets applied and make the background opaque again
Jun 16 21:31:55 <gpk>	It works with emacs -Q -nq
Jun 16 21:31:57 <gpk>	-nw
Jun 16 21:32:00 <gpk>	I mean
Jun 16 21:32:13 <gpk>	But with a theme.. it goes back to being opaque
Jun 16 21:33:01 <xtifr>	also confirmed
Jun 16 21:33:09 <xtifr>	quite odd, I must say
Jun 16 21:33:29 <gpk>	I can make the whole frame translucent with sway, but that's not great because then the text is translucent too

Jun 16 21:34:26 <npostavs>	Isn't this a bug in the terminal?
Jun 16 21:34:46 <gpk>	Not sure
Jun 16 21:35:03 <gpk>	If emacs is sending it opaque colour codes then it's unclear what the terminal should do
Jun 16 21:35:15 <gpk>	And I think that is what is happening
Jun 16 21:35:32 *	devroomdog has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jun 16 21:35:58 <gpk>	And in fact I'm sure that is what is happening because it happens for other programs
Jun 16 21:36:14 <gpk>	The parts of htop that do have a background colour for example
Jun 16 21:36:18 *	igemnace has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.5)
Jun 16 21:36:49 <gpk>	So I suppose a solutoin could be to not set the background colour in the theme
Jun 16 21:36:59 <npostavs>	"opaque colour codes"? why is that a thing? Shouldn't all background colours be translucent?
Jun 16 21:37:27 <xtifr>	'TERM=xterm emacs -nw' works
Jun 16 21:37:40 <gpk>	Hah, OK, it was as easy as that
Jun 16 21:37:44 <xtifr>	so apparently it's a 256-color-term thing
Jun 16 21:37:48 <gpk>	I just remove the :background frmo the theme
Jun 16 21:38:32 <gpk>	xtifr: that doesn't work for the theme I'm using

Jun 16 23:30:08 <daniele->	yrk: what was the GFDL designed for? the GFDL with the invariant sections is not even DFSG compatible... i think that many see the invariant section clause as a bad idea nowadays
Jun 16 23:31:15 <yrk>	daniele-: the gfdl wasn't designed to be dfsg compatible. and there is stuff debian do that isn't fsf compatible. what's the point?
Jun 16 23:31:42 <yrk>	daniele-: these are two organizations who place difference emphasis on particular points; that's fine
Jun 16 23:31:51 <yrk>	daniele-: but that doesn't say anything about the gfdl
Jun 16 23:32:04 <daniele->	yrk: what's the design choice that makes the invariant sections a good idea?
Jun 16 23:32:37 <xtifr>	or making "chmod -r" illegal a good idea?
Jun 16 23:32:51 <yrk>	daniele-: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-howto-opt.html#SEC1
Jun 16 23:33:38 <yrk>	daniele-: "good idea" intimates that there is an objective truth here. there isn't. if you don't think something is a good idea... there is a name for that. it is called opinion.
Jun 16 23:33:42 <daniele->	yrk: that made a little sense when the primary form of consuming the licensed material was in printed form
Jun 16 23:33:53 <yrk>	daniele-: how so?
Jun 16 23:34:22 <yrk>	daniele-: I'm speaking as a gnu maintainer who has never had a lick of trouble with the gfdl... and constantly wonders what the big deal it about
Jun 16 23:34:40 <daniele->	yrk: because the text was there for you to find it without serarching for it. now that invariant section on the emacs manual online is mostly wasted bits
Jun 16 23:35:37 <yrk>	daniele-: wasted bits?! the javascript on the smallest webpage you've ever loaded into a modern browser is 100 time larger
Jun 16 23:35:41 <daniele->	yrk: i have no troubles with it, i'm just saying that the invariant senctions make it complicated for very little gain, if any
Jun 16 23:35:50 <yrk>	daniele-: that's your problem!?
Jun 16 23:36:02 <daniele->	yrk: i don't have any problem

Jun 16 23:41:50 <yrk>	daniele-: it wasn't printed in a manual. it was a part of the docs inside emacs
Jun 16 23:41:56 <daniele->	yrk: don't get me wrong, my journey is probably very similar to yours
Jun 16 23:42:10 <ozzloy>	ie "don't make it look like my personal opinion is something other than this."
Jun 16 23:42:21 <ozzloy>	seems like a personally reasonable thing to be able to do
Jun 16 23:42:21 <yrk>	ozzloy: I honest have no idea. people _love_ to hate invariant sections without every, and I do mean ever, having an actual problem with them
Jun 16 23:42:52 <yrk>	oh no! my software project burst into flames. darn you, invariant sections!
Jun 16 23:43:00 <ozzloy>	heh
Jun 16 23:43:30 <yrk>	ozzloy: but there are also people who feel that nothing should be ND, to use creative commons' nomenclature
Jun 16 23:43:50 <yrk>	ozzloy: I get their argument, but I personally don't subscribe to it
Jun 16 23:45:16 <yrk>	daniele-: so just because we two don't need to read the invariant sections in a gnu manual about software freedom anymore, doesn't mean that a kid in Bangladesh, Mogadishu, or some other place should be denied them.
Jun 16 23:45:37 <daniele->	yrk: as i already expressed, i have no problems with the gdfl or the invariant sections in particular, i just consider them not very useful. if you want to rephrase this as "love to hate" it is your choice, but it would not help you to argue your position

Jun 16 23:49:43 <yrk>	xtifr: lgpl also can be upgraded to gpl, but that isn't because of the licensing exceptions.
Jun 16 23:49:49 <ozzloy>	xtifr, i've wondered about that before.  what's your real world example?
Jun 16 23:49:52 <daniele->	yrk: why are you reiterarting this "being against"?
Jun 16 23:50:19 <daniele->	yrk: isn't there a difference between considering somethign nto very useful and being againts?
Jun 16 23:50:33 <yrk>	daniele-: ok. I'll modify it to: being "somewhat perturbed" by invariant sections, but enough to argue about it on irc...
Jun 16 23:51:12 <daniele->	yrk: somewhat perturbed?
Jun 16 23:51:42 <daniele->	yrk: are you discussing with me only because my opinion makes you feel "somewhat perturbed"?
Jun 16 23:52:23 <xtifr>	ozzloy: wanting to explain in comment why I'm coding something a certain way, easiest is to quote the docs of what I'm calling, but I can't because the license won't allow it
Jun 16 23:52:58 <yrk>	xtifr: the documentation strings of the functions are licensed under gfdl?!

Jun 16 23:53:24 <yrk>	xtifr: that doesn't make any sense at all. if a project is doing that, they should change.
Jun 16 23:53:31 <daniele->	xtifr: unless you are embedding _pages_ of manual material in the source code, copying a few lines is just fine
Jun 16 23:53:41 <yrk>	xtifr: what daniele- said
Jun 16 23:54:16 <xtifr>	maybe, but fair use isn't recognized everywhere
Jun 16 23:54:48 <yrk>	xtifr: so, the problem is that you want to copy bits of the manual into the code?
Jun 16 23:54:55 <xtifr>	and C doesn't have "documentation strings"
Jun 16 23:55:05 <xtifr>	yes
Jun 16 23:55:07 <ozzloy>	ok, i hope no one gets mad but... i just license everything under both the gfdl and the agpl.
Jun 16 23:55:23 <yrk>	ozzloy: that's a common solution

Jun 16 23:56:43 <daniele->	yrk: a while ago there were a thread on emacs-devel about moving example code from the manua to a source file (or viceversa) and the licen was an issue. i don't know how it has been solved tho (being emacs, the solution has probably been to keep the think as it was)

Jun 16 23:58:44 <yrk>	daniele-: but I agree that nobody should be putting large chunks of useful code into manuals. that simply doesn't make sense no matter what documentation license you use. mostly code should live in source files with comments, and mostly text should live in manuals with snippets of code
Jun 16 23:58:49 <daniele->	yrk: i think the issue was having the exampel code being inserted into the manual from an external code file, or something
Jun 16 23:58:59 <bpalmer>	yrk: it is a licensing issue; however, it's one that the FSF can trivially solve
Jun 16 23:59:55 <yrk>	bpalmer: yes. that is a way of looking at it.
Jun 17 00:00:06 <daniele->	or having someone copy code from the manual to a source file and so doing making the source file gfdl derived
Jun 17 00:00:29 <yrk>	similarly, dinner is a issue I can trivially solve. thank you everyone for a interesting conversation, excluding various heresies about garlic bread

Jun 17 08:10:55 <bpalmer>	Not using a theme is literally not specifying a theme.

Jun 17 08:11:20 <eising>	(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)
Jun 17 08:11:27 <eising>	for example
Jun 17 08:11:37 <bpalmer>	eising: yes, start emacs with no config; you'll see it is not using a theme.
Jun 17 08:11:38 <techquila>	well i went to gnu emacs site bpalmer and couldn't find anything even remotely like it.  And now that you made your smartass comment I went back to double check. it's not obvious at all.  worded poorly.

Jun 17 08:13:15 <bpalmer>	techquila: *shrug* there's all sorts of ways to figure out if a project is active.
Jun 17 08:13:31 <eising>	well, I like my themes when I use the gui version, but the terminal theme of iterm2 on mac really messes up the colors, making emacs unusable since you can't read anything
Jun 17 08:13:50 <techquila>	i know the project is active.. that was tongue in cheek reference to the fact that it's not apparent from the website
Jun 17 08:13:53 <eising>	anyway, I'll experiment a bit and see what I end up with :)

I'm really surprised and a bit horrified this is how this project is run, but I guess it's working for y'all.

Jun 17 08:51:28 <cjb>	techquila: I don't know how to say this, but here goes: I think if you go into a project wanting to change how things are done, or even just saying its a horrible way to do it, you'll run into a lot of resistance. People may end up despising you without ever hearing you out. Instead learn the ins and outs of how it is done on project xyz, and stick with it for like 6 months.
Jun 17 08:52:04 <techquila>	a proper website, complete with roadmap, integrated wiki, discussion channels etc.

Jun 17 08:56:57 <cjb>	oh, you go to further info, then it has a Savannah link. I was wrong
Jun 17 08:57:14 <john2x>	I tried (erc :server "my_znc_server.com" :port 5000 :nick "john2x" :password "john2x/freenode:hunter2") but I just get 'Connection failed!'
Jun 17 08:57:33 <bpalmer>	john2x: is there something listening on port 5000?
Jun 17 08:58:07 <daniele->	cjb: the bug tracker is not on savannah
Jun 17 08:58:17 <techquila>	daniele-, email has been abused. I'm not saying here, or by GNU, but in general.  There are much better ways to desiminate information on a timely basis, to those who need it, and much more accessible ways for interested public onlookers to search through.
Jun 17 08:58:39 <john2x>	bpalmer: well the web admin interface is accessible at port 5000. Would the irc port be different? 
Jun 17 08:58:48 <daniele->	techquila: for example?

Jun 17 09:00:28 <daniele->	techquila: what bpalmer says
Jun 17 09:00:36 <john2x>	their wiki/docs only mention one port. that seemed strange to me as well
Jun 17 09:01:13 <bpalmer>	john2x: try 6667 for plaintext, 6697 for TLS
Jun 17 09:01:21 <bpalmer>	those are the typical irc ports.
Jun 17 09:01:28 <daniele->	techquila: savannah is just how the emacs git repo is setup, nothing you need to care about to contribute
Jun 17 09:02:34 <techquila>	a well maintained project website, complete with roadmap, integrated wiki, discussion channel.  Option to email notifications if thats what you're into
Jun 17 09:03:23 <daniele->	techquila: what is a "discussion channel"?

Jun 17 09:10:36 <techquila>	nrosvall  i'm not sure what projects you manage but I would expect something that has been in existence as long as emacs, with as many users, and contributors would have a roadmap.
Jun 17 09:10:40 <thebigj>	Hello everyone!
Jun 17 09:10:51 <daniele->	or what's there is exactly to be managed, given that all who hack on emacs are doing so for the glory?
Jun 17 09:10:57 <klostein>	techquila: it's lots of work to actually keep one up to date
Jun 17 09:11:07 <nrosvall>	roadmap might be ok if there's resources (time) to actually keep up with it.
Jun 17 09:11:08 <klostein>	techquila: let alone stick to it and churn out features at the expected rate
Jun 17 09:11:30 <klostein>	techquila: emacs is a volunteer project, it moves along as people donate their time and patience to improve it
Jun 17 09:11:58 <klostein>	techquila: so it moves forward to whatever a contributor considers important and gets accepted
Jun 17 09:12:08 <adamantium>	isn't Emacs don'e already?
Jun 17 09:12:12 <klostein>	far from it
Jun 17 09:12:15 <adamantium>	;)
Jun 17 09:12:17 <klostein>	take a look at the NEWS files
Jun 17 09:12:31 <klostein>	there are many small things in there that improve your editing experience

Jun 17 09:13:59 <klostein>	techquila: the emacs contributor community isn't exactly thriving
Jun 17 09:14:31 <klostein>	there is much red tape involved
Jun 17 09:14:35 <john2x>	bpalmer: I needed to use (erc-tls ...) 
Jun 17 09:14:40 <klostein>	sometimes things are forgotten and rediscovered years later
Jun 17 09:15:02 <klostein>	sometimes contributors walk away because they don't consider it worth their time
Jun 17 09:15:24 <techquila>	perhaps then you all will want to reflect on how you treat people interested in contributing, advising you y'all the issues/barriers that exist that make contributing somehting people want to do then?
Jun 17 09:15:26 <klostein>	and that's perfectly fine
Jun 17 09:15:38 <klostein>	emacs doesn't want to grow beyond what it can handle
Jun 17 09:15:44 <klostein>	it's a super stable project

Jun 17 09:16:04 <klostein>	I've only seen one rushed release, for a security issue
Jun 17 09:16:19 <klostein>	perhaps it's better to compare emacs with other gnu projects, like gcc

Jun 17 09:18:51 <klostein>	the basic problem I see here is that contributions are optimized towards maintainers, not contributors
Jun 17 09:18:52 <daniele->	techquila: you said that. you are saying that someone should "improve" how emcs development is "managed". do you thing that that comes for free?
Jun 17 09:19:06 <klostein>	this is fair because maintainers end up shouldering the burden
Jun 17 09:19:36 <twb>	techquila: is there a specific problem with Emacs project management, that you want fixed?

Jun 17 10:26:38 <twb>	due date: 12 years ago
Jun 17 10:26:41 <twb>	completion: 5%
Jun 17 10:27:54 <lampilelo>	RMS would come there, write "word processor" and it would be SO USEFULL because noone wants to work on that and people just tell him "so go and implement it"

Jun 17 10:30:31 <lg188>	and communication gets fuzzy because it's retold by so many people in the chain
Jun 17 10:30:48 <klostein>	there are smaller projects pulling it off if there's paid contributors
Jun 17 10:31:24 <klostein>	others sacrifice something else, like stability/quality of the project
Jun 17 10:31:26 <lg188>	that's because the company wants to know what they're investing in, I guess

Jun 17 10:36:13 <carmack>	Hi guys what do you think about emacs Doom?
Jun 17 10:36:22 <bpalmer>	it's inevitable.
Jun 17 10:36:47 <twb>	is it like rldoom?

Jun 17 10:37:05 <twb>	Frankly I think doom is pretty boring.
Jun 17 10:37:07 <bpalmer>	nothing may escape its wyrd.
Jun 17 10:37:30 <twb>	Really to modernize it, you need to have a ten-second sex scene at the end that's only accessible after 50 hours of crappy dialogue
Jun 17 10:37:55 <twb>	bpalmer: now I am thinking about a t-shirt that says "BUT DOES IT DREE?"
Jun 17 10:39:07 <lg188>	so doom emacs is just a different spacemacs ?
Jun 17 10:39:29 <klostein>	looks like yet another emacs config to me
Jun 17 10:39:57 <twb>	the one that really impressed me was the one that makes the whole emacs shake and stars appear around the cursor if you code fast enough
Jun 17 10:40:13 <twb>	sort of a "combo damage" vibe

Cheap because it doesn't generate any trench-digging work for labourers who live inside the country.

Since the 1980s they both represent the rich dickheads, because they own the TV, and the TV tells voters that what dickheads want is what they want.
Jun 22 16:25:18 *	caoliver points lamely at Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent.
Jun 22 16:25:54 <twb>	parsnip: and Dickhead Lite had an "invest in infrastructure" plan, like FDR or your interstate network, except it was to fix up our shit internet
Jun 22 16:25:55 <parsnip>	I'm pretty close to having my app initialize to RUB if your locale is russia, even if I havent translated the UI to russia
Jun 22 16:26:58 <caoliver>	The rise of an FDR-like politician requires a better educated public though.  (grumble grumble)
Jun 22 16:27:04 <twb>	parsnip: but Dickhead Party was like "building things?  That's so 18th century.  We only do financial instruments now."
Jun 22 16:27:14 <parsnip>	franklin d Roosevelt?
Jun 22 16:27:15 <twb>	caoliver: well, or a GIANT DEPRESSION
Jun 22 16:27:19 <twb>	parsnip: yeah
Jun 22 16:27:40 <twb>	parsnip: as USian leaders go he was relatively socialist (AFAICT)

Jun 22 20:36:53 <bexx>	you're right
Jun 22 20:37:19 <bexx>	parsnip: also in tryRFC3339: 'Probar RFC 3339' is more like try
Jun 22 20:37:25 <bexx>	parsnip: try is a verb
Jun 22 20:37:34 <parsnip>	ah nice, thank you

Jun 22 20:41:38 <parsnip>	apple uses title case more. but the framework is google, so fuck it.

Jun 22 20:42:12 <Illya>	what do you guys do about all the buffers which look like *this*? is there a way I can hide them except say, org-related buffers in the C-x b menu?
Jun 22 20:43:31 <dale>	Illya: If you're using Ivy then you could hide them with ivy-ignore-buffers, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

Jun 22 21:14:30 <parsnip>	interesting question
Jun 22 21:14:57 <johnjay>	idk, i just think there should be
Jun 22 21:15:15 <parsnip>	n and p are easy, it's the next or previous sibling i think
Jun 22 21:15:24 <parsnip>	[ and ] i'm not sure what to call that
Jun 22 21:15:34 <johnjay>	like you could call same level jumps 'hops' and ones that ascend or descend 'climbs'
Jun 22 21:15:59 <parsnip>	parent for u is fine for me, and child for <integer>

Jun 22 21:16:01 <johnjay>	i know there's prefix, infix, and postfix that get used for binary trees
Jun 22 21:16:08 <johnjay>	i guess
Jun 22 21:16:11 <johnjay>	so sibling?
Jun 22 21:16:24 <parsnip>	sibling for n,p, is what comes to mind to me, yes
Jun 22 21:16:28 <johnjay>	forward-sibling, back-sibling
Jun 22 21:16:34 <parsnip>	_i'm_ satisfied 😉
Jun 22 21:16:43 <johnjay>	up-parent, down-parent
Jun 22 21:17:14 <parsnip>	next and prev would be better, since you're already using the letters n, p
Jun 22 21:17:19 <johnjay>	you still need to differentiate between [ and n which was my main point
Jun 22 21:17:19 *	neosloth has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jun 22 21:17:36 <parsnip>	yes, [, ] is the interesting bit. they're not simply next sibling
Jun 22 21:17:59 <johnjay>	[ and ] are more like postfix and infix traversal
Jun 22 21:18:00 <parsnip>	i'm _sure_ there's a word for it. my instinct is to go ask on ##algorithms, but i should search the web
Jun 22 21:18:06 <johnjay>	maybe forward-traverse and backward-traverse?
Jun 22 21:18:34 <johnjay>	or maybe just forward backward
Jun 22 21:18:40 <johnjay>	since you're traversing the tree in a linear fashion
Jun 22 21:19:29 *	neosloth (~neosloth@192.157.106.221) has joined
Jun 22 21:19:37 <johnjay>	actually infix would be interesting to define for non-binary trees

Jun 23 22:16:55 <dale>	jmarciano: I think C-h m will list all active modes at the top.  Most often you can also C-h v name-of-the-mode RET to see if the variable is non-nil.

Jun 23 22:18:00 <dale>	jmarciano: If you need to do it programmatically, just looking at the mode's variable is what I typically use.  If you're talking about a major-mode, probably use derived-mode-p.

Jun 23 22:21:18 <jmarciano>	that works

Jun 23 22:21:32 <wasamasa>	depending on what it is, the procedure is different
Jun 23 22:22:23 <jmarciano>	I see, this is good enough for purpose to set the key upon message mode to message-kill-to-signature

I typically get the string to put inside the (kbd) call from doing C-h c, hitting the key(s) I want to bind, and then seeing how they're printed in the minibuffer.

Jun 24 10:27:04 <kqr>	to avoid the risk of running down an XY rabbit hole: I really dislike having the point butt up against the edges of the window. the only solution I have at the moment that will let me avoid that situation when point is at the beginning of a buffer, is to automatically insert a bunch of whitespace lines at the beginning of buffers. this is not a very nice solution when coopering with others.

Jun 24 10:27:57 <kqr>	sort of before-save-hook that cleans this up, but before I dig too deeply into that: does anyone know of any other solution to this? e.g. having an empty region that is displayed at the top of the buffer, but not actually part of the contents that will be saved, or somesuch?

Jun 24 10:31:49 <kqr>	are both of those not active all the time, even when point is not at bob?
Jun 24 10:32:06 <bpalmer>	yes, that's true.
Jun 24 10:32:17 <bpalmer>	but presumably you don't need to be looking where point isn't.
Jun 24 10:33:01 <kqr>	but if I want point centered at all times, I'd need a header line that occupies 50% of the frame, which is not ideal.
Jun 24 10:33:28 <kqr>	(I get that it's an unreasonable/unusual request, and I'm not going to pursue it very far, but it would be nice if there was a simple way to get it done anyway.)
Jun 24 10:36:37 <bpalmer>	I don't know of any. I suppose you could insert an overlay that has a :display property of, e.g., 500 space characters
Jun 24 10:37:09 <bpalmer>	since overlays aren't written out when saved (barring special work), it'll just disappear; and they're inherently bound to location in a way that text properties aren't.
Jun 24 10:38:43 <kqr>	that's what I'm currently looking into. will try a few things out and if I don't get it to work I'll drop it. :) thanks for indicating I might be on the right track
Jun 24 10:39:01 <bpalmer>	oh, display supports indication of height and width
Jun 24 10:39:10 <kqr>	yes
Jun 24 10:40:28 <bpalmer>	What I was starting to mess with was (defvar top-of-text-overlay (let ((o (make-overlay (point-min) (point-min)))) (overlay-put o 'display (make-string 100 ?\ )) o))
Jun 24 10:40:50 <bpalmer>	but clearly directly specifying width and height would be better. Or insert a friendly smiling clown image, or whatever.

Jun 24 12:27:03 <roelj>	blandest: Well, how do I do M-x? It seems to get ignored.
Jun 24 12:27:03 <blandest>	It looks like it's only a prefix but maybe you have it bound to something

Jun 24 12:27:27 <blandest>	roelj: switch to line-mode first
Jun 24 12:27:50 <blandest>	in the mode line you should have something like: Term: char run
Jun 24 12:28:01 <roelj>	C-c C-j and C-c C-k are both undefined
Jun 24 12:28:26 <blandest>	then that's pretty strange
Jun 24 12:28:27 <roelj>	In the modeline it says (Term: char run)
Jun 24 12:28:38 <blandest>	click on "char" to switch to line mode
Jun 24 12:28:48 <blandest>	mouse click that is
Jun 24 12:28:49 <roelj>	That worked
Jun 24 12:29:02 <blandest>	so now you should be able to type M-x
Jun 24 12:29:18 <blandest>	M-x works in line mode only

Jun 24 12:29:25 <roelj>	Thanks :)
Jun 24 12:30:02 <roelj>	Unfortunately, when I do: "M-x describe-key [RET] C-c", it waits for another key input
Jun 24 12:30:15 *	dancn has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Jun 24 12:30:16 <roelj>	meaning.. nothing binds to "C-c" only? 
Jun 24 12:32:00 <roelj>	It seems that when I enter "char" mode, my keybindings stop working.  When I enter "line" mode, C-c C-k changes to "char" mode.  But once in "char" mode, I can't do C-c C-j to get into "line" mode.

Jun 24 12:34:12 <blandest>	if it waits for input it means that C-c is not bound to anything, rather it's a prefix for a longer key sequence

Jun 27 12:46:17 <jmarciano>	is there any way to find which function is currently running from inside of the function? So that I can log some actions.
Jun 27 12:47:41 <enikar>	in which language ?
Jun 27 12:47:47 <jmarciano>	emacs lisp
Jun 27 12:49:09 <enikar>	you can always see the source of a function : type C-h f RET function-name RET
Jun 27 12:49:55 <npostavs>	jmarciano: you mean while running?  backtrace-frame might help
Jun 27 12:49:58 <jmarciano>	This yes. But within function like (defun example () (current-function)) something like this is impossible?
Jun 27 12:50:12 <enikar>	the source is easily open from the help buffer.
Jun 27 12:51:12 <jmarciano>	I see that can work backtrace-frame
Jun 27 12:51:17 <jmarciano>	excellent, thanks
Jun 27 12:52:07 <jmarciano>	it just requires to know the frame number...
Jun 27 12:53:29 <npostavs>	jmarciano: I think in your case the number should always be 1 (it counts up the call stack)

Jun 27 13:04:25 <npostavs>	jmarciano: the calling function would be 2, no?
Jun 27 13:06:55 <jmarciano>	now it just looks within the function itself. Not within the upper function
Jun 27 13:07:12 <jmarciano>	OK I will just send function symbol as argument to logging function. Solved.

Jun 27 15:00:03 <TDT>	So....kinda random question.  For using emacs on a remote machine, is there a good way to use something like emacsclient to connect to a remote instance of emacs but have the GUI more local?
Jun 27 15:00:27 <TDT>	I'm thinking of that instead of doing passing SSH with X and running emacs or emacsclient that way

Jun 27 15:02:25 <TDT>	I was thinking that, but can that work with straight up connections and accessing all the buffers already loaded?
Jun 27 15:02:53 <TDT>	Reason I worry about TRAMP is that I've only used it for editing files remotely.  But if I have file A open on my workstation, then try to edit the same file, then something can be overwritten
Jun 27 15:03:01 <TDT>	I'm thinking primarily for org mode that I want to do this for.

Jun 27 15:04:43 <offby1>	if you're using ssh (as opposed to mosh) to connect to the remote emacs, I have a hair-raisingly ugly kludge that will more or less let the remote emacs put stuff onto the local clipboard.
Jun 27 15:04:56 <offby1>	You will need industrial eye protection to look at the code though
Jun 27 15:05:04 <loskutak>	lol
Jun 27 15:05:51 <offby1>	in theory you can run your remote Emacs in gui mode, and have it display on a local X server.  That's a) a pain in the ass to set up if your local box is a Mac (as mine is), and b) dog-slow
Jun 27 15:06:28 <offby1>	man, I remember when the whole idea of X was exciting.  Display stuff remotely!
Jun 27 15:06:32 <offby1>	we were dumb then
Jun 27 15:07:07 <z0d>	no, technology was different back then
Jun 27 15:07:36 <z0d>	I really hope that we'll ditch X at some point for some modern stuff

Jun 28 13:43:27 <raph_ael>	is there any way to have eshell standalone ? ie outside emacs (just for fun)
Jun 28 13:56:16 <hodapp>	hmmm, I don't think so, as it's pretty tied in with Emacs
Jun 28 14:15:27 <raph_ael>	hodapp: thanks I was thinking it might be like that too, but who knows
Jun 28 14:20:11 <hodapp>	you could probably starts emacs in such a manner to drop you right into eshell
Jun 28 14:21:18 <enikar>	it'll be an heavy shell start :D
Jun 28 14:21:50 <parsnip>	emacs -Q -f eshell

Jun 28 14:31:20 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some days, the sun rises, and you look upon your works and despair
Jun 28 14:31:36 <rudybot>	bpalmer: "In Portuguese, norte-americano is the most commonly used term. Estadunidense is gaining some popularity, specifically in Brazil, where its usage traditionally rises during times of tension with the USA."
Jun 28 15:14:33 <Illya>	those of you who use projectile, how can I bury all old project buffers on switching project? I essentially just want my buffer states to be saved when I switch around projects
Jun 28 15:15:09 <Illya>	maybe I'm thinking of it as a full context switch when it shouldn't really be used like that
Jun 28 15:15:38 <pointsman>	Building master the build is somewhat clittered with warnings:
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	lisp.h:413:38: warning: potential null pointer dereference [-Wnull-dereference]
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	 #define lisp_h_XCAR(c) XCONS (c)->u.s.car
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	lisp.h:1406:10: note: in expansion of macro ‘lisp_h_XCAR’
Jun 28 15:15:40 <pointsman>	   return lisp_h_XCAR (c);
Jun 28 15:16:22 <pointsman>	Too sad, after Lars cleaned up so nicely all that noisy build warnings.
Jun 28 15:16:47 <pointsman>	This is with gcc 6.3.0.
Jun 28 15:17:26 <pointsman>	Is that known?
Jun 28 15:17:53 <klostein>	lars worked on the elisp bits
Jun 28 15:18:59 <dada_cetacean>	hey folks, i'd like to define a custom user command for switching to a particular theme. how do i find the elisp i need to execute for this? (i only know how to use `customize-theme`)
Jun 28 15:24:30 <Illya>	(load-theme "name" t nil) ?
Jun 28 15:28:21 <dada_cetacean>	Illya: oh that even has an interactive mode which does exactly wha ti want
Jun 28 15:28:23 <dada_cetacean>	thanks!
Jun 28 15:29:23 <dada_cetacean>	second question: how do i ensure that an org-mode code block does not insert the output beneath the code block after execution?
Jun 28 15:35:00 <dada_cetacean>	also, how do i ensure that when using `load-theme`, all over active themes are disabled?
Jun 28 15:38:54 <npostavs>	pointsman: I think that's a known bug, it sounds familiar
Jun 28 15:39:48 <npostavs>	pointsman: ,,bug 32444,, Lars says "it's not present with a newer gcc"
Jun 28 15:39:49 <fsbot>	https://debbugs.gnu.org/32444
Jun 28 15:41:12 <tromey>	for older gcc you probably want to just disable warnings
Jun 28 15:49:45 <pointsman>	OK; thanks.
Jun 28 15:57:04 <raph_ael>	parsnip: fun thanks
Jun 28 16:11:42 <mns>	I have a ~/.emacs.d/elisp directory, which has sub-directories, one for each package I want to use.  I can not use use-package (build machines behind firewalls with no access to outside world).  What I want to do is process the ~/.emacs.d/elisp/*/*-autloads.el files.  How would I do that without explicitly stating each package ? 
Jun 28 16:38:07 <JordiGH>	So, how easy are memory leaks in Rust?
Jun 28 16:38:21 <JordiGH>	Not necessarily literal memory leaks that valgrind would find.
Jun 28 16:39:25 <bpalmer>	pretty easy. Make something that doesn't autodispose of itself.
Jun 28 16:40:07 <tromey>	I think in the Rust model a leak is not considered a memory safety violation
Jun 28 16:40:19 <tromey>	however in normal code it's difficult to leak
Jun 28 16:40:23 <bpalmer>	https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/leaking.html
Jun 28 16:40:38 <bpalmer>	I forgot about mem::forget
Jun 28 16:41:03 <tromey>	Java had some terminology for the ways to leak that don't look like leaking
Jun 28 16:41:12 <tromey>	like if you have data that is unused but can't be collected
Jun 28 16:41:21 <tromey>	loiterers and lingerers, something like that
Jun 28 16:41:35 <tromey>	Rust, and really no language afaik, prevents that kind of thing
Jun 28 16:42:03 <JordiGH>	I bet we could rephrase leaks as a stopping problem.
Jun 28 16:42:11 <bpalmer>	sure.
Jun 28 16:42:27 <bpalmer>	a = new int(); f(); delete a;   <-- a is only deleted if f terminates
Jun 28 16:44:32 <bpalmer>	At any rate.
Jun 28 16:46:30 <edgar-rft>	All sorts of infinite loops cause memory leaks because the memory won't get freed until the end of the univese.
Jun 28 16:46:59 <bpalmer>	we'd better end the universe soon so we can reclaim our resources.
Jun 28 16:48:20 <edgar-rft>	the more difficult question is if it's a *real* memory leak when the memory *gets* freed at the end of the universe
Jun 28 16:50:36 <edgar-rft>	(when (end-of-universe-p) (garbage-collect))
Jun 28 16:50:43 <bpalmer>	you know what they say about equivalence of energy and memory.
Jun 28 16:51:22 <bpalmer>	I'm too tired to remember all the details, though.
Jun 28 16:52:35 <edgar-rft>	yes, you already forgot about mem::forget, that's enough for today
Jun 28 16:52:46 <fledermaus>	Just scribble a note in the margin.
Jun 28 16:52:50 <fledermaus>	it'll be fine.
Jun 28 16:53:33 <edgar-rft>	energy drinks can help to increase your memory
Jun 28 16:54:08 <tromey>	that's why I drink battery juice
Jun 28 16:54:34 <gnomon>	I always look into this channel at the weirdest times
Jun 28 16:54:45 <JordiGH>	It's edgar-rft's fault it got weird.
Jun 28 16:54:48 <JordiGH>	I keep it normal.
Jun 28 16:55:01 <JordiGH>	So, about that git program that's gotten popular these days...
Jun 28 16:55:11 <JordiGH>	Do you think it will really catch on?
Jun 28 16:55:16 <JordiGH>	Seems like a fad to me.
Jun 28 16:55:18 <tromey>	too soon to tell
Jun 28 16:55:34 <bpalmer>	by the end of the universe we might know.
Jun 28 16:55:35 <tromey>	I was assigned to work on gcj in the cygnus days and I was unhappy because java was a fad
Jun 28 16:55:57 <bpalmer>	java's success was a black swan event, to be sure.
Jun 28 16:56:05 <JordiGH>	tromey: I saw your name on some autotools-generated Makefile the other day and was like, huh, dude sure got around.
Jun 28 16:56:23 <edgar-rft>	The next question is, if energy and memory are equivalent, than how much memory is in a bottle of energy?
Jun 28 16:56:24 <tromey>	yes, I mainly wrote automake
Jun 28 16:56:38 <tromey>	well back in the day, it's been rewritten a lot I think
Jun 28 16:56:42 <JordiGH>	edgar-rft: Been playing cuphead?
Jun 28 16:58:31 <JordiGH>	tromey: gcj was a fad, though.
Jun 28 16:58:37 <JordiGH>	,libation
Jun 28 16:58:37 *	fsbot pours one out for those we have lost.
Jun 28 16:58:39 <tromey>	sadly
Jun 28 16:58:45 <edgar-rft>	Wikipedia says: First announced in 2014, the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in September 2017, for macOS in October 2018, and for Nintendo Switch in April 2019. Hmm, I own none of them, that's why I never played cuphead.
Jun 28 16:58:45 <tromey>	ah well
Jun 28 16:58:58 <JordiGH>	edgar-rft: Well, they have cups for heads.
Jun 28 16:59:07 <JordiGH>	So, I guess you could drink their memories.
Jun 28 16:59:38 <edgar-rft>	Aah, nice idea :-)
Jun 28 17:33:54 <johnjay>	indeed
Jun 28 17:34:53 <kenrestivo>	or you could drink the blood of children, like peter thiel
Jun 28 17:34:54 <johnjay>	melpa has 0 packages?
Jun 28 17:34:55 <johnjay>	eh
Jun 28 17:35:16 <johnjay>	oh there we go
Jun 28 17:35:20 <JordiGH>	kenrestivo: Don't be silly, he doesn't drink it. He takes it intravenously.
Jun 28 17:35:32 <kenrestivo>	ah, thanks for the clarification
Jun 28 17:37:10 <johnjay>	argh shoot i can't remember that emacs mode someone showed me
Jun 28 17:37:18 <johnjay>	the one where it colors the columns different colors
Jun 28 17:37:51 <kenrestivo>	columns? like csv-mode?
Jun 28 17:38:12 <twrk>	I guess like lolcat, but more vertical
Jun 28 17:38:13 <johnjay>	idk it's in source code and it will paint different grey colors on the columns for indentation
Jun 28 17:38:22 <johnjay>	it was highlight color something
Jun 28 17:38:27 <kenrestivo>	oh, yeah, i use that for idiotic languages like python and yaml
Jun 28 17:38:35 <kenrestivo>	h-i-g mode?
Jun 28 17:38:45 <twrk>	just tried highlight-indentation-(tab)
Jun 28 17:38:59 <twrk>	highlight-indentation-current-column-mode ?
Jun 28 17:39:08 <kenrestivo>	Highlight-Indent-Guides minor mode (indicator h-i-g):
Jun 28 17:39:27 <kenrestivo>	has saved my ass multiple times
Jun 28 17:39:43 <johnjay>	that's close to what i want
Jun 28 17:39:49 <johnjay>	but it's not using a different sh ade for each column
Jun 28 17:40:00 <johnjay>	i think maybe it's alternating?
Jun 28 17:40:08 <kenrestivo>	it's a very slightly alternating shade on mine
Jun 28 17:40:16 <kenrestivo>	gray and light gray?
Jun 28 17:40:25 <johnjay>	yes
Jun 28 17:40:31 <johnjay>	i wanted something like dark grey light grey grey lighter grey
Jun 28 17:40:40 <kenrestivo>	customize?
Jun 28 17:40:40 <fsbot>	From memory, Customize is [0] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Customize
Jun 28 17:40:40 <fsbot>	[1] a built in command to setup emacs to your liking in an easy way available through M-x customize RET
Jun 28 17:41:01 <twrk>	anyway, TAGS are great, but they cover a lot of ground and you have to append from several different places... is there a simpler way to get automatic code navigation like in visual studio? basically some tool to see a source file in a "project" directory, and then create all the references for jumping to definitions
Jun 28 17:41:30 <twrk>	...company-mode? :/ idk
Jun 28 17:42:00 *	kenrestivo smacks the bad gateway over the nose with a rolled-up newspaper
Jun 28 17:42:18 <kenrestivo>	god that analogy is old. who even has newspapers anymore
Jun 28 17:42:47 <twrk>	smack noses with e-readers
Jun 28 17:43:21 <johnjay>	hmm well it's built in to alternate odd and even columns
Jun 28 17:43:30 <johnjay>	i'd have to tweak the code a bit, not sure it's worth it
Jun 28 17:43:33 <johnjay>	this might be the 80% solution
Jun 28 17:46:40 <johnjay>	what's the best emacsy way to temporarily format some text in the region?
Jun 28 17:46:52 <johnjay>	narrow the buffer or create a new temp buffer and pop to that and then do stuff?
Jun 28 17:47:48 <JordiGH>	I usually narrow.
Jun 28 17:48:20 <johnjay>	ah with-help-window looks good
Jun 28 17:48:23 <sg2002>	twrk: Well creating projects is not simpler by any means. Anyway, ggtags mode is pretty good. For simple usecases you just run gtags in your root directory and here's your "project"
Jun 28 17:48:41 <twrk>	ok, I try
Jun 28 17:48:58 <sg2002>	twrk: There's also projectile and that has some kind of tags intergration, if you really want project-based workflow.
Jun 28 17:49:07 <johnjay>	with-temp-buffer looks pretty hairy
Jun 28 17:49:13 <johnjay>	how does it enable hitting 'q' to quit the window?
Jun 28 17:54:01 <twrk>	defining the key in the mode map
Jun 28 17:54:10 <johnjay>	oh
Jun 28 17:54:45 <twrk>	(looking at buff-menu as an example, buff-menu.el, from doing C-x C-b)
Jun 28 17:59:15 <noonker>	Is anyone here using emacs-slack? I'm having an issue where if I'm visiting a remote file with tramp the slack websocket tries to use my tramp connection. Curious if anyone's seen that before and had a solution. 
Jun 28 18:00:19 <technomancy>	noonker: I didn't run into that particular problem but I did find just a lot of instability overall
Jun 28 18:00:51 <noonker>	I've honestly been having pretty good luck with it- hell even this works it just slows things WAY down.

Jul 11 01:08:23 <hodapp>	Now let's get a volunteer from the audience to come up here.
Jul 11 01:08:35 *	hodapp very obviously picks fjmng "at random" intentionally
Jul 11 01:08:40 <hodapp>	You, sir! Come up here!

Jul 11 01:08:56 *	rwp remembers "vigor".  It was a clippy mode satirically written for vi back in the day...
Jul 11 01:08:57 <fjmng>	o-ok sir
Jul 11 01:09:02 <hodapp>	Don't be shy, now! I won't tell your wife about all the attention I see the ladies giving you.
Jul 11 01:09:13 <fjmng>	h-ha ha
Jul 11 01:09:30 <hodapp>	Alright, now let's do a little experiment. Give me your wallet for a moment.
Jul 11 01:09:31 <iqubic>	Is there a way to compare two branches in the same git repo?
Jul 11 01:09:42 <fjmng>	Ok
Jul 11 01:10:16 <hodapp>	Okay, thank you sir! Now, I have to go get something, but I'll be right back.
Jul 11 01:10:18 *	hodapp doesn't return
Jul 11 01:10:52 <npostavs>	iqubic: you're saying that as if there is a way to compare two branches in different git repos.
Jul 11 01:11:34 <fjmng>	Um
Jul 11 01:11:36 <fjmng>	Hello?
Jul 11 01:11:37 <fsbot>	Здравствуйте fjmng!
Jul 11 01:11:51 <fjmng>	Its getting kind of late...
Jul 11 01:11:54 <parsnip>	rudybot: where are my parents!
Jul 11 01:11:56 <rudybot>	parsnip: Even wikipedia's article about the serial comma is stupid. They use the example of "To my parents, Ayn Rand, and God." as being ambiguous because it's unclear where it's three chunks, or if Ayn Rand and God are parents. It's unambiguoulsy three separate items because a colon should be used if Ayn Rand and God were parents, i.e. "To my parents: ..."
Jul 11 01:11:57 <fjmng>	all the people are gone...

Jul 11 01:15:25 <fjmng>	hmmmm
Jul 11 01:15:31 <fjmng>	maybe kenzo is a scammer...
Jul 11 01:25:11 <michaelrose>	so what is the optimal way to run a shell command from inside emacs that expects interactive input?
Jul 11 01:27:33 <butterthebuddha>	michaelrose: eshell is an option, though idk about optimal
Jul 11 01:27:56 <michaelrose>	specifically I was trying to use cargo run or the function from rustic that wraps cargo run to run a function that prompts for input while going through a tutorial book "the rust programming language" simply running the shell command or the function ends up outputting some text to a buffer but isn't designed to actually take input
Jul 11 01:28:16 <butterthebuddha>	michaelrose: there is a cargo package for emcs
Jul 11 01:28:24 <butterthebuddha>	Nvm
Jul 11 01:28:33 <butterthebuddha>	I'd use ehsell or ansi-term for that
Jul 11 01:28:54 <fjmng>	Just use C, the master language
Jul 11 01:29:05 <michaelrose>	fjmng, that really isn't a useful answer
Jul 11 01:29:12 <fjmng>	Yes it is
Jul 11 01:29:27 <technomancy>	it's useful if you need to update your /ignore list
Jul 11 01:29:45 <fjmng>	heh
Jul 11 01:38:26 <parsnip>	wow, china, cuba, and iran cannot download paid apps from android play store
Jul 11 01:38:27 <michaelrose>	well running async-shell-command actually allows input so that is interesting

Jul 11 09:03:32 <dminuoso>	Hi. Ive been using emacs (using spacemacs) for a while now, and I've not exactly grown comfortable with it, mostly because frequently "things dont work" and I dont understand why enough. Sometimes I press some keys and emacs hangs for a second or two for no reason that is obvious to me.
Jul 11 09:03:49 <loke>	dmiFirst step: Don't use spacemacs
Jul 11 09:03:53 <parsnip>	❝Allowing different localized number formats in the same file is one of the major reasons I chose hledger over ledger. Allowing them to be different across the same commodity is madness, but having different commodities each with their own respective proper formats is perfectly normal.❞
Jul 11 09:04:20 <dminuoso>	loke: That seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?
Jul 11 09:04:53 <dminuoso>	Im mostly wondering how one could approach emacs in a fashion to allow discoverability of "how do I XYZ"
Jul 11 09:04:55 <parsnip>	❝Interesting. Why wouldn't you just use the standard followed in your locale?  For instance, even when I enter a foreign currency transaction (in say, EUR), I still write € 10,000.00 instead of 10.000,00 €.❞
Jul 11 09:05:09 <parsnip>	"What is 'my locale'?"
Jul 11 09:05:12 <parsnip>	i love this stuff
Jul 11 09:05:43 <parsnip>	dminuoso: we really can't help much with troubleshooting spacemacs
Jul 11 09:05:55 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Oh I think my problems are more emacs related than spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:06:41 <parsnip>	dminuoso: there's very straightforward ways to troubleshoot things in emacs, and you are missing out on those in spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:07:17 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Oh? Mind my asking what those are? If there's arguments in favor for using emacs over spacemacs I'm game.
Jul 11 09:07:58 <parsnip>	i just made an argument
Jul 11 09:08:30 <dminuoso>	Am I not allowed to ask what those "straightforward ways" even are? :p
Jul 11 09:09:01 <parsnip>	so you want me to philosophize about a potential debugging problem in a way that _won't_ work for you?
Jul 11 09:09:19 <parsnip>	please see ,,spacemacs 2 2,,
Jul 11 09:09:19 <fsbot>	I think spacemacs is support is available at https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs .. + other notes
Jul 11 09:09:48 <michaelrose>	With standard emacs you start out with a stable base that is extremely likely to not be busted. You can then add functions as you need them and observe the result. If the result is obvious brokeness you can disable what you just added and be back to a stable base
Jul 11 09:09:55 <parsnip>	it's late here, i'm not in the mood to philoshiphize
Jul 11 09:09:59 <twb>	Wow cool what was tar doing when seccomp stopped it
Jul 11 09:10:02 <dminuoso>	parsnip: I think you misunderstand. My question is "What does emacs have in that regard that spacemacs doesnt?"
Jul 11 09:10:20 <twb>	"tar xf -" doesn't tell me much.  I suspect it's building the postfix chroot
Jul 11 09:10:30 <twb>	dminuoso: honor
Jul 11 09:10:44 <parsnip>	dminuoso: emacs does not have a huge gap between "does it occur in emacs -Q", and, "try bisecting your config".
Jul 11 09:10:57 <parsnip>	that's it
Jul 11 09:11:01 <michaelrose>	dminuoso, spacemacs is a massive pile of packages with a lower standard of care than base emacs
Jul 11 09:11:27 <parsnip>	michaelrose: colon is the convention on irc
Jul 11 09:11:28 <twb>	More seriously, what GNU Emacs has that spacemacs lacks is... support.
Jul 11 09:12:40 <parsnip>	twb: but someone made emacs shiny for me
Jul 11 09:13:04 <parsnip>	by slapping together, _already existing packages_
Jul 11 09:13:25 <parsnip>	it still kills me that they associate themselves with vim and "a distro"
Jul 11 09:13:39 <twb>	parsnip: spacevm?
Jul 11 09:14:02 <parsnip>	twb: no, spacemacs represent themselves as if they wrote evil-mode.el
Jul 11 09:14:46 <dminuoso>	parsnip: For what its worth, it was the seemingly easy way to "get something pretty while maintaining vi layout" that attracted me to spacemacs.
Jul 11 09:14:58 <dminuoso>	It took me a while too to realize that evil is not a spacemacs thing..
Jul 11 09:15:05 <michaelrose>	dminuoso: it appears that you yourself have made the argument against spacemacs for everyone already. You say your experience with it is buggy and troublesome
Jul 11 09:15:13 <dminuoso>	michaelrose: Heh.
Jul 11 09:15:21 <dminuoso>	I take your point.
Jul 11 09:21:11 <knobo1>	Can I use different type of indexing for different type of projectile projects?
Jul 11 09:22:02 <knobo1>	I want to register my own type of project that uses native indexing method.
Jul 11 09:22:19 <knobo1>	And use alien on all other projects.
Jul 11 09:45:50 <krux02>	knobo1, i have no idea what you want
Jul 11 10:13:38 <parsnip>	what is this?
Jul 11 10:13:40 <parsnip>	(y) (y)
Jul 11 10:15:35 <twb>	parsnip: are those nipple rings?
Jul 11 10:18:06 <parsnip>	idk, can't find it here: http://kaomoji.ru/en/
Jul 11 10:19:37 <z0d>	parsnip: looks like a malformed lambda expression :-> 
Jul 11 10:22:13 <parsnip>	this is the same guy as when i didn't understand their github emoji
Jul 11 10:23:12 <ski>	rudybot: Is this some new form of inscrutable emojibake?
Jul 11 10:23:22 <rudybot>	ski: i actually get annoyed with emacs lisp's weird inscrutable things. for me they include that, apply-partially, the new advice system for no real reason, and the elimination of a form dedicated to dynamic let.
Jul 11 10:26:56 <parsnip>	emoji seem to be the solution to the problem that Kaomoji created
Jul 11 10:28:45 <twb>	parsnip: you know emoji first started on docomo / ntt phone network, right
Jul 11 10:29:05 <parsnip>	sort of yes
Jul 11 10:29:13 <parsnip>	vaguely recall
Jul 11 10:34:38 <dminuoso>	parsnip: Okay so an hour of emacs makes me a bit angry. Things just work. :<
Jul 11 10:34:51 <dminuoso>	spacemacs should come with a big sign that says "Here be dragons and bugs"
Jul 11 10:35:05 <parsnip>	dminuoso: were you on master or develop?
Jul 11 10:35:16 <dminuoso>	master
Jul 11 10:35:24 <twb>	dminuoso: doesn't spacemacs have nyancat on by default
Jul 11 10:35:38 <parsnip>	dminuoso: i think master is deprecated
Jul 11 10:35:39 <twb>	That would be a bit of a giveaway
Jul 11 10:35:58 <parsnip>	dminuoso: but anyways, easier for people here if you use emacs.
Jul 11 10:36:13 <twb>	parsnip: wait... people check out un-tagged git commit and expect it to wok?
Jul 11 10:37:17 <dminuoso>	Im slowly realizing that spacemacs is really overkill. Any package you want, you can still load from melpa..
Jul 11 10:37:46 <dminuoso>	And perhaps it forces me to understand what Im doing more, rather than emacs automatically fetching things and configuring things when I open a file.
Jul 11 10:43:03 <parsnip>	lol, the matrix users are using @ now
Jul 11 10:43:54 <parsnip>	"i remember when this was an irc channel"
Jul 11 10:44:40 <twb>	dminuoso: truly, there are many lawns for those damn kids to get off of.
Jul 11 10:45:31 <twb>	When is pNFS useful?
Jul 11 10:53:56 <hortiel>	hi
Jul 11 10:54:11 <hortiel>	how do i repeatedly paste a sentence 7 times in emacs , using repeating cmd
Jul 11 10:54:21 <hortiel>	I tried but for some reason it works only for one letter
Jul 11 10:56:17 <parsnip>	i just press paste 7 times
Jul 11 10:56:23 <parsnip>	or record a keyboard macro
Jul 11 10:56:55 <parsnip>	why one letter? what method are you using to copy?
Jul 11 10:57:56 <hortiel>	i don't know macro at this stage. I use C-u
Jul 11 10:58:51 <hortiel>	C-y I need to press it 7 times. but i don't want to
Jul 11 10:59:16 <hortiel>	let's say it 70 times, can't be don't I used C-u 70 C-y ; didn't work??
Jul 11 10:59:16 <fsbot>	Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
Jul 11 10:59:35 <hortiel>	C-u repeats it, but in this case it's not repeating ... annoying.
Jul 11 10:59:52 <hortiel>	parsnip: what do you mean you just press paste 70 times.
Jul 11 11:00:08 <parsnip>	oh, i missed the line with 70
Jul 11 11:00:16 <parsnip>	oh, reading
Jul 11 11:00:52 <hortiel>	...
Jul 11 11:01:50 <parsnip>	maybe C-u 70 C-y
Jul 11 11:04:09 <parsnip>	you can also use C-u 70 with keyboard macros
Jul 11 11:04:41 <parsnip>	so like <f3> C-y <f4> C-u 70 <f4>
Jul 11 11:06:00 <parsnip>	and maybe C-y C-u 70 C-x z works. but <f3/4> seem more robust
Jul 11 11:06:40 <parsnip>	becasue what if C-y ate C-u 70 as some argument?
Jul 11 11:06:43 <parsnip>	*because
Jul 11 11:08:43 <hortiel>	but clearly C-u 70 command ; takes command as the argument, and repeats it 70 times, why not this one. 
Jul 11 11:09:03 <hortiel>	C-u 70 i ; this writes i 70 times
Jul 11 11:09:41 <parsnip>	hortiel: i offered <f3,4> since you might want to do less trivial things in the future.
Jul 11 11:10:09 <parsnip>	and i guess i was wondering myself what all ways there were to repeat stuff.
Jul 11 11:10:34 <parsnip>	i've never really needed C-u 70, but nice to know it works with <f3,4>, iiuc
Jul 11 11:11:05 <hortiel>	ok, what's a macro? why does it works that way. 
Jul 11 11:11:31 <hortiel>	I came to emacs last week, though, and intend to check out org mode, after i have done enriched mode.

Jul 11 15:56:01 <rpav>	why is there a huge delay in responsiveness when spawning a process
Jul 11 15:56:27 <rpav>	using async-shell-command
Jul 11 15:56:47 <rpav>	i can see a minor hitch as the fork and setup happens, but it's like, 5 seconds
Jul 11 15:56:57 <bremner>	don't see that here. OS? shell?
Jul 11 15:57:19 <rpav>	linux, x86_64, and i'm not sure what shell it spawns .. bash?
Jul 11 15:58:31 <rpav>	it doesn't *always* seem to happen, mostly when the shell in question is doing nontrivial work (in this case starting a build)
Jul 11 16:00:58 <bremner>	huh. Does the same build command do it consistently?
Jul 11 16:01:33 <bremner>	is it some fancy build tool like cmake? I tried make here and it seemed OK.
Jul 11 16:05:41 <rpav>	cmake just spits out makefiles
Jul 11 16:05:52 <rpav>	this is definitely once it's running make

Jul 11 19:20:26 <greenline>	M'Expressions
Jul 11 19:21:21 <johnjay>	Mexpressions is a nice restaurant name
Jul 11 19:21:51 <greenline>	Mexicali Express is a place that exists. Now I wonder if their menu is data.
Jul 11 19:24:29 <fledermaus>	there's a new place opening up that's on my route to work. casa maramureseana 
Jul 11 19:24:38 <fledermaus>	not sure they've thought that name through.
Jul 11 19:25:24 <fledermaus>	just cos people will find it hard to say/spell here 
Jul 11 19:26:19 <bremner>	globally it seems to be a popular resto name
Jul 11 19:26:23 <parsnip>	almost ten syllables
Jul 11 19:26:26 <fledermaus>	yeah, I just searched for it.
Jul 11 19:26:37 <fledermaus>	romanian cuisine, apparently.
Jul 11 19:27:13 <johnjay>	casa de wasa the masa
Jul 11 19:34:21 <johnjay>	wait everytime you open a file emacs searches up the entire directory tree for a .dir-locals.el file?
Jul 11 19:38:35 <kenrestivo>	that would explain a lot of slowness
Jul 11 19:38:43 <kenrestivo>	i.e. on ssh or fusermount or such
Jul 11 19:39:05 <tromey>	there's some caching and I think a special setting for tramp
Jul 11 19:39:15 <johnjay>	i created foo/bar/a.txt and foo/baz/b.txt in /tmp and when i opened b.txt it found the .dir-locals.el in foo
Jul 11 19:40:18 <kenrestivo>	i pity the foo
Jul 11 19:41:35 <Inline>	you emptied the bar too ?
Jul 11 19:41:38 <Inline>	lol
Jul 11 19:41:41 <kenrestivo>	lol
Jul 11 19:42:23 <johnjay>	honestly there's gotta be an elisp function that takes a list and creates a directory tree based on that list
Jul 11 19:42:58 <kenrestivo>	like, mkdir -p ?
Jul 11 19:43:20 <johnjay>	e.g. (foo (bar (a.txt)) (baz (b.txt)))
Jul 11 19:43:39 <johnjay>	kenrestivo: ah that's a good point
Jul 11 19:47:41 <JordiGH>	lol

Jul 11 19:52:21 <fsbot>	Added note [6] for term "lol"
Jul 11 19:54:22 <johnjay>	is there a function that returns a symbol's name, function slot, value, and plist all at once?
Jul 11 19:54:36 <tromey>	I don't think so
Jul 11 19:54:44 <johnjay>	oh well
Jul 11 19:58:05 <parsnip>	hmm, not getting notifations for issues filed at my baby
Jul 11 19:59:01 <parsnip>	ah, "Not watching"
Jul 11 19:59:18 <johnjay>	i'm imagining people filing issues on github for a newborn
Jul 11 19:59:22 *	johnjay decides to take a break
Jul 11 20:03:41 <parsnip>	is there a fancy name for "user" when described by free software foundation folks?
Jul 11 20:03:54 <parsnip>	i know they say a facebook user is a "used"
Jul 11 20:03:54 <wasamasa>	liberator
Jul 11 20:04:43 <parsnip>	haha, the user is liberating the code from the author?
Jul 11 20:05:36 <parsnip>	or is that just your favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?
Jul 11 20:08:54 <wasamasa>	that's just a joke
Jul 11 20:09:21 <wasamasa>	it's even funnier considering I took a deep dive into this library: https://github.com/clojure-liberator/liberator
Jul 11 20:14:58 <JordiGH>	Hm, now we need a good reason to name a library Erator.
Jul 11 20:15:50 <fledermaus>	https://duckduckgo.com/?q=blakes+7+liberator&t=ffab&iax=images&ia=images
Jul 11 20:16:15 <JordiGH>	Is that some fancy multi syringe?
Jul 11 20:16:22 <parsnip>	that's just a joke back!
Jul 11 20:16:26 <parsnip>	your face!
Jul 11 20:17:02 <fledermaus>	JordiGH: you don't recognise the ship leading the resistance against the evil federation?
Jul 11 20:17:43 <fledermaus>	(The joke was always that Star Trek was pro-federation propaganda and Blake's 7 was the dark, gritty truth of the resistance)
Jul 11 20:17:48 <JordiGH>	It's starting to look like some weapon against anti-vaxxers.
Jul 11 20:18:17 <JordiGH>	fledermaus: Son, I don't trek on stars.
Jul 11 20:18:49 <fledermaus>	MENTIROSO
Jul 11 20:19:57 <parsnip>	would it be rude to capitalize the issue title someone filed?
Jul 11 20:20:19 <JordiGH>	Edit mercilessly.
Jul 11 20:20:20 <parsnip>	"created file is hidden"
Jul 11 20:20:24 <parsnip>	ruthless
Jul 11 20:20:30 <parsnip>	have you no compassion
Jul 11 20:20:50 <parsnip>	f*** it, i did it
Jul 11 20:21:09 <parsnip>	ignored the rest of the bad grammar
Jul 11 20:21:26 <parsnip>	wait, should i edit the grammar there too?
Jul 11 20:21:50 <parsnip>	naw
Jul 11 20:21:52 <JordiGH>	I approve of syntax fascism.
Jul 11 20:21:58 <hortiel_>	C-x C-h says displays cmd that begin with C-x, but when I search for the meta cmd using C-h k and then typing the using it says that key sequence is not defined!!
Jul 11 20:22:07 <hortiel_>	but clearly C-x C-h is defined
Jul 11 20:22:19 <JordiGH>	C-h is kind of special.
Jul 11 20:22:23 <JordiGH>	It's the help key.
Jul 11 20:22:28 <hortiel_>	yes
Jul 11 20:22:32 <JordiGH>	C-x C-h isn't defined; C-h is.
Jul 11 20:22:52 <JordiGH>	C-h interrupts a prefix to tell you what keys have this prefix.
Jul 11 20:23:13 <hortiel_>	M-x C-h doesn't work that way though? why not
Jul 11 20:23:22 <JordiGH>	M-x isn't a prefix.
Jul 11 20:24:07 <JordiGH>	That is a single key bound to run-command or something.
Jul 11 20:24:28 <hortiel_>	thx. 
Jul 11 20:25:18 <hortiel_>	and one more thing, I erased my .emacs* files , so lost the coloring and do you find white too bad, especially when selecting text, it barely displays the select text in a different shade.
Jul 11 20:25:56 <hortiel_>	I set set-background-color to black but lose my changes upon reboot 
Jul 11 20:27:08 <JordiGH>	Hm, are you using Emacs on a terminal? The default colours should have enough contrast
Jul 11 20:27:12 <hortiel_>	gui 
Jul 11 20:27:37 <hortiel_>	but can i make custom changes to my colors
Jul 11 20:27:41 <JordiGH>	Anyway, you need a init.el or .emacs to save your colours; if that's gone, no colours when you restart Emacs.
Jul 11 20:27:42 <hortiel_>	they don't persist
Jul 11 20:27:53 <JordiGH>	I've heard of this not persisting problem before with Spacemacs.
Jul 11 20:27:56 <JordiGH>	Are you using Spacemacs?
Jul 11 20:28:09 <hortiel_>	gnuemacs
Jul 11 20:28:28 <JordiGH>	Do you see changes to your .emacs or init.el?
Jul 11 20:28:34 <hortiel_>	nope
Jul 11 20:28:40 <JordiGH>	How are you setting them?
Jul 11 20:28:55 <hortiel_>	don't
Jul 11 20:29:06 <JordiGH>	You... are not changing the colours at all?
Jul 11 20:29:26 <hortiel_>	I am using M-x set-background-color black
Jul 11 20:30:31 <JordiGH>	Well, put (set-background-colour 'black) in your .emacs
Jul 11 20:30:34 <kenrestivo>	hmm, i used (set-frame-parameter item 'background-color "black")
Jul 11 20:30:37 <JordiGH>	Or maybe "black"
Jul 11 20:30:53 <kenrestivo>	walking thru (frame-list), that is
Jul 11 20:31:18 <JordiGH>	Why walk through it?
Jul 11 20:31:24 <JordiGH>	Just use the same function.
Jul 11 20:31:29 <kenrestivo>	because running would be too fast
Jul 11 20:31:47 <JordiGH>	Oh, comedy.
Jul 11 20:32:00 <kenrestivo>	i suspect i wrote my .emacs before set-background-color was a function
Jul 11 20:32:44 <JordiGH>	Hello fellow Ancient One; I too call it .emacs instead of init.el
Jul 11 20:32:46 <hortiel_>	earlier I didn't write any code in any config file, how did it persist.?
Jul 11 20:32:49 <parsnip>	but now little set-background-color is all grown up
Jul 11 20:32:53 <hortiel_>	don't remember what I did 
Jul 11 20:32:58 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Maybe you used M-x customize-face
Jul 11 20:33:23 <parsnip>	shouldn't this show verion percentages? https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
Jul 11 20:35:51 <hortiel_>	yes, I used in the menu though. customize theme not face as theme applies to background 
Jul 11 20:36:58 <hortiel_>	hey what's the other way to set-xxx without write code in config file?
Jul 11 20:39:48 <kenrestivo>	i thank you all very much for pointing me to themes. much better than the custom face crap i had in there before
Jul 11 20:40:13 <hortiel_>	kenrestivo: I was the one who uses themes. 
Jul 11 20:40:46 <hortiel_>	if one uses , enriched mode, does set-xxx persist?
Jul 11 20:41:09 <hortiel_>	I just wanto first try set-xxx without writing code??
Jul 11 20:41:10 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Jul 11 20:42:46 <JordiGH>	"without writing code", Emacs might not be for you.
Jul 11 20:42:56 <JordiGH>	http://notinventedhe.re/on/2010-1-20
Jul 11 20:44:32 <JordiGH>	The customize option from the menu just writes the code for you.
Jul 11 20:47:08 <JordiGH>	Maybe one of these days I should figure out how to use themes.
Jul 11 20:47:28 <JordiGH>	This still works for me: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/file/@/dotemacs.el#l479
Jul 11 20:48:08 <kenrestivo>	so, if i'm using themes, how would i still customze the font sizes?
Jul 11 20:49:45 <bremner>	hortiel_: I suspect very few people here use enriched-mode
Jul 11 20:52:29 <hortiel_>	why not
Jul 11 20:52:52 <hortiel_>	enriched mode is like the very beginning of it. at least for beginners like me.
Jul 11 20:52:56 <bremner>	the format it edits is not consumed by anything else that I am aware of
Jul 11 20:53:03 <hortiel_>	wat
Jul 11 20:53:35 <hortiel_>	then which they use? org mode? enriched mode is much simpler to understand first
Jul 11 20:54:35 <hortiel_>	I did M-x customize-face match ; so it should display hightlight match fonts, but in file it doesn't , I also click apply for other sessions too to make it persist... but no such match face shown.
Jul 11 20:56:06 <hortiel_>	alt+o b ; but bold does not persist...
Jul 11 20:56:36 <hortiel_>	I want my features to be usable... emacs is not doing even the basics. Can you point me to a manual that can guide me.
Jul 11 20:57:26 <JordiGH>	,dk M-o
Jul 11 20:57:26 <fsbot>	facemenu-keymap is a sparse keymap in `facemenu.el'.
Jul 11 20:57:26 <fsbot>	Not documented.
Jul 11 20:57:37 <JordiGH>	Huh, I didn't know about this.
Jul 11 20:58:22 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Well, there's the Emacs manual, but I think you're trying to use a subset of Emacs features in a particular way.
Jul 11 20:58:47 <JordiGH>	I don't really understand what you're using, org-mode? Something else? I haven't seen org-mode users who dislike sexps.
Jul 11 20:59:48 <hortiel_>	since themes tat I selected write the code for me in .emacs file, why can't emacs do the same for other settings...I am sure emacs can
Jul 11 21:00:01 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: I am using no mode
Jul 11 21:00:24 <hortiel_>	although I can use enriched mode, if you say so, since it's easy, very easy
Jul 11 21:00:31 <JordiGH>	Emacs always has a mode.
Jul 11 21:00:42 <hortiel_>	i know, what is sexps, 
Jul 11 21:01:02 <JordiGH>	A sexp is a symbolic expression, what lisp is made out of. These (things (written in) parens).
Jul 11 21:01:33 <hortiel_>	those are list expressions. did you mean S-expressions? 
Jul 11 21:01:46 <JordiGH>	sexps, yeah, S-expressions.
Jul 11 21:01:51 <hortiel_>	looks like it, too many acronyms.
Jul 11 21:02:04 <hortiel_>	I like sexps
Jul 11 21:02:12 <fiddlerwoaroof>	Does anyone use tide-mode for javascript? and, have you had issues with timeouts while completing?
Jul 11 21:02:22 <hortiel_>	I am from python background.
Jul 11 21:02:25 <JordiGH>	So anyway, Emacs isn't generally meant to be configured without writing stuff into your .emacs/init.el file.
Jul 11 21:02:54 <JordiGH>	A lot of people actually dislike customize because it tries to automatically write stuff into your .emacs
Jul 11 21:03:36 <Sketch>	it's actually kind of surprising at how well customize works even when you modify your .emacs manually
Jul 11 21:03:56 <JordiGH>	And I guess other than customize, I don't know how else to put stuff into your .emacs without writing it yourself. A lot of Emacs libraries use defcustom to hook their config variables into Customize, but not everything is there.
Jul 11 21:03:59 <fiddlerwoaroof>	I set my custom-file to ~/.emacs.d/custom.el
Jul 11 21:04:08 <fiddlerwoaroof>	And then load-file that on startup.
Jul 11 21:04:18 <bremner>	yes, seperate custom-file should really be the default
Jul 11 21:04:18 <Howitzer105mm>	fiddlerwoaroof: You beat me to it.
Jul 11 21:04:38 <fiddlerwoaroof>	That way I don't mix generated code and manual code
Jul 11 21:05:41 <JordiGH>	I just have one big ol' .emacs and it's not that big.
Jul 11 21:06:19 <fiddlerwoaroof>	I usually eventually move settings I like from custom.el to a use-package form, though
Jul 11 21:08:42 <Sketch>	i have a big ol' emacs and i still use customize, though i have a few additions split out into separate files too
Jul 11 21:09:03 <JordiGH>	Speaking of which, I should probably do some tidying, brb.
Jul 11 21:09:15 <bremner>	uhoh, monkjan is home
Jul 11 21:09:27 <hortiel_>	but why they dont use enriched mode? I think it's enriched enough.
Jul 11 21:09:39 <Sketch>	don't want her see how dirty the .emacs.d is?
Jul 11 21:09:45 <bremner>	hortiel_: what do you want to use enriched mode _for_ ?
Jul 11 21:09:46 <hortiel_>	in org mode too will I be forced to write code to persist my changes?
Jul 11 21:09:57 <hortiel_>	bremner: to persist to persist.....
Jul 11 21:10:01 <bremner>	writing documents that only you will read is, uh, eccentric
Jul 11 21:10:16 <bremner>	but if that's your use case, knock yourself out
Jul 11 21:10:59 <hortiel_>	well those are not latex files, so no it's not source documents, but graphics.. like colors, life without colors is not what I want, othewise I'd have gone for latex. 
Jul 11 21:11:28 <hortiel_>	or html code
Jul 11 21:11:42 <hortiel_>	what you see is what you get is what I need. not html code
Jul 11 21:12:21 <bremner>	hortiel_: OK. Suppose you finish editing your document. What are you going to do, print it out? send it to a friend?
Jul 11 21:12:25 <hortiel_>	Those are my personal notes not documents . so I don't like latex/html.
Jul 11 21:12:38 <hortiel_>	bremner: to no one. just read it myself.
Jul 11 21:12:42 <bremner>	*shrug*. ok.
Jul 11 21:13:17 <hortiel_>	bremner: but I'd send it to a friend to impress him. 
Jul 11 21:13:27 <bremner>	only if your friend uses emacs
Jul 11 21:14:07 <hortiel_>	no I'd export it to pdf. it's the same thing. or to html.
Jul 11 21:14:28 <hortiel_>	my friend does not even know what the heck is emacs!! let alone use it
Jul 11 21:14:40 <bremner>	and enriched-mode supports pdf output?
Jul 11 21:15:26 <hortiel_>	ask anyone have you heard of emacs, they will say O.0. you ask me can I export- I will say 0.0 no idea 
Jul 11 21:16:06 <fiddlerwoaroof>	You could use htmlize and then something that converts html to pdf
Jul 11 21:16:25 <jfb4>	hi all - elpy-mode related question: how to get the equivalent of go-to-definition (M-. in lisp) or symbol lookup (C-h S) for Python statements keywords (not just code you load) - doesn't seem to be part of elpy or python-mode
Jul 11 21:16:35 <JordiGH>	There, few commits pushed: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/
Jul 11 21:17:15 <hortiel_>	so if I use orgmode and make changes, will I have to write a config file, for like basic stuff... what the heck
Jul 11 21:17:32 <hortiel_>	I will export some one else's config file in that case!
Jul 11 21:18:09 <technomancy>	lol butts https://gitlab.com/marcowahl/lisp-butt-mode
Jul 11 21:18:11 <hortiel_>	did you read teh master emacs in one year guide on github.com? it shows all
Jul 11 21:18:11 <JordiGH>	lol
Jul 11 21:18:40 <hortiel_>	is there a anal mode as well
Jul 11 21:19:06 <greenline>	strict parens ;-)
Jul 11 21:19:21 <parsnip>	was "as" the pun?
Jul 11 21:19:34 <greenline>	err smartparens strict I guess
Jul 11 21:19:38 <Sketch>	til github is pretty much useless in emacs-w3m
Jul 11 21:19:38 <parsnip>	hortiel_: *an anal
Jul 11 21:19:54 <JordiGH>	wut wut
Jul 11 21:20:13 <greenline>	> til github is pretty much useless
Jul 11 21:20:33 <Sketch>	sorry, gitlab, not github
Jul 11 21:20:43 <Sketch>	though that may be true as well
Jul 11 21:20:48 <technomancy>	Sketch: yeah their UI is very JS heavy and bad
Jul 11 21:20:51 <technomancy>	(but I repeat myself)
Jul 11 21:21:06 <hortiel_>	I am upset at emacs... that you have left me any choice to persist my changes, without writing code in elisp
Jul 11 21:21:11 <technomancy>	github mostly works without js as long as you don't use their code review system
Jul 11 21:21:23 <technomancy>	in fact, it works better without js
Jul 11 21:21:35 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: You needed more changes than those provided by Customize?
Jul 11 21:21:36 <greenline>	We have many users who are shocked to find out that one can git without github
Jul 11 21:21:37 <Sketch>	if you use customize, you can persist your changes with customize.  otherwise, how are you making changes without "writing code" int he first place?
Jul 11 21:21:43 <technomancy>	because they don't do their stupid "C-k does a useless markdown thing" bit
Jul 11 21:21:44 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: yes
Jul 11 21:21:52 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: I am sorry for your lots.
Jul 11 21:22:03 <hortiel_>	no I am what is cutomize, maybe I misread
Jul 11 21:22:16 <Sketch>	M-x customize
Jul 11 21:22:23 <technomancy>	customize is a trap to trick newbies into thinking they don't need to write code
Jul 11 21:22:29 <hortiel_>	M-x customize-face match ; but it doesn't customize I see the same crap in the tutorial!! 
Jul 11 21:22:35 <hortiel_>	it doesn't work at all
Jul 11 21:22:40 <JordiGH>	technomancy: I really want Firefox to ban websites from binding keys.
Jul 11 21:22:53 <JordiGH>	I have never though, ah, yes, your stupid keyboard shortcuts defined via js, this is what I really wanted in my life.
Jul 11 21:23:04 <JordiGH>	Not even once.
Jul 11 21:23:12 <hortiel_>	try it JordiGH and tell me if it shows beautiful pink highlight in `match` format. JordiGH ???
Jul 11 21:23:13 <fsbot>	Signs point to yes!
Jul 11 21:23:14 <Sketch>	that was one nice thing about conkeror
Jul 11 21:23:23 <technomancy>	JordiGH: this is why I have exwm to protect me
Jul 11 21:23:39 <technomancy>	you have no power over my C-k, stupid web sites!
Jul 11 21:24:01 *	technomancy casts "avert"
Jul 11 21:24:09 <Howitzer105mm>	What does C-k do on web sites?
Jul 11 21:24:16 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Where'd you even come up with this face name?
Jul 11 21:24:36 <hortiel_>	M-x list-faces-display ; chose match
Jul 11 21:24:40 <technomancy>	Howitzer105mm: on github it does something stupid like insert []() for a link
Jul 11 21:24:46 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ? have you even seen the list?
Jul 11 21:25:00 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Which list?
Jul 11 21:25:02 <technomancy>	which is stupid because the whole point of markdown is that it's plain text and you don't need rich text editor support
Jul 11 21:25:07 <Howitzer105mm>	Oh... so if you're using a Markdown web editor....
Jul 11 21:25:08 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: What are you trying to match?
Jul 11 21:25:16 <technomancy>	Howitzer105mm: if you're using github, you don't get a choice
Jul 11 21:25:24 <technomancy>	it's infuriating
Jul 11 21:25:24 <JordiGH>	Oh, list-faces-display
Jul 11 21:25:33 <JordiGH>	That's a shitload of faces.
Jul 11 21:25:44 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: How do you know which one of these faces you want?
Jul 11 21:26:06 <hodapp>	rudybot: silicon. saline. poison. inject me, baby, I'm a free bitch.
Jul 11 21:26:12 <rudybot>	hodapp: With a saline resistant nano paint!
Jul 11 21:26:12 <hodapp>	clearly, rudybot is in need of more Lady Gaga lyrics.
Jul 11 21:26:38 <hodapp>	rudybot: STAHP TELEPHONING ME >:O
Jul 11 21:26:38 <rudybot>	hodapp: when did telephoning change from asking an operator to connect you to a number to direct-dialling? during the war?
Jul 11 21:26:51 <JordiGH>	hodapp: Hey, where have all of the matrix questions gone?
Jul 11 21:26:58 <hodapp>	JordiGH: Ehhh?
Jul 11 21:27:04 <hodapp>	JordiGH: did you take the blue pill or the red pill?
Jul 11 21:27:10 <JordiGH>	idk, it's like you don't even care anymore
Jul 11 21:27:18 <JordiGH>	We used to be so tight, talking maths.
Jul 11 21:27:23 <JordiGH>	Now, not even a postcard.
Jul 11 21:27:25 <JordiGH>	;_;
Jul 11 21:27:37 <Sketch>	technomancy: you don't have to use the web editor for code, though
Jul 11 21:27:38 <Sketch>	luckily
Jul 11 21:28:53 <Sketch>	it's also nice that they have a CLI tool to let you make pull requests
Jul 11 21:28:55 <technomancy>	Sketch: yes, but at work I can't get around using the code review features
Jul 11 21:29:13 <hodapp>	JordiGH: I dunno, but if I get back into renderers and shit, I might have some more.
Jul 11 21:29:16 <hodapp>	also in the process of learning Julia.
Jul 11 21:29:17 <technomancy>	the pull request CLI is nice but it's frustrating that we can't just use email
Jul 11 21:29:21 <Sketch>	yeah, you still have to use the web to view code and comment/merge (i think)
Jul 11 21:29:27 *	hodapp randomly tears a book on R in half and shoves it into rudybot
Jul 11 21:29:39 <technomancy>	merging is easy without the web site but commenting on specific pieces of code isn't
Jul 11 21:29:57 <technomancy>	you can use email to comment on the entire PR as a whole but not on a line-by-line basis
Jul 11 21:30:19 <parsnip>	any one using JellyBean
Jul 11 21:30:25 <Sketch>	hmm, i should figure out how to merge with hub
Jul 11 21:30:32 <technomancy>	rudybot: is Julia named after the Beatles song?
Jul 11 21:30:36 <rudybot>	technomancy: [google]    http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/lovely-rita-lyrics-the-beatles/5da44f309abd5c0548256bc20013e931
Jul 11 21:30:37 <technomancy>	Sketch: not with hub, just with git
Jul 11 21:30:41 <Sketch>	oh
Jul 11 21:30:57 <JordiGH>	What *is* Julia named after?
Jul 11 21:31:16 <bremner>	the song from the eurithmics album 1984
Jul 11 21:31:22 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: i did M-x customize-face highlight and then clicked on apply and without closing emacs switched to TUTORIAL still nothing 
Jul 11 21:31:37 <Sketch>	technomancy: even when the repo requres approval for merging?
Jul 11 21:31:38 <hodapp>	JordiGH: probably the fractal.
Jul 11 21:31:44 <hodapp>	maybe the marijuana.
Jul 11 21:31:47 <JordiGH>	Apparently it's named after nothing
Jul 11 21:31:51 <technomancy>	Sketch: oh, no idea
Jul 11 21:31:56 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: how do i know which faces? I saw their beauty
Jul 11 21:32:02 <technomancy>	Sketch: depends on the protections to the master branch, I guess
Jul 11 21:32:12 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Are you trying to change the faced named "match"? Do you know where this face is used?
Jul 11 21:32:13 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: match and highlight appears goood
Jul 11 21:32:34 <JordiGH>	Are you trying to in fact change the isearch face?
Jul 11 21:33:08 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: just experimenting M-x facemenu-set-face match ; works but not with M-x customize ? 
Jul 11 21:33:14 <Sketch>	technomancy: ah, neat, it works.
Jul 11 21:33:31 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: How are you telling customize to save it, for all future sessions?
Jul 11 21:33:33 <JordiGH>	And this session?
Jul 11 21:33:35 <hortiel_>	no I want to display that "match" cool face when i type
Jul 11 21:33:39 <Sketch>	git checkout master; git merge my-approved-branch ; git push
Jul 11 21:33:51 <hortiel_>	yes told it save future sessions as well, still nothing
Jul 11 21:34:04 <JordiGH>	Erm, anyone else who knows Emacs: where is the "match" face used? Can you explain what hortiel_ is doing?
Jul 11 21:34:14 <hortiel_>	maybe my earlier theme is interfereing? but it said saved in ~/emacs.d/...
Jul 11 21:34:25 <hortiel_>	so clearly it got save as well
Jul 11 21:35:22 <hortiel_>	i don't care where match is used I tried with highlight as well, it works in facemenu-set-face but not with customize-face highlight 
Jul 11 21:35:42 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: you try it yourself, and see the results in front of your eyes, i am not lying.
Jul 11 21:36:02 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: I have no idea wtf you're doing and you lack the Emacs vocabulary to explain it. I'm hoping someone else can explain it.
Jul 11 21:36:34 <JordiGH>	Can you perhaps show a video with your recorded keystrokes?
Jul 11 21:39:27 <twrk>	can you see results behind your eyes?
Jul 11 21:42:09 <hortiel_>	https://i.imgur.com/6he6S4J.png
Jul 11 21:42:29 <hortiel_>	twrk: no but you can see the results in front of your eyes!!
Jul 11 21:44:25 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/5wvgg4A.png
Jul 11 21:46:33 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: Which mode are you changing the face highlighting. i.e. what is that pages parent?
Jul 11 21:46:43 <JordiGH>	What is the highlight face anyway?
Jul 11 21:46:44 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/7BFY3f2.png https://imgur.com/bMQfrLu.png
Jul 11 21:47:18 <JordiGH>	Hm, hl-line mode seems to use the highlight face.
Jul 11 21:47:28 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: What are you expecting in the tutorial buffer to use the higlight face?
Jul 11 21:47:53 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: didn't you find the red-face beautifuL? it's pretty attractive
Jul 11 21:48:05 <JordiGH>	Okay, so how are you doing that?
Jul 11 21:48:11 <JordiGH>	What is "highlighting"?
Jul 11 21:48:17 <hortiel_>	I want that attractive face using M-x customize-face match 
Jul 11 21:48:32 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: what are you babbling. I just want that face, it's looks pretty
Jul 11 21:48:40 <JordiGH>	What are you doing to set that face and what are you doing in the tutorial buffer to change the face to that red face?
Jul 11 21:48:46 <JordiGH>	Okay.
Jul 11 21:48:50 <JordiGH>	A face is a property of text.
Jul 11 21:48:59 <JordiGH>	Each character on your screen has a face.
Jul 11 21:49:14 <JordiGH>	M-x describe-face will tell you what the face at the current cursor position is.
Jul 11 21:49:20 <hortiel_>	yes you told me to customize and now you keep question  why I do this. because it's looks sexy. 
Jul 11 21:49:33 <JordiGH>	In order to change text looks, you have to change their face.
Jul 11 21:49:56 <hortiel_>	yes, I did change face using M-x customize but nothing happened.
Jul 11 21:50:13 <JordiGH>	I am asking you: what is the name of the red face, how did you activate this face, and how did you change this face's properties to have a red background?
Jul 11 21:50:33 <hortiel_>	as I showed you the proof, and it says it saved it in ~/.emacs and still doesn't even work, let alone persist after boot .
Jul 11 21:50:43 <JordiGH>	I will repeat the question.
Jul 11 21:50:48 <hortiel_>	M-x facemenu-set-face match 
Jul 11 21:51:08 <JordiGH>	How did you set this text's face to red face? And what is this face's name?
Jul 11 21:51:16 <hortiel_>	M-x facemenu-set-face match 
Jul 11 21:51:17 <JordiGH>	What did you do, did you drag the mouse across the buffer?
Jul 11 21:51:22 <hortiel_>	it's name is "match"
Jul 11 21:51:42 <JordiGH>	No, "M-x facemenu-set-face match" answers the question, "how did you set the face's properties".
Jul 11 21:51:49 <JordiGH>	I'm not asking now how you set the face's properties.
Jul 11 21:52:22 <JordiGH>	I'm asking, how did you change the face those characters are using? They had a different face with a dark blue background before (which has some other name), and you changed their face to a face with a red background.
Jul 11 21:52:31 <JordiGH>	What action did you do to change the face of those characters?
Jul 11 21:54:50 <hortiel_>	maybe you are on spacemacs so it's different for you. On gnuemacs faces like match and highlight change the background to Red and Blue respectively. 
Jul 11 21:55:02 <JordiGH>	Wait.
Jul 11 21:55:03 <JordiGH>	Argh.
Jul 11 21:55:05 <hortiel_>	other faces don't
Jul 11 21:55:11 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: You have set the HIGHTLIGHT face?
Jul 11 21:55:15 <JordiGH>	facemenu-set-face doesn't change the face's properties.
Jul 11 21:55:25 <JordiGH>	facemenu-set-face changes the face of the characters.
Jul 11 21:55:35 <JordiGH>	character -> face -> colours
Jul 11 21:55:48 <JordiGH>	You're modifying the (character -> face) relationship with facemenu-set-face
Jul 11 21:56:08 <JordiGH>	You are modifying the (face -> colours) relationship with Customize.
Jul 11 21:56:47 <JordiGH>	It's two different things.
Jul 11 21:56:58 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: And it appears he's changed the Highlight in the Customize mode to a magenta.
Jul 11 21:58:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: In theory, if you put your cursor at the beginning of the first line in your buffer, and then Shift->right arrow, each right arrow click will highlight your text in magenta.
Jul 11 21:58:44 <Howitzer105mm>	You have to actually "highlight" the text for the font to change color
Jul 11 21:59:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Hm, are you sure that's the right face for tmm?
Jul 11 21:59:19 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: What's tmm
Jul 11 21:59:28 <JordiGH>	transient-mark-mode, the thing that shows the region.
Jul 11 21:59:33 <Howitzer105mm>	Ah...
Jul 11 21:59:35 <JordiGH>	I disable it.
Jul 11 21:59:55 <JordiGH>	But I see blue when I enable tmm and my highlight face is grey.
Jul 11 21:59:56 <Howitzer105mm>	Well I don't know which sub-tree he's set the highlight face to.
Jul 11 22:00:29 <hortiel_>	https://imgur.com/27vtpYh.png I typed as you said M-x describe-face ; then it said Describe face (default 'default'):   ;and the cursor is waiting for me to RET so I did , and got that window. No idea what a face is. 
Jul 11 22:00:43 <Howitzer105mm>	I have not modified my highlight face. So when I set a mark, and move the cursor I get light on sky blue text
Jul 11 22:00:54 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: A face is a property of a character. A colour is a property of a face.
Jul 11 22:01:09 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face never told me what the face at the current cursor posittion is ... it kept quiet
Jul 11 22:01:13 <Howitzer105mm>	Loosely speaking Face -> Font
Jul 11 22:01:31 <Howitzer105mm>	You have not actually HIGHLIGHED anything in your buffer
Jul 11 22:01:46 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: And your highlight face has a blue background?
Jul 11 22:01:48 <Howitzer105mm>	Click and drag your mouse across your first line of text
Jul 11 22:01:55 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: yes
Jul 11 22:02:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: i.e. Hightlight your text, as in any other X11 program
Jul 11 22:02:32 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: The face name it shows you before you hit <RET> is the face name at the current position.
Jul 11 22:02:53 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: What's the colour? Like, its name or hex value.
Jul 11 22:03:09 <JordiGH>	Why did I modify my highlight face to grey but tmm is showing blue?
Jul 11 22:03:19 <Howitzer105mm>	Uhhh... I don't have the magic incantation to determine that
Jul 11 22:03:21 <hortiel_>	ok when I change the customize option to green, the M-x facemenu-set-face too shows green in highlight for some reason.
Jul 11 22:03:29 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: If you try describe-face on the red background, I expect you'll see a different name suggested by M-x describe-face
Jul 11 22:03:41 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: M-x describe-face highlight
Jul 11 22:04:30 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: You're changing the face's properties in Customize but you're changing the characters' properties in facemenu-set-face
Jul 11 22:05:03 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ok it says Describe face (default 'match'):   ; and waits for my input.
Jul 11 22:05:13 <hortiel_>	JordiGH: ok
Jul 11 22:05:15 <hortiel_>	got it
Jul 11 22:05:16 <JordiGH>	hortiel_: Right, because you changed the face of those characters to be the match face.
Jul 11 22:05:49 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Interesting, when I move my tmm I get text with a blue background, yet highlight in my cpp buffer says the background is darkolivegreen
Jul 11 22:06:45 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Though my foreground-color is green3 and my background is black, so I don't know how that affects what emacs does.
Jul 11 22:07:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: That's because I don't think tmm is using the highlight face. I don't know *what* face it's using.
Jul 11 22:07:58 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Ah, I think it's the region face.
Jul 11 22:08:42 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Changing to black foreground, white background, highlight changes to darkseagreen2.  My tmm shading appears light gray
Jul 11 22:09:00 <Howitzer105mm>	with some transparency
Jul 11 22:09:21 <hortiel_>	what's tmm and cpp buffer Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 22:09:51 <Howitzer105mm>	Ah.... that is the "region" face
Jul 11 22:10:01 <JordiGH>	Howitzer105mm: Well, setting the region face to hotpink gives me https://jordi.platinum.edu.pl/piccies/Screenshot.png
Jul 11 22:10:32 <JordiGH>	tmm is transient-mark-mode, the thing that shows the region. 
Jul 11 22:10:39 <JordiGH>	The region is the place between the mark and point.
Jul 11 22:10:43 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: tmm = transient mark mode, which is Emacs speak for the area highlighted between "point" and "mark"
Jul 11 22:10:55 <JordiGH>	The point is the location between characters indicated by the cursor.
Jul 11 22:11:03 <Howitzer105mm>	cpp = the C plus plus language, which has nothing to do with the issue
Jul 11 22:11:25 <JordiGH>	So you set a mark, you move the point, and the region between it gets highlighted a different colour by tmm.
Jul 11 22:11:55 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: "region" face changes to blue3 background using my normal color scheme
Jul 11 22:12:12 <JordiGH>	Yeah, idk.
Jul 11 22:12:41 <JordiGH>	I gotta go home, hit the gym.
Jul 11 22:12:52 <Howitzer105mm>	JordiGH: Have fun!
Jul 11 22:17:49 <hortiel_>	when I write in terminal tty1 , say, what is the color of the face? since face is the aura around the character I assume it is black in tty virtual console?
Jul 11 22:22:08 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: What is displayed in a xterm, gnome-session, konsole all depends upon a variety of factors.  Try to stay focused upon the program you are trying to configure, not on programs you aren't
Jul 11 22:26:10 <solrize>	hi i upgraded to debian 10 and my emacs docs went away.  some web search indicates they are in a nonfree package because of the gfdl (sheesh) but i can't find that either
Jul 11 22:26:16 <solrize>	e.g. emacs24-common-non-dfsg
Jul 11 22:26:21 <solrize>	or the current version 26
Jul 11 22:26:39 <solrize>	(or 25 for that matter).  anyone been hearing about this?
Jul 11 22:30:02 <hortiel_>	Howitzer105mm: how long you been emacsing
Jul 11 22:30:14 <hortiel_>	you seem to ask amateur like me
Jul 11 22:33:17 <hortiel_>	solrize: you lost your configs or what?
Jul 11 22:34:36 <solrize>	not sure what happened on this box but i notice that apt/sources.list is mirrors.kernel.org so maybe that's missing the nonfree repo.  i was about to try updating from ftp.us.debian.org and seeing if that helps.  package is emacs-common-non-dfsg over on another machine .    sec
Jul 11 22:35:22 <solrize>	yeah!  that worked
Jul 11 22:35:23 <solrize>	thanks
Jul 11 22:35:46 <quiliro>	hello
Jul 11 22:35:55 <quiliro>	i am an emacs newbie
Jul 11 22:36:05 <solrize>	welcome quijote 
Jul 11 22:36:11 <solrize>	oops quiliro
Jul 11 22:36:39 <quiliro>	solrize: thank you... it is an alias :-)
Jul 11 22:36:47 <solrize>	oh hehe
Jul 11 22:37:30 <quiliro>	not right now...but i like it
Jul 11 22:37:53 <quiliro>	kiĥote is better for me 
Jul 11 22:38:01 <quiliro>	but that is not what brings me here
Jul 11 22:38:10 <quiliro>	i have a font problem
Jul 11 22:38:25 <quiliro>	 
Jul 11 22:38:25 <quiliro>	😴
Jul 11 22:38:33 <quiliro>	does not display on my emacs
Jul 11 22:39:07 <quiliro>	i do not know what font i must install or configure on emacs for that to display correctly
Jul 11 22:39:19 <average>	quiliro: just get a monospace font that works ok on your side
Jul 11 22:39:35 <average>	quiliro: the minimum effort solution is to use a monospace font already present on your system
Jul 11 22:39:56 <average>	https://gist.github.com/smandy/9440173
Jul 11 22:40:00 <average>	list them like this ^^
Jul 11 22:40:03 <quiliro>	ok....i will research that...thank you average
Jul 11 22:40:16 <quiliro>	nice
Jul 11 22:41:01 <quiliro>	will that work directly on the emacs config file?
Jul 11 22:41:45 <average>	probably
Jul 11 22:41:46 <average>	TIAS
Jul 11 22:42:29 <average>	my guess is that yes they will
Jul 11 22:42:45 <quiliro>	21.8 Fonts 
Jul 11 22:42:52 <quiliro>	says that
Jul 11 22:43:02 <quiliro>	By default, Emacs displays text on graphical displays using a 10-point
Jul 11 22:43:02 <quiliro>	monospace font.
Jul 11 22:43:11 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I've been using Emacs for decades.
Jul 11 22:43:17 <quiliro>	how can i know which font i am using?
Jul 11 22:43:34 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I just don't bother to change the default Face (aka Font).
Jul 11 22:43:50 <quiliro>	oh! fonts are faces?
Jul 11 22:44:02 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 22:44:03 <dale>	average: Is quiliro asking how to display a nice font, or specifically how to get a font that will display emoji?
Jul 11 22:44:20 <quiliro>	dale the latter
Jul 11 22:44:22 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: There is always some new thing to learn
Jul 11 22:44:42 <dale>	quiliro: What OS are you on?
Jul 11 22:44:53 <quiliro>	Guix System
Jul 11 22:45:07 <quiliro>	GNU
Jul 11 22:45:16 <Howitzer105mm>	Faces is the Emacs speak for Font.  There may be some esoteric difference that I don't recognize.
Jul 11 22:45:51 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 22:46:52 <dale>	quiliro: My go-to is to install and use https://github.com/rolandwalker/unicode-fonts, but I don't hear of many others here using it for some reason.  I *think* this package will try to configure the best fonts for various character ranges, including emoji, and I *think* it will work on Linux.
Jul 11 22:47:03 <dale>	quiliro: (I use that on macOS to configure my fonts, including emoji.)
Jul 11 22:47:50 <quiliro>	dale: thank you...i will study it
Jul 11 22:48:06 <Howitzer105mm>	I just use whatever font is preconfig'd on my distro.  I dislike trying to figure out how to use Linux fonts.  They are not intuitive in my opinion.
Jul 11 22:49:21 <hortiel_>	color on that face persists after boot , but how do I make the face too persist, I'd like to use match face by default? 
Jul 11 22:49:30 <hortiel_>	how to do that without writing code in elisp
Jul 11 22:49:46 <hortiel_>	is there a way using menu bar in emacs ? 
Jul 11 22:50:25 <quiliro>	hortiel_: F10?
Jul 11 22:52:20 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: F10->Options->Customize Emacs->Set Faces....
Jul 11 22:52:59 <Howitzer105mm>	The fonts/colors can be configured here based on Major Mode
Jul 11 22:56:18 <kenrestivo>	small faces
Jul 11 22:57:03 <hortiel_>	which mode
Jul 11 22:57:24 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: What/who are you asking?
Jul 11 22:58:04 <parsnip>	🤏😉
Jul 11 22:58:58 <hortiel_>	the channel.
Jul 11 23:00:31 <hortiel_>	I did go to Customize Emacs but -> Set Faces no such option so instead I went to -> specific face and selected there 
Jul 11 23:02:04 <dale>	parsnip: Hm, I lack a font for "pinching hand" it seems.
Jul 11 23:02:16 <parsnip>	dale: no, it hasn't been released, it was deliberate
Jul 11 23:02:22 <parsnip>	"small faces"
Jul 11 23:02:42 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: if you wanna change the default font you should be able to M-x cu-f <RET> default, then tamper with it however you like and hit 'Apply and Save'...
Jul 11 23:02:44 <hortiel_>	but when I type in tutorial after reboot emacs it's still not showing match face by default? so it shows match face only when I search using C-s and when the text in the tutorial "matches"
Jul 11 23:02:53 <parsnip>	dale: glad someone caught that
Jul 11 23:02:54 <hortiel_>	kiki_lamb: i did
Jul 11 23:02:56 <dale>	parsnip: Ah ha!
Jul 11 23:03:12 <parsnip>	it's just a blank space here
Jul 11 23:03:23 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: hmm. if it's not returning post boot, something's going wrong with the save part. I'd open your .emacs and check to see whether the face is actually getting saved.
Jul 11 23:03:26 <dale>	parsnip: You track unreleased emoji, eh?  Emoji connoisseur?
Jul 11 23:03:37 <parsnip>	lol
Jul 11 23:03:55 <dale>	Thank goodness someone made emojipedia.org.
Jul 11 23:04:00 <parsnip>	dale: we were discussing the new blood emoji, which is kind of a big deal
Jul 11 23:04:05 <dale>	I guess MS must have shipped it already: https://emojipedia.org/pinching-hand/
Jul 11 23:04:07 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: after hitting 'Apply and Save', it should add a block like (custom-set-faces ...) to your .emacs with the settings...
Jul 11 23:04:29 <dale>	parsnip: This is https://emojipedia.org/drop-of-blood/ ?
Jul 11 23:04:33 <parsnip>	yes
Jul 11 23:04:38 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: That's because it is only highlighting for "matches".  That's what that face is supposed to do.
Jul 11 23:04:49 <parsnip>	dale: it was partly pushed for by a "girls" group in UK
Jul 11 23:04:52 <dale>	Serves me right for not having a bouncer with replay.
Jul 11 23:04:52 <Howitzer105mm>	Likewise when you hightlight text, the color will change
Jul 11 23:04:57 <dale>	parsnip: I'm seeing that now.
Jul 11 23:05:15 <dale>	I am an alien with blue blood, they had better support a variant selector for blood color.
Jul 11 23:05:24 <parsnip>	but does microsoft actually have it on any devices?
Jul 11 23:05:30 <parsnip>	lol
Jul 11 23:05:45 <parsnip>	blue lives matter
Jul 11 23:05:51 <parsnip>	how dare you!
Jul 11 23:06:31 <parsnip>	oh, they have groups of emoji for events
Jul 11 23:06:47 <dale>	parsnip: Emojipedia says it was released to Windows 10 users in the May 2019 update, so I guess so?  https://blog.emojipedia.org/windows-10-may-2019-update-emoji-changelog/
Jul 11 23:06:51 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: So for your colors to change, as you have them currently configured, you have to perform some action, such as click/drag (i.e. highlight), or perform some action that displays a text match (i.e. search)
Jul 11 23:06:55 <parsnip>	hmm
Jul 11 23:07:04 <hortiel_>	Howitzer105mm: there are other faces that don't highlight? and the font too appears the same
Jul 11 23:07:17 <parsnip>	🤏🍆
Jul 11 23:07:18 <dale>	This site seems scarily comprehensive.
Jul 11 23:07:27 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: You have not changed a face that is just always active on "static" text.
Jul 11 23:07:44 <parsnip>	dale: have you also seen sites on kaomoji
Jul 11 23:07:45 <Howitzer105mm>	hortiel_: I don't get the drift of your last q
Jul 11 23:08:00 <kiki_lamb>	hortiel_: if you wanna make a (close to) global change, make sure you're editing the face named 'default'
Jul 11 23:08:04 <hortiel_>	what is the point of faces that don't highlight.
Jul 11 23:08:05 <dale>	parsnip: No, googling...
Jul 11 23:08:21 <hortiel_>	kiki_lamb: will it persist after boot
Jul 11 23:08:21 <parsnip>	vitamin D
Jul 11 23:08:35 <e1f>	omg, is this mystery hilighting discussion still going on?
Jul 11 23:08:58 <parsnip>	e1f: the colors. they are important
Jul 11 23:08:59 <Howitzer105mm>	You can make Emacs display your text in whatever color you want.  You just have to know which face to configure to make it happen.
Jul 11 23:09:06 <Howitzer105mm>	e1f: Uh... yeah.
Jul 11 23:09:14 <parsnip>	let's focus on the UI before the business logic
Jul 11 23:09:30 <Howitzer105mm>	I should really bow out at this stage, as I DON'T do this.
Jul 11 23:09:53 <hortiel_>	let's say I configured successfully face X. but the face X is still not active under the static text after boot...
Jul 11 23:10:13 <hortiel_>	I have to tell emacs to activate the face X under the text
Jul 11 23:10:22 <Howitzer105mm>	The you didn't save it for future sessions per the Customize menu
Jul 11 23:10:24 <hortiel_>	everytime!!
Jul 11 23:10:35 <hortiel_>	I did Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 23:11:17 <dale>	parsnip: http://japaneseemoticons.me/ seems to have a lot of info but also looks like spam.  They do have a mobile app though so they must be legit, right?
Jul 11 23:11:31 <parsnip>	right
Jul 11 23:11:32 <dale>	parsnip: Let's go with http://kaomoji.ru/en/ instead.  Single page Geocities throwback.
Jul 11 23:11:39 <parsnip>	*inorite
Jul 11 23:11:56 <dale>	Unironic usage of Comic Sans FTW.
Jul 11 23:12:07 <dale>	parsnip: Also, TIL "kaomoji".
Jul 11 23:12:54 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face always says default under the tutorial... I customized it 100 times
Jul 11 23:13:39 <hortiel_>	the color is active on that face, but only after I activate the face, otherwise the face itself is default.
Jul 11 23:14:04 <hortiel_>	it never changes. face never changes, only color for that particular face does upon activation. Howitzer105mm 
Jul 11 23:15:24 <Illya>	(☆ω☆)
Jul 11 23:16:52 <Howitzer105mm>	So you've gone to the Specific Faces menu from Customize.  Found the >Default: element, changed the content, returned to the top of that page, clicked "Apply and Save", and restarting Emacs fails to pick up the color change.
Jul 11 23:17:25 <Howitzer105mm>	The screen shots you provided showed you changing "Highlight" and "Match", not "Default"
Jul 11 23:24:21 <hortiel_>	M-x describe-face ; this shows default Howitzer105mm after C-x C-c 
Jul 11 23:24:57 <hortiel_>	Default: element I guess i didn't change the element. 
Jul 11 23:26:08 <hortiel_>	but enough is enough is for.

Jul 11 23:30:16 <Howitzer105mm>	face-plant
Jul 11 23:30:25 <greenline>	we still talking faces ?

Jul 11 23:43:49 <quiliro>	is there an emacs manual with screenshots?
Jul 11 23:45:03 <Howitzer105mm>	quiliro: None that I know
Jul 11 23:45:12 <quiliro>	ok
Jul 11 23:45:57 <quiliro>	why does the html manual have nicer fonts than the info manual?
Jul 11 23:47:27 <quiliro>	is it because i use a diferent font on info than on eww?
Jul 11 23:51:33 <quiliro>	another question: can life be lived exclusively on emacs without avoiding use of video and audio?

Jul 11 23:54:39 <parsnip>	quiliro: double negative?
Jul 11 23:55:29 <quiliro>	kenrestivo: thank you for your question...life = email with embedded images, videoconferencing, viewing movies, listening to podcasts, being able to see all web pages, audioconferencing, flipping through photographs by seeing self-generated thumbnails in photo directories, etc

Jul 12 13:56:34 <Miyu-chan>	nice*
Jul 12 14:14:22 <nckx>	Uh hello weird Ayn Rand fanchan: My XKB compose key sometimes stops working in emacs after many hours (very rarely though).  ‘<Multi_Key> is undefined’.  It keeps working outside of emacs (and in ‘emacs -nw’).  Is this familiar to anyone?
Jul 12 14:17:41 <fledermaus>	nckx: first of all, how very dare you. second: no, that's weird. I don't even know how that could happen.
Jul 12 14:18:03 <fledermaus>	if you run xev, has anything changed about the events generated by that key?
Jul 12 14:20:40 <nckx>	Well, I've saved a copy to compare to a clean boot next time I can.
Jul 12 14:22:09 <nckx>	What's unexpected (to me) is that restarting my emacs daemon doesn't fix it.  You may be on to something (that it's not emacs' fault, sorry emacs).  But why do compositions keep working everywhere else‽  (← see?)  Gah…

Jul 12 14:35:00 <sindan>	test
Jul 12 14:36:47 <sindan>	is there some size limit to text copied through Ctrl-w? On slime's REPL if I try to copy a couple thousand lines marking them with Ctrl-Space, then moving over to the end of some structure, then Ctrl-w I get "Saved text until ..." in the minubuffer and the text is not copied.
Jul 12 14:37:13 <sindan>	Don't know if this is a bug
Jul 12 14:41:05 <JordiGH>	sindan: Well, your computer has finite memory, so yeah, there's a limit.
Jul 12 14:41:49 <JordiGH>	C-w wipes, M-w is for only saving to the kill ring.
Jul 12 14:42:02 <JordiGH>	Unless SLIME is somehow overwriting it.
Jul 12 14:42:10 <JordiGH>	What does C-h k C-w say in SLIME?
Jul 12 14:52:06 <sindan>	JordiGH, unless the text in the kill ring is very stupidly stored, a couple thousand lines should not even represent a dent in the memory I have available
Jul 12 14:52:38 <sindan>	It happens both with C-w and M-w
Jul 12 14:53:17 <sindan>	slime doesn't change C-w behaviour
Jul 12 14:54:02 <JordiGH>	sindan: So you're wiping the text, right?
Jul 12 14:54:04 <JordiGH>	Not "copying" it?
Jul 12 14:54:23 <JordiGH>	So when you browse the kill ring, you don't see it there?
Jul 12 14:55:09 <sindan>	No
Jul 12 14:55:22 <sindan>	I don't see it there
Jul 12 14:55:23 <JordiGH>	Huh, okay, this only happens in SLIME buffers?
Jul 12 14:55:37 <JordiGH>	Your kill ring is nicely populated in other buffers?
Jul 12 14:55:48 <sindan>	I don't know, I only copy chunks of text in slime buffers tho
Jul 12 14:56:05 <JordiGH>	Wiping you mean?
Jul 12 14:56:18 <JordiGH>	Well, try it in on another buffer and check your kill ring.
Jul 12 14:56:24 <sindan>	both C-w and M-w
Jul 12 14:57:16 <JordiGH>	I mean, in fundamental-mode or whatever, or in the *scratch* buffer.
Jul 12 15:12:47 <fledermaus>	so. who's in toronto?
Jul 12 15:13:07 <JordiGH>	You, I presume.
Jul 12 15:13:17 <JordiGH>	And sacahc.
Jul 12 15:13:20 <JordiGH>	Er, sachac
Jul 12 15:14:32 <fledermaus>	well, not right now.
Jul 12 15:14:42 <fledermaus>	but it looks like I will be there for TIFF 
Jul 12 15:15:03 <JordiGH>	Please tell me you're a, uh, contestant?
Jul 12 15:15:52 <fledermaus>	no.
Jul 12 15:16:41 <fledermaus>	although why not, am I not allowed to? is that what I am to you, a non-film-making joke? huh? HUH? </pesci>
Jul 12 16:10:38 <hortiel>	I shutdown my OS, how did emacs know that it got to #file# save this file? I saw in my dir there was no such file
Jul 12 16:10:49 <hortiel>	as if emacs did time travel like firefox

Jul 12 16:43:02 <kodein>	,yow
Jul 12 16:43:02 <fsbot>	Then, it's off to RED CHINA!!
Jul 12 16:57:47 <kodein>	rudybot: have you ever been to turquoise china?
Jul 12 16:57:59 <rudybot>	kodein: hi everyone ! I have a problem when apply the color-tango-theme, the background is turquoise instead of dark gray ...  http://db.tt/qQ994sy. I am on OSX, emacs installed from mac ports, using GNU Emacs 23.3.1. 
Jul 12 16:58:09 <hortiel>	how does emacs save file after crash?
Jul 12 16:58:26 <hortiel>	or before crash there is no visible file?? can you see it?
Jul 12 16:59:19 <kodein>	it autosaves as #filename#
Jul 12 16:59:46 <hortiel>	how is emacs doing this magic , I created a new file called 'filename' and there is no #filename@ 
Jul 12 16:59:58 <hortiel>	* #filename# 
Jul 12 17:00:38 <hortiel>	I see nothing it autosaves. and .emacs.d/autosave.. what's that doing it has no files even and some code numbers, don't undertand how emacs is doing it
Jul 12 17:00:56 <hortiel>	but when I crash my pc I reeboot, i see #filename# ???
Jul 12 17:00:56 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Jul 12 17:01:07 <hortiel>	emacs did something 
Jul 12 17:01:35 <kodein>	yes. ,,autosave
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	From memory, AutoSave is [0/5] Try M-x customize-group RET auto-save RET
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[1] controlled by auto-save-list-file-prefix
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[2] controlled by auto-save-file-name-transforms
Jul 12 17:01:36 <fsbot>	[3] (info "(emacs)Auto Save") ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Jul 12 17:02:12 <hortiel>	i mean if I immediately open a new file 'filename' and crash the pc, then will it autosave or fail? how much time does emacs take to autosave? 1sec, 1min?
Jul 12 17:03:32 <kodein>	you can customize it, see above. by default it will autosave if you have been idle for 30 seconds
Jul 12 17:04:12 <hortiel>	ok
Jul 12 17:04:20 <kodein>	it will also do it every five minutes by default
Jul 12 17:05:45 <hortiel>	how did you know 30 sec
Jul 12 17:06:17 <kodein>	I went and looked at the customization settings as directed in 18:01 < fsbot> From memory, AutoSave is [0/5] Try M-x customize-group RET auto-save RET
Jul 12 17:07:32 <hortiel>	i too went there,
Jul 12 17:09:16 <hortiel>	i am having difficulty is it because i am new, i mean i read the whole tutorial
Jul 12 17:10:03 <kodein>	you are able to read the documentation for the different settings and can also see the values there. I will have to correct myself regarding the every 5 minutes thing though, it is every 300 input events, not 300 seconds
Jul 12 17:10:24 <hortiel>	ok i understood
Jul 12 17:11:54 <kodein>	basically when starting out with emacs, (and yes, the tutorial is good), one of the more important skills to learn is where to find the documentation and how to look it up, and I do think you are well on your way to getting there
Jul 12 17:13:10 <kodein>	since a core concept of emacs is "self documentation", it also means that most if not all of what you can do is documented, and being able to look it up helps you understand the workings

Jul 15 19:52:27 <fsbot>	lol
Jul 15 19:54:01 <johnjay>	dale: that looks interesting... although having a file just for one function seems overkill
Jul 15 20:02:10 <aveltras>	is anyone using the weechat mode here ? do notifications work ?
Jul 15 20:10:08 <technomancy>	aveltras: I tried it like a year ago. I found that it wasn't synchronizing unread marks correctly.
Jul 15 20:10:58 <aveltras>	technomancy: do you use something else with emacs ?
Jul 15 20:11:30 <technomancy>	aveltras: I use erc for IRC and just regular weechat for slack at work
Jul 15 20:11:36 <technomancy>	(without weechat.el)
Jul 15 20:12:57 <aveltras>	technomancy: hmm ok, did you try https://github.com/yuya373/emacs-slack for slack ?
Jul 15 20:14:09 <technomancy>	aveltras: yes, it didn't work very well when I tried it
Jul 15 20:53:22 <aveltras>	anyone using exwm on a daily basis ? is it smooth sailing ?
Jul 15 20:53:34 <kenrestivo>	i think technomancy does?
Jul 15 20:54:08 <aveltras>	found this https://mastodon.social/@amdt/99438677174378931 which would imply that it was the case at least in the past :p

Jul 15 21:05:31 <technomancy>	I don't understand that link at all
Jul 15 21:05:40 <technomancy>	why would you want two frames that are both emacs side-by-side
Jul 15 21:06:04 <shrysr>	is there some way to not enter your password and server and nickname every time I start up erc?
Jul 15 21:06:15 <technomancy>	,tell shrysr about authinfo.gpg
Jul 15 21:06:15 <fsbot>	shrysr: hmm, auth-sources are One approach is (setq auth-sources '("~/.authinfo.gpg"))
Jul 15 21:07:50 <shrysr>	technomancy: okay - I have that setup for my git repos. How do I add ERC's stuff ?
Jul 15 21:08:05 <technomancy>	hm; I thought the bot would know =)
Jul 15 21:08:31 <technomancy>	I did it once but it was a long time ago
Jul 15 21:08:49 <shrysr>	How do you do it now? ? 
Jul 15 21:09:55 <technomancy>	I just leave my erc running for 9-12 months at a time
Jul 15 21:10:04 <shrysr>	:D
Jul 15 21:10:31 <jaafar>	Meetup coming up this Wednesday in SF: https://www.meetup.com/Emacs-SF/events/262446850/
Jul 15 21:10:51 <shrysr>	The nick and server are specified in the config which I borrowed from sacha chua https://pages.sachachua.com/.emacs.d/Sacha.html .. It still asks me everything.

Jul 15 21:14:33 <technomancy>	shrysr: erc is running on a server which I connect to over mosh from many computers
Jul 15 21:14:58 <shrysr>	so cool :D 
Jul 15 21:19:20 <technomancy>	the only downside is that you can't use RET to browse URLs
Jul 15 21:19:25 <technomancy>	so when URLs wrap across lines it's annoying
Jul 15 21:26:09 <dale>	Is there something like https://dedo.io or Soulver or Calca for Emacs?
Jul 15 21:26:22 <dale>	I started to write out what they do but I'm finding it hard to describe.
Jul 15 21:26:35 <dale>	I'm going to end up with a damnable org table with formulas, aren't I.
Jul 15 21:26:51 <quotemstr>	Is dired-do-query-replace broken for anyone else?
Jul 15 21:27:45 <quotemstr>	It just randomly stops reporting that it replaced zero matches
Jul 15 21:30:29 <parsnip>	rudybot: how many of your commits are titled "blah"
Jul 15 21:30:31 <rudybot>	parsnip: Huh?  I see a section titled `Code', right above the `References' section, but it's empty.
Jul 15 21:31:02 <cvandusen>	Truly bug-free code.
Jul 15 21:31:16 <parsnip>	doesn't work
Jul 15 21:31:26 <cvandusen>	#shipit 
Jul 15 21:31:52 <cvandusen>	the eula will cover it
Jul 15 21:32:18 <parsnip>	does the number of times i do C-x g l a C-x 1 without binding it to a key imply brain damage?
Jul 15 21:33:07 <parsnip>	what would i even bind that to
Jul 15 21:34:10 <parsnip>	hmm, M-x free-keys shows C-x L is unbound
Jul 15 21:34:32 <parsnip>	or i could use C-x M as a prefix
Jul 15 21:34:52 <parsnip>	try the former for now
Jul 15 21:35:33 <npostavs>	dale: maybe calc emebedded mode would be sort of similar
Jul 15 21:36:27 <shrysr>	parsnip: did not know about M-x free-keys :D
Jul 15 21:36:38 <parsnip>	:)
Jul 15 21:37:44 <quotemstr>	Huh
Jul 15 21:37:45 <quotemstr>	Me either
Jul 15 21:37:54 <greenline>	hold up. free-keys?
Jul 15 21:37:55 <dale>	npostavs: I think maybe yes, but I always struggle to understand how to use embedded mode.  For example, I'm not really aware of something that means "recompute everything".  Plus I don't always want to write TeX, but I guess I could probably configure delimiters for Markdown somehow.
Jul 15 21:37:59 <quotemstr>	Oh, it's not standard
Jul 15 21:38:02 <dale>	free-keys is a third-party library, non?
Jul 15 21:38:21 <greenline>	ya
Jul 15 21:38:42 <greenline>	C-M-~ is free!
Jul 15 21:38:58 <greenline>	need to consult an orthopedist and occupational therapist, however
Jul 15 21:39:37 <dale>	And don't forget to add function keys to free-keys-keys, unless you're on a MacBook Pro without function keys oh god shoot me
Jul 15 21:39:50 <dale>	Also, I think super isn't in free-keys-modifiers by default.
Jul 15 21:40:08 <greenline>	Super belongs to i3 for me
Jul 15 21:40:15 <greenline>	but good to know free-keys can get more free
Jul 15 21:42:29 <parsnip>	it weirds me out that q doesn't work in magit
Jul 15 21:42:44 <parsnip>	or M-x magit-status anyways
Jul 15 21:42:47 <parsnip>	you have to C-g
Jul 15 21:43:34 <shrysr>	q buries the buffer I guess.
Jul 15 21:44:29 <dale>	I mean, q does bury the buffer for me.  q no longer exits Magit's new popup modal thing, though.
Jul 15 21:46:32 <parsnip>	sweet:

Jul 15 21:48:20 <parsnip>	and `l l` is a keypress away
Jul 15 21:48:28 <parsnip>	as well as `SPC`, etc
Jul 15 21:59:28 <jlf>	it seems like `l l` is more than a keypress away :p
Jul 15 22:00:44 <parsnip>	😉
Jul 15 22:07:27 <belak>	Is it possible to make a macro (or anything really) which will set a number of variables and call an sexp? Like (with-colors (message background-color)) or something like that, where background color is defined by with-colors
Jul 15 22:08:57 <belak>	I've got a bunch of values in a plist and I'd like to export them as variables
Jul 15 22:11:45 <greenline>	parsnip wait you bound a key to a named function that is defined in the key binding? Or did you just expand to show us what it does?
Jul 15 22:12:19 <parsnip>	greenline: `defun` returns the symbol
Jul 15 22:13:32 <greenline>	huh.
Jul 15 22:13:37 <greenline>	I never thought of doing something like that.
Jul 15 22:13:42 <greenline>	me being... green
Jul 15 22:13:45 <parsnip>	i'm sure i stole it from somewhere
Jul 15 22:13:50 <greenline>	as is tradition
Jul 15 22:13:54 <parsnip>	heh
Jul 15 22:14:28 <aidalgol>	It's not stealing; it's repurposing.
Jul 15 22:21:16 <greenline>	currently reading up on funcall
Jul 15 22:24:44 <johnjay>	it calls a function
Jul 15 22:24:53 <johnjay>	what else do you need to know
Jul 15 22:24:54 *	greenline mind = blown ;-)
Jul 15 22:25:17 <greenline>	yeah, it just so happens that the last "lisp" I was looking at (hy) has function definitons return None
Jul 15 22:25:33 <greenline>	It also doesn't allow () at the top level because Python is immature ;-)
Jul 15 22:26:12 <jlf>	belak: so something like  (bind-plist-properties (a c) '(a 1 b 2 c 3) (list a c)) -> (1 3)  ?
Jul 15 22:26:39 <belak>	jlf: yeah, similar to that
Jul 15 22:27:25 <jlf>	(defmacro bind-plist-properties (prop-vars plist &rest body) "Bind each of PROP-VARS to its associated value in PLIST and execute BODY.

Each PROP may be a plain symbol or a string, but keyword symbols are disallowed.  In the case of property
Jul 15 22:27:25 <jlf>	names of type string, the corresponding plain symbol is bound, e.g. the value associated with a prop of \"name\" would be bound to 'name. \(fn (PROP...)

Jul 15 22:51:47 <parsnip>	now pasting an image from google, that's a long link
Jul 15 22:53:42 <shrysr>	is it possible to automatically shorten any link I paste within emacs? 
Jul 15 22:54:56 <e1f>	there was a bot that used to do that here
Jul 15 22:55:07 <e1f>	be he decided to quit
Jul 15 22:56:30 <technomancy>	around a hundred chars isn't bad. it's the 300+ ones that are annoying
Jul 15 22:56:55 <e1f>	for people using console emacs, 80 chars
Jul 15 22:57:16 <technomancy>	I'm using -nw
Jul 15 22:57:38 <technomancy>	I have to C-x 1 to follow it but I have winner-undo to bring it back so it's only a couple extra keystrokes
Jul 15 22:57:43 <enicar>	that depends on console lines length…
Jul 15 22:57:55 <fledermaus>	rudybot: you give up on shortening urls?
Jul 15 22:57:56 <rudybot>	fledermaus: does shortening URLs bring you happiness?
Jul 15 22:58:12 <shrysr>	I thought -nw meant console emacs ? 
Jul 15 22:58:43 <parsnip>	shrysr: right, in console emacs, i guess emacs can't handle the link for you
Jul 15 22:59:03 <parsnip>	you have to rely on the console detecting it, which it won't if emacs added a line break, etc
Jul 15 22:59:04 <technomancy>	"console" could be used specifically to mean the ctrl-alt-f1 type of console but it is usually used to mean -nw, yeah
Jul 15 23:04:52 <shrysr>	Okay
Jul 15 23:05:29 <parsnip>	if google presents the word "aardvark" when searching for "a", does it make bold all three "a"'s?
Jul 15 23:05:32 <shrysr>	An access token is required, but the url-shortener package seems a decent workaround.
Jul 15 23:06:35 <parsnip>	wait, now it only bolds one "a"
Jul 15 23:07:05 <parsnip>	i thought i was searchign recently and all matches were bold
Jul 15 23:07:17 <parsnip>	invert that
Jul 15 23:07:31 <parsnip>	ah, on mobile chrome, it bolds matches
Jul 15 23:08:53 <parsnip>	hmm, in the "guessing" part, it's inverted, but in the "search results", the matching part is bold. w/e
Jul 15 23:13:30 <belak>	Oof, this is super ugly but is there a better way to do this? https://github.com/belak/base16-emacs/blob/5e95e9ba3549aced37283bdfa4d74908937f0d30/base16-theme.el#L140-L145
Jul 15 23:18:43 <shrysr>	how often do you guys update all your packages? 
Jul 15 23:23:27 <technomancy>	never have, never will
Jul 15 23:40:33 <aidalgol>	shrysr: When I remember.
Jul 15 23:40:37 <aidalgol>	technomancy: You never git pull?
Jul 15 23:40:57 <technomancy>	aidalgol: I never update all packages
Jul 15 23:41:11 <technomancy>	over the past year I've updated two or three individually
Jul 15 23:41:28 <aidalgol>	Afraid of new changes breaking things?
Jul 15 23:41:41 <aidalgol>	It's not as if you're missing out on security fixes in anything but Emacs.
Jul 15 23:41:42 <technomancy>	just don't see the point
Jul 15 23:41:57 <aidalgol>	bug fixes?
Jul 15 23:42:32 <technomancy>	as far as I can tell, the packages I use don't have bugs in the areas of functionality I actually use
Jul 15 23:43:29 <technomancy>	the only exception is I know of one bug in magit when you kill the *magit-process* buffer, but I also know that the fixed version is worse than the version with the bug in it
Jul 15 23:43:39 <technomancy>	(and the manual workaround for the bug is easy)
Jul 15 23:44:43 <aidalgol>	Why haven't you rage-forked magit by now?
Jul 15 23:45:08 <technomancy>	eh no need to fork when the version I'm using is already perfect (other than the bug with an easy workaround)
Jul 15 23:46:12 <aidalgol>	I am genuinely amazed that you are not more into retrocomputing than you are.
Jul 15 23:47:04 <technomancy>	today I had someone say that I should rebuild the Atreus Deck around a RISC-V board and they'd sell like FLOSSnerd hotcakes
Jul 15 23:48:02 <kenrestivo>	isn't risc-v overkill for an atreus keyboard?
Jul 15 23:48:14 <kenrestivo>	it's an arduino, right?
Jul 15 23:48:33 <technomancy>	kenrestivo: not for the keyboard, for the cyberdeck
Jul 15 23:48:40 <kenrestivo>	oh, the android thing?
Jul 15 23:48:44 <technomancy>	https://atreus.technomancy.us/deck
Jul 15 23:48:56 <technomancy>	the current proof-of-concept is android but it's deeply unsatisfying
Jul 15 23:49:05 <kenrestivo>	does anyone even have android running on a risc-v board with all the accoutrements (wifi, bluetooth, baseband) yet?
Jul 15 23:49:36 <technomancy>	baseband like ... GSM?
Jul 15 23:49:41 <kenrestivo>	i guess it doesn't have to be a mobile os then
Jul 15 23:49:47 <kenrestivo>	yes GSM/LTE etc
Jul 15 23:49:48 <e1f>	we're not living in the future yet
Jul 15 23:49:49 <kenrestivo>	baseband
Jul 15 23:50:25 <technomancy>	I'd be happy with just wifi+usb+LVDS... I'd be ecstatic if it had a power management unit but I'm not holding my breath
Jul 15 23:51:24 <average>	is it common of train stations to host a number of hobos
Jul 15 23:51:42 <technomancy>	someone was saying that the one good thing about the trade war with china is that it's spurring serious development into alternatives to ARM
Jul 15 23:51:56 <technomancy>	since the US is bullying ARM into blockading China
Jul 15 23:52:12 <kenrestivo>	https://pulp-platform.github.io/ariane/docs/home/ nothing looks production ready yet
Jul 15 23:52:45 <kenrestivo>	in general the good thing about trade wars is it results in aggressive import substitution
Jul 15 23:54:40 <technomancy>	https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed
Jul 15 23:55:14 <technomancy>	oh shit it's us$999
Jul 15 23:55:43 <technomancy>	I guess I can wait a year or two
Jul 15 23:57:59 <technomancy>	haha this one has wifi by just slapping an esp32 on it wtf https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive1-rev-b
Jul 15 23:59:37 <e1f>	i can't concieve of the chinese making a serious arm alternative
Jul 16 00:00:07 <fledermaus>	e1f: riscv.
Jul 16 00:00:36 <e1f>	that's not chinese though
Jul 16 00:00:48 <e1f>	i meant original
Jul 16 00:00:55 <technomancy>	obligatory https://p.hagelb.org/risc.gif
Jul 16 00:01:10 <fledermaus>	e1f: well riscv is Freely licensed.
Jul 16 00:01:18 <e1f>	i wonder if the u.s. could block riscv export too
Jul 16 00:01:36 <kenrestivo>	the us tried to block export of an algorithm
Jul 16 00:01:43 <kenrestivo>	people put it on t-shirts
Jul 16 00:01:43 <e1f>	yeah
Jul 16 00:02:15 <e1f>	the u.s. could block chinese riscv products
Jul 16 00:02:22 <e1f>	"national security"
Jul 16 00:02:24 <kenrestivo>	lol http://www.cypherspace.org/adam/shirt/
Jul 16 00:04:44 <e1f>	chinese are blocking canadian canola and pork exports
Jul 16 00:05:13 <kenrestivo>	NO BACON FOR YOU!
Jul 16 00:05:19 <kenrestivo>	eh
Jul 16 00:05:36 <e1f>	canada is holding the daughter of huawei ceo on the request from the u.s.
Jul 16 00:06:17 <e1f>	this is how star wars started. a trade dispute that got out of hand
Jul 16 00:07:35 <technomancy>	isn't it against the geneva convention to punish a family member for something their parent did?
Jul 16 00:08:53 <e1f>	she is being held for selling the iranians stuff that was illegal to sell
Jul 16 00:09:30 <parsnip>	hmm, icon for using internal storage. just for debugging for now. guess i'll use a lock.
Jul 16 00:10:38 <technomancy>	ah ok; that's different
Jul 16 00:10:51 <e1f>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Wanzhou
Jul 16 00:12:20 <e1f>	also, the geneva convention applies at wartime; a trade war is not considered wartime
Jul 16 00:13:29 <e1f>	in retaliation, the chinese arrested two canadians as hostages; while meng is free on bail, they are imprisoned
Jul 16 00:14:13 <e1f>	last week, one of the canadians was denied the use of his reading glasses
Jul 16 00:14:55 <technomancy>	so much for my plan of pretending to be canadian to avoid the embarrassment of being associated with the US =\
Jul 16 00:15:01 <technomancy>	time to brush up on my NZ accent
Jul 16 00:16:07 <aidalgol>	technomancy: We're still a client state to both the US and China, despite what we'd like the world to believe.

Jul 16 00:24:37 <e1f>	all i know about nz is what the tourism board sells me about lotr
Jul 16 00:25:28 <aidalgol>	oh god, you reminded me of the upcoming LotR TV series.

Jul 16 00:35:24 <parsnip>	please forgive my use of "literally" there
Jul 16 00:36:13 <e1f>	the license is not gpl, no it can't be included
Jul 16 00:37:57 <e1f>	ed is our competition? wow. is emacs regressing? i thought vim was
Jul 16 00:38:25 <Twylo>	ed(1) is the standard editor
Jul 16 00:38:27 <e1f>	but it's not really anymore since you can have both now. simultaneously
Jul 16 00:38:53 <e1f>	Twylo: no one is disputing that
Jul 16 00:39:21 <Plazma>	E1f you work on emacs?
Jul 16 00:40:01 <e1f>	nope. i just did the splash image you see at startup
Jul 16 00:40:05 <Twylo>	(for reference: https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.txt )
Jul 16 00:40:47 <Plazma>	Oh fancy pants haha
Jul 16 00:40:52 <johnjay>	e1f: i see that splash screen everyday when i start emacs anew
Jul 16 00:41:54 <turbofail>	inhibiting that splash screen was like the first thing i put in my .emacs
Jul 16 00:42:06 <johnjay>	oh you can do that?
Jul 16 00:42:17 *	johnjay wonders off to edit his init.el
Jul 16 00:42:23 <turbofail>	,dv inhibit-startup-screen
Jul 16 00:42:23 <fsbot>	Non-nil inhibits the startup screen.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	This is for use in your personal init file (but NOT site-start.el),
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	once you are familiar with the contents of the startup screen.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	You can customize this variable.
Jul 16 00:42:24 <fsbot>	Defined in `/usr/share/emacs/24.5/lisp/startup.elc'.
Jul 16 00:42:45 <parsnip>	turbofail: but do you have this!
Jul 16 00:42:47 <aidalgol>	e1f: last I heard, yes
Jul 16 00:42:49 <e1f>	i was going to damn you with faint praise for doing that. now i'm just going to damn you
Jul 16 00:42:50 <parsnip>	(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "turbofail")
Jul 16 00:43:13 <johnjay>	it worked!
Jul 16 00:43:19 <parsnip>	my *Messages* buffer is empty on startup
Jul 16 00:43:24 <johnjay>	as they say, das AMAZIN
Jul 16 00:43:55 <e1f>	after all the grief i went through
Jul 16 00:44:09 <parsnip>	maybe unless all packages aren't installed
Jul 16 00:44:15 <johnjay>	i saw it like every day for a month though
Jul 16 00:44:19 <johnjay>	i think i did my fair share
Jul 16 00:44:34 <johnjay>	i think i even tried to edit it one time
Jul 16 00:44:45 <johnjay>	like add a picture or text or something
Jul 16 00:45:31 <johnjay>	ah it's 'startup.el'
Jul 16 00:46:25 <parsnip>	i remember discussing that with someone trying to do that here
Jul 16 00:46:44 <Twylo>	You can customize fancy-startup-screen or something, I think
Jul 16 00:46:45 <parsnip>	like, startup.el `insert`s an image or something
Jul 16 00:46:55 <parsnip>	ah
Jul 16 00:47:13 <turbofail>	i probably lied about it being the "first" thing but it was definitely close to it
Jul 16 00:47:46 <turbofail>	my version control on it doesn't go back far enough to really tell
Jul 16 00:49:40 <e1f>	yeah, you can replace it with your own image. i needed var that to be able to test new versions
Jul 16 00:50:29 <xtifr>	I don't suppress the splash--I just start in daemon mode, which doesn't bother to display it in the first place. :)

Oct 11 20:50:24 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Have you read the documentation? (info "(elisp) Advising Functions") and/or add-function doc string would be a good start.
Oct 11 20:55:38 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, yeah I've read it, but I don't exactly get how my own function should look like
Oct 11 20:59:50 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: As described in the add-function doc string, in case of :around advice, the first argument of the advice is the original function, followed by the original function's arguments. You do your thing and call the original function somewhere from inside the advice.
Oct 11 21:00:26 *	dale doesn't have a read-password function.
Oct 11 21:00:42 *	stepnem assumes read-passwd is meant
Oct 11 21:00:45 <dale>	Ah, yes.
Oct 11 21:01:07 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, thank you! I literally just now understand what that "(lambda....) stuff in the docu means
Oct 11 21:02:43 <dale>	Yosemitesam: Ex. (defun my-read-passwd-advice (orig-fun &rest args) (unwind-protect (progn (<change frame title here>) (apply orig-fun args)) (<change frame title back here>))) (advice-add 'read-passwd :around #'my-read-passwd-advice)
Oct 11 21:03:48 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: I think if you read the info manual it's quite clear, and with examples. The doc string is a bit terse, indeed. Just an overview.
Oct 11 21:05:20 <Yosemitesam>	dale, thanks a lot! I was almost there but still missing the "%rest" :D
Oct 11 21:05:50 <dale>	Yosemitesam: I hope you typed &rest not %rest in your code. :)
Oct 11 21:06:12 <Yosemitesam>	stepnem, yeah, but I didn't find an example function in the info manual
Oct 11 21:06:18 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: In your case (orig-fun prompt &rest _args) might be more useful, as you'll need the prompt argument.
Oct 11 21:06:34 <Yosemitesam>	dale, uff... My typing is really bad today xD
Oct 11 21:07:00 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Really? The section I pointed to is full of examples.
Oct 11 21:07:02 <dale>	Yosemitesam: Oh, stepnem has good adv—er, a good tip there, I missed you were trying to look for a keyword in the password prompt.
Oct 11 21:08:02 <dale>	stepnem: (My personal convention is not to name it _args when I'm going to actually use it in the body of the function, even if just passing to apply in this case.)
Oct 11 21:08:49 <stepnem>	dale: Exactly, I was just typing that now... sorry for the confusion. Didn't realize you'll need the rest, too, anyway.
Oct 11 21:12:08 <stepnem>	Yosemitesam: Just to be completely clear in case you're actually gonna use it, the underscore shouldn't be there. It's useful to add it if you don't use the argument as a hint to Emacs byte compiler, but here it was a thinko on my part.
Oct 11 21:15:05 <Yosemitesam>	hmm okay.. Thank you guys!

Oct 11 21:38:47 <work_>	dale: 
Oct 11 21:38:47 <Yosemitesam>	dale, btw. thank you for the "unwind-protect" code! I finally got it working and this unwind-protect is really great to make it more cleanly :)
Oct 11 21:38:47 <dale>	Any CIDER users care to tell me if it really fails to complete a symbol until you've eval'ed it?  Ex. if I (def foo 'bar), but don't eval it, I don't get completion on "fo" from company-mode.
Oct 11 21:38:54 <dale>	Yosemitesam: NP
Oct 11 21:39:17 <bpalmer>	dale: defvar ?
Oct 11 21:39:25 <bpalmer>	or defalias?
Oct 11 21:39:32 <bpalmer>	or is def a new thing?
Oct 11 21:39:38 <work_>	dale: I have the NS port too (I think) but I can"t use special characters with it like ü ä ö ï as Option keys is meta key
Oct 11 21:39:56 <stepnem>	bpalmer: CIDER implies clojure I think
Oct 11 21:40:33 <dale>	bpalmer: Yup, Clojure.
Oct 11 21:40:35 <bpalmer>	Ah. I didn't know that.
Oct 11 21:40:59 <dale>	bpalmer: CIDER:Clojure::SLIME:Common Lisp.  (In my unexperienced opinion.)
Oct 11 21:41:54 <dale>	work_: Yes, AFAIK you either configure a macOS key to be an Emacs modifier, or IIRC you can set the corresponding Emacs var for the modifier key to nil and it will behave as it does in the rest of macOS.
Oct 11 21:43:16 <dale>	work_: Ex. I just set ns-right-option-modifier to nil (was 'left) and now I can do things like ⌥u u to type ü.
Oct 11 21:44:11 <dale>	work_: Note that Emacs does have at least a few ways to enter "special characters", try C-x 8 " u also enters ü, for example.  See also the TeX input method in Emacs, which seems somewhat popular.
Oct 11 21:44:43 <work_>	dale: that is exactly what I want so I can use right option as my good old AltGr key 
Oct 11 21:45:15 <dale>	work_: You know, I just did that with ns-right-option-modifier, and my left option key followed suit, which seems odd.  Check all your modifiers after setting.
Oct 11 21:47:24 <work_>	dale: but am currently using railwaycat/emacsmacport , not NS 😬
Oct 11 21:47:46 <dale>	work_: IIRC, it used to have a corresponding e.g. mac-right-option-modifier variable.
Oct 11 21:49:01 <work_>	dale: I feel like am learning Emacs all over again by switching to a MacBook Pro ... 
Oct 11 21:49:22 <dale>	work_: It's not too late, turn back.
Oct 11 21:50:22 <work_>	dale: ohh yeah... it is... My old Linux machine as too many problem lol
Oct 11 21:50:44 <work_>	dale: the machine itself, not Linux
Oct 11 21:51:15 <technomancy>	I thought macbook users just had all just given up and connected external keyboards at this point
Oct 11 21:51:37 <dale>	technomancy: Unpopular opinion: the 2019 MBP keyboard is nice.
Oct 11 21:51:47 <dale>	technomancy: *Note: statement does not include the Touch Bar which ruins the whole fucking thing.
Oct 11 21:52:11 <technomancy>	dale: that's the first positive thing I've ever heard said about it
Oct 11 21:52:40 <krux02>	I have the feeling that magit got much less usable since tha last time I updated
Oct 11 21:52:45 <dale>	technomancy: I have owned this for like four months and I have only had to take compressed air to it once!
Oct 11 21:53:04 <technomancy>	,faintpraise
Oct 11 21:53:04 <fsbot>	well...at least it's better than vimscript
Oct 11 21:53:07 <krux02>	it often takes more than 10 seconds for the magit status screen to appear.
Oct 11 21:53:22 <dale>	technomancy: I actually like the lower activation force, and the low travel doesn't bother me, as it turns out.  If you see me complaining about RSI here in a few more months, you can remind me of my words on this day.
Oct 11 21:53:58 <krux02>	When it is about RSI, I can feel it coming with me.
Oct 11 21:54:14 <krux02>	Not a problem yet, but it also doesn't feel like it is getting any better.
Oct 11 21:54:36 <krux02>	I guess the only way to hanle emacs and it's many modifiers will be pedals, like a real piano.
Oct 11 21:55:13 <krux02>	does anybody know good pedals that are not super ultra expensive?
Oct 11 21:55:53 <work_>	technomancy: am currently using the 2019 model and I like how flat the keyboard is. the low travel key...(like typing on a flat surface). I guess that's just me. 🤷‍♂️
Oct 11 21:56:28 <dale>	technomancy: See?  The tide is turning!
Oct 11 21:56:35 <technomancy>	wow, two in one month!
Oct 11 21:56:49 <dale>	technomancy: Now let me tell you about how I can't reboot my macOS machine cleanly, and how I can't search my email anymore, for some reason.
Oct 11 21:56:59 <work_>	dale: loving the Touch Bar sooo far😊
Oct 11 21:57:18 <dale>	work_: OK, that's too far.
Oct 11 21:57:19 <technomancy>	dale: I saw a screenshot that showed a mac refusing to run a program because it couldn't prove that it didn't contain malware
Oct 11 21:57:30 <technomancy>	I was like ... "buddy. I have some bad news for you about the halting problem"
Oct 11 21:57:52 <dale>	technomancy: I would find that very amusing, let me know if you run into it again.
Oct 11 21:58:17 <work_>	dale: did you face keyboard issue for the 2019 model for you to use  compressed air?
Oct 11 21:58:46 <technomancy>	dale: https://p.hagelb.org/malware.png
Oct 11 21:58:51 <dale>	Company had me install some DLP software or something on my Mac.  It installs itself to /Library/.rpc and takes up one core at all times because it gets stuck on xlsx files in a Go project's test data directory that I happen to have checked out.
Oct 11 21:58:59 <dale>	work_: Yes.
Oct 11 21:59:21 <dale>	technomancy: Oh, hm, that smells like the usual "not signed" (or maybe the new "not notarized") error.
Oct 11 21:59:37 <dale>	If I had an app bundle around with a broken signature I'd test it.
Oct 11 21:59:39 <technomancy>	dale: it's just hilarious that they think they can prove it doesn't have malware
Oct 11 21:59:43 <work_>	dale: Wow, am scared now... I though they were immune to keyboard issue so far...
Oct 11 21:59:44 <dale>	Oh, LibreOffice breaks itself every time it runs, let me try that.
Oct 11 22:00:05 <dale>	technomancy: I've never even noticed that, it is funny.  That prompt is kind of like "you want to use your computer blah blah blah press OK you know you're gonna".
Oct 11 22:00:14 <technomancy>	I mean, if they were going to block all programs containing malware, how come they still allow you to run itunes?
Oct 11 22:00:33 <dale>	technomancy: (iTunes has been removed from macOS latest release.)
Oct 11 22:00:42 <technomancy>	!!!
Oct 11 22:00:44 <technomancy>	awesome
Oct 11 22:01:44 <vvor>	krux02: Surly you ca do without the pedals http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/i/emacs_user_at_work_by_earlcolour.jpg
Oct 11 22:02:53 <didi>	I wouldn't mind more arms.
Oct 11 22:02:57 <technomancy>	wait, are you messing with me?
Oct 11 22:03:13 <dale>	technomancy: No?
Oct 11 22:03:27 <technomancy>	ah, ok, cool
Oct 11 22:03:42 <technomancy>	but they probably still allow chrome's EME malware to be installed, right?
Oct 11 22:03:50 <didi>	Sometimes I'm holding bags with both arms and I need to open the door.
Oct 11 22:04:02 <dale>	technomancy: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210200
Oct 11 22:04:54 <technomancy>	dale: oh, so they just rebranded it; there's still the same level of hostile DRM and debugger-suppression.
Oct 11 22:05:20 <didi>	Apple Books, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts... I see from where GNOME got the idea of their program's names.
Oct 11 22:05:32 <krux02>	technomancy: probably some malware is written using emacs
Oct 11 22:06:00 <krux02>	maybe some malware writer is here in the chat room asking for help and nobody knows it.
Oct 11 22:06:07 <technomancy>	krux02: the most widely-deployed scheme program is malware
Oct 11 22:06:12 <technomancy>	probably written in emacs
Oct 11 22:06:37 <krux02>	I didn.t know that scheme programs are deployed at all.
Oct 11 22:07:59 <bpalmer>	https://tyler.io/broken/ , as was linked to on hacker news a few days ago, was an interesting rant about catalina
Oct 11 22:08:45 <technomancy>	krux02: can't find the link but it was some 90s or early 2000s windows thing
Oct 11 22:09:14 <dale>	bpalmer: I just read that this morning, it does not make me feel happy at all.
Oct 11 22:09:29 <dale>	I live in constant fear that I will accidentally accept the Catalina "software update".
Oct 11 22:11:13 <siloxid>	dale: why, is there something bad about the update?
Oct 11 22:11:23 <bremner>	dale: there's always ,,twb-fix,,
Oct 11 22:11:23 <fsbot>	Most problems can be solved by installing Debian.
Oct 11 22:11:36 <siloxid>	,proq-fix
Oct 11 22:11:36 <fsbot>	I heard proq-fix is [0] most gui problems can be fixed by installing ratpoison
Oct 11 22:11:37 <fsbot>	[1] some speed problems too
Oct 11 22:11:43 <jlf>	,jlf-fix
Oct 11 22:11:43 <fsbot>	Most problems can be solved with a Hendrick's martini
Oct 11 22:11:54 <dale>	siloxid: 1. It ends in .0.
Oct 11 22:12:01 <dale>	siloxid: 2. See above article for scary.
Oct 11 22:12:21 <siloxid>	dale: so just the usual bleeding edge wariness
Oct 11 22:12:32 <dale>	bremner: I don't recall if they even figured out how to boot Linux on a 2019 MBP.
Oct 11 22:12:37 <bremner>	heh.
Oct 11 22:12:41 <bremner>	well, you got me there
Oct 11 22:12:58 <technomancy>	obligatory https://p.hagelb.org/update.jpg
Oct 11 22:12:59 <dale>	siloxid: I suppose so.  Someone posted a link to a Gist here the other day where people are trying to figure out how to give Emacs the permission it needs to edit... files.
Oct 11 22:13:23 <siloxid>	dale: huh. does the built-in emacs have the same issue?
Oct 11 22:13:26 <didi>	technomancy: Nice.
Oct 11 22:13:43 <dale>	siloxid: There is no more built-in Emacs with macOS, I've heard.
Oct 11 22:13:50 <siloxid>	ewww
Oct 11 22:14:53 <bpalmer>	rudybot: fix these folks a nice martini
Oct 11 22:14:54 <rudybot>	bpalmer: let's pursue our quest for the perfect martini
Oct 11 22:15:33 <siloxid>	wow, good thing I was in here. I've been hoping to upgrade all of last week
Oct 11 22:15:46 <mns>	dale: there is a built-in emacs in macOS, its just stuck at version 22.  
Oct 11 22:15:59 <bpalmer>	mns: is that the case for the new macOS, catalina?
Oct 11 22:16:20 <bpalmer>	10.15, I guess
Oct 11 22:16:41 <mns>	bpalmer: I've not upgraded to catalina yet.  I still have to get to mojave.  I'm on 10.13
Oct 11 22:18:38 <krux02>	you can always install Linux on a mac book. This will provide you with up to date OpenGL drivers.
Oct 11 22:19:38 <dale>	mns: They supposedly removed it from Catalina.
Oct 11 22:20:03 <mns>	bpalmer: so just verified via folks in osx channel.  emacs 22.1.1 has been removed from macOS catalina
Oct 11 22:21:00 <mns>	dale:  yes you are correct.  not that I used it much anyway.  I had emacs installed via brew.
Oct 11 22:21:34 <bpalmer>	that's a shame. 22 was a decent vintage.
Oct 11 22:21:35 <dale>	OK, smells like you can boot Linux on a MBP with a T2 chip if you disable secure boot.
Oct 11 22:28:12 <siloxid>	seems odd to me that you would pay all that money for a MBP just to run linux on it when you have such amazing ASUS laptops out there
Oct 11 22:28:29 <siloxid>	but to each their own, and apple did make an amazing laptop in 2013
Oct 11 22:28:43 <technomancy>	also the aluminum G4 was pretty good
Oct 11 22:29:46 <bpalmer>	the macbook air from around that timeframe was great.
Oct 11 22:31:31 <dale>	siloxid: I agree.
Oct 11 23:03:25 <foggyboi>	just upgraded to catalina and I can save stuff in emacs still so… not too scary lol
Oct 11 23:14:07 <didi>	,channel-wisdom
Oct 11 23:14:07 <fsbot>	The SPC key and the ~/.spacemacs completely replaced my need to know anything about emacs.
Oct 11 23:14:34 <didi>	,doom-emacs
Oct 11 23:14:35 <fsbot>	hmm, Doom is [0] at https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs

Oct 11 23:16:07 <bpalmer>	rudybot: you have brought doom upon us all
Oct 11 23:16:09 <rudybot>	bpalmer: or perhaps brought on by the doom theme I'm using (doom-vibrant)
Oct 11 23:17:15 <didi>	Let's implement a 2.5 D tab.

Oct 11 23:24:10 <dale>	foggyboi: Curious if you have SIP on?  And have you tried saving under, say, ~/Documents?
Oct 11 23:24:39 <dale>	dto: That looks really nice.
Oct 11 23:24:52 <dto>	dale: thanks :) it's getting there. 
Oct 11 23:25:13 <dto>	it doesn't entirely work yet. the left most voice works but not polyphony (yet)
Oct 11 23:55:04 <Allos>	Hi, how do I get org-class to show a specific time range on the agenda?
Oct 11 23:56:23 <foggyboi>	dale uhhhh let's see lol
Oct 11 23:56:50 <dale>	foggyboi: If you don't know you've turned it off, which requires booting into recovery and running some commands, then you should have it on.  It's not terribly easy to turn off.
Oct 11 23:56:54 <foggyboi>	dale hahaha yeah not permitted but I probably just need to enable /usr/bin/ruby since I think I'm using that launcher
Oct 11 23:57:12 <dale>	foggyboi: Oh, you mean writing to that dir, gotcha.
Oct 11 23:57:25 <foggyboi>	yeah i'm not having problems saving generally
Oct 11 23:57:34 <foggyboi>	adium isn't auto scrolling tho so I might throw my laptop hahaha
Oct 12 00:04:52 <didi>	So apparently "reaction video" is a popular genre on youtube. Every music search comes with tons of them.
Oct 12 00:05:51 <bpalmer>	might depend on the music you're searching for
Oct 12 00:06:06 <didi>	I guess.
Oct 12 00:06:16 <bpalmer>	but yeah. Sometimes I even enjoy watching reaction videos
Oct 12 00:08:38 <didi>	I like to explore covers.
Oct 12 00:12:29 <bpalmer>	rudybot: nothing's better than curling up under the covers on a cold winter day and reading your TAOCP
Oct 12 00:12:40 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Must be one of those Canadian winter sports -- doughnut curling
Oct 12 00:13:15 <didi>	Have you actually read TAOCP? I tried. Head still hurts.
Oct 12 00:17:14 <bpalmer>	I have read parts. 
Oct 12 00:18:41 <didi>	I couldn't go moar than a few pages.
Oct 12 00:30:33 <turbofail>	yay my sound works again
Oct 12 00:31:19 <didi>	*pulseaudio flashback*
Oct 12 00:31:30 <turbofail>	can't blame this one on pulseaudio, the damn thing wasn't even showing up in lspci for a while
Oct 12 00:31:46 <turbofail>	a kernel update fixed it

Oct 12 12:33:18 <roadie>	oh I could run a macro that kills the region, enters the tag, yanks the killed region, enters the end tag and done - too easy
Oct 12 12:46:01 <afidegnum>	hello, what best utility to visualize diagrams in emacs? CEDET seems old
Oct 12 12:48:58 <bremner>	I guess you can just get your favorite tool to generate svg or pdf and view that?
Oct 12 12:49:54 <afidegnum>	i m also having another issue with svg
Oct 12 12:50:19 <afidegnum>	svg can't be clicked/interracted 
Oct 12 12:50:39 <bremner>	I can recommend inkscape
Oct 12 12:56:28 <afidegnum>	is there an inkscape plugin for emacs?
Oct 12 13:00:07 <bremner>	not that I'm aware of
Oct 12 13:01:31 <afidegnum>	i m stucked to visualizing diagram and interracting with diagrams in emacs
Oct 12 13:01:55 <afidegnum>	i came accross plantuml but the svg output can't be modified
Oct 12 13:02:43 <bremner>	yeah, it's like most textual diagram generators in that sense
Oct 12 13:02:51 <bremner>	I guess dot is the rare exception
Oct 12 13:03:09 <bremner>	plantml seems decent, if you must work with UML
Oct 12 13:03:12 <str1ngs>	I've used org-brain for this sorta thing. but I guess that's if you generate the images
Oct 12 13:03:18 <bremner>	err, plantuml
Oct 12 13:03:56 <bremner>	afidegnum: you can't interactively modify the pdf output from latex either, at least not in emacs
Oct 12 13:04:11 <afidegnum>	then i have to look for another methods interracting with teh daigram, 
Oct 12 13:04:13 <bremner>	people still seem to find it useful
Oct 12 13:04:35 <afidegnum>	maybe via cli or editing the generated file.... 
Oct 12 13:05:07 <str1ngs>	I wrote a cli tool named via :P
Oct 12 13:05:20 <afidegnum>	i have also come accross artist mode... but way far from what i need
Oct 12 13:05:32 <afidegnum>	str1ngs: url ?
Oct 12 13:05:59 <str1ngs>	via-android/
Oct 12 13:06:06 <str1ngs>	https://github.com/mrosset/via
Oct 12 13:06:06 <afidegnum>	ah ok
Oct 12 13:06:36 <str1ngs>	last link is more appropriate. it's kinda offtopic to your issue though 
Oct 12 13:06:41 <bremner>	afidegnum: I think it's fair to say interactive graphics is not really emacs's strength
Oct 12 13:07:14 <bremner>	people do fun things as demos, but it's very much the bear on the bicyle
Oct 12 13:07:17 <str1ngs>	with org-brain I just had it export on write. so kinda interactive I guess
Oct 12 13:07:20 <bremner>	bicycle
Oct 12 13:07:42 <bremner>	str1ngs: I was thinking of click and drag graphics elements
Oct 12 13:08:09 <bremner>	rudybot: it's not that bear is good at riding the bicycle
Oct 12 13:08:13 <str1ngs>	there is that. but I did'nt want to assume that's the workflow he means
Oct 12 13:08:29 <afidegnum>	we need to add some interractive graphics in emacs to make it complete, there is a need for that
Oct 12 13:08:38 <rudybot>	bremner: the thing about a bear riding a bicycle is not that it rides well...
Oct 12 13:09:09 <bremner>	afidegnum: or we could just use other tools for those tasks. It's not like core emacs is overflowing with contributors.
Oct 12 13:09:22 <bremner>	and there something like 30k open bugs
Oct 12 13:09:48 <str1ngs>	one bug for every year of emacs existence :P
Oct 12 13:09:49 <afidegnum>	ah, bad :)
Oct 12 13:28:19 <afidegnum>	bremner: i m getting something up
Oct 12 13:28:32 <afidegnum>	how to integrate gtk or qt into emacs?
Oct 12 13:28:47 <afidegnum>	or any similar graphic engine
Oct 12 13:28:56 <bremner>	how about "why" before "how"?
Oct 12 13:29:36 <afidegnum>	so i can do the graphical interractions on them..... 
Oct 12 13:36:17 <afidegnum>	isn't emacs built in gtk+ ?
Oct 12 13:36:33 <bremner>	sortof
Oct 12 13:36:54 <afidegnum>	so we can use some gtk libraries in emacs, right ?
Oct 12 13:36:57 <bremner>	it doesn't use gtk "cleanly" afaiu
Oct 12 13:37:05 <afidegnum>	oh
Oct 12 13:37:07 <bremner>	emacs is also buildable without gtk
Oct 12 13:37:47 <afidegnum>	ok
Oct 12 13:38:04 <afidegnum>	i just want to have an additional buffer in gtk or any other graphic engine
Oct 12 14:13:28 <str1ngs>	in nomad the extensible web browser a gtk buffer is a thing :)
Oct 12 14:15:15 <str1ngs>	and probably using cairo could be interactive
Oct 12 14:30:46 <afidegnum>	str1ngs: cairo? isn't that python?
Oct 12 14:35:09 <str1ngs>	cairo is gtk's vector graphics library
Oct 12 14:35:35 <str1ngs>	probably though clutter would be better to use. since it would have event and inputs
Oct 12 14:36:49 <str1ngs>	in nomad svg is supported by default. but as a webview. webview's in nomad are first order buffers
Oct 12 14:37:14 <str1ngs>	nomad is an extensible web browser. modeled like emacs
Oct 12 14:38:33 <afidegnum>	thanks for the enlightenment, let me add more cofee... and energy drinks:)
Oct 12 14:40:25 <str1ngs>	alternatively maybe an emacs module that used GTK to display a GTK window, which you could manipulate with emacs. but last I played with emacs modules and gtk. it was a bitch due to threading
Oct 12 14:40:38 <str1ngs>	and some GTK people yelled at me for the attempt :P
Oct 12 14:41:00 <str1ngs>	s/bitch/PITA/
Oct 12 14:41:32 <str1ngs>	and so I created nomad instead
Oct 12 14:42:51 <str1ngs>	what would be even better. is gobject introspetion binding for emacs
Oct 12 14:43:46 <afidegnum>	 ah, congrats... let me volupteously study it explore it
Oct 12 14:43:50 <str1ngs>	then you could write whole GTK programs in elisp :)
Oct 12 14:44:08 <str1ngs>	afidegnum: it's still pretty experimental
Oct 12 14:44:51 <afidegnum>	dsl?
Oct 12 14:44:52 <fsbot>	From memory, DSL is [0] domain-specific language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language> ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 12 14:45:03 <str1ngs>	right now I'm porting nomad to g-golf which is very early work. g-golf is guile bindings for gobject instrospection. nomad uses guile for it's extension language
Oct 12 14:46:58 <afidegnum>	well, let me dip my head, i believe i m closer to what i m looking for
Oct 12 14:48:22 <str1ngs>	http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/nomad/ has an alpha release
Oct 12 14:49:08 <str1ngs>	but the feature-g-golf http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/nomad.git/log/?h=feature-g-golf. has much better GTK support
Oct 12 14:49:32 <afidegnum>	no github?
Oct 12 14:50:25 <str1ngs>	I have a github mirror yes
Oct 12 14:50:40 <afidegnum>	i would like to explore the source code
Oct 12 14:50:53 <str1ngs>	http://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/nomad.git/tree/scheme/nomad/webview.scm?h=feature-g-golf#n64
Oct 12 14:51:33 <afidegnum>	good
Oct 12 14:51:43 <str1ngs>	here is an example of a gtk widget as a first order buffer. https://github.com/mrosset/nomad/blob/feature-g-golf/scheme/nomad/webview.scm#L64
Oct 12 14:52:08 <str1ngs>	also https://github.com/mrosset/nomad/blob/feature-g-golf/scheme/nomad/text.scm#L44
Oct 12 14:52:34 <str1ngs>	and as a caveat. this is all still highly WIP
Oct 12 14:52:44 <afidegnum>	so mostly webview ?
Oct 12 14:53:55 <str1ngs>	well nomad is a web browser first, so webviews are the most mature. though text-buffer use gtksourceview's and are surprisingly use able with emacs bindings etc
Oct 12 14:54:22 <afidegnum>	ok, let me loook into it, 
Oct 12 14:54:53 <str1ngs>	I use something called emacsy which is guile library for creating emacs like programs
Oct 12 14:55:52 <str1ngs>	also there is #nomad-browser if you need support
Oct 12 14:56:39 <afidegnum>	good
Oct 12 14:57:05 <afidegnum>	i remember of guile, when i was reading scheme... but didn't pay attention much
Oct 12 15:08:11 <hodapp>	rudybot: I thought that eating cold fried fish was just a strange, gross Jewish tradition but I have to admit that cold whitefish with horseradish on toast is actually quite good.
Oct 12 15:08:28 <rudybot>	hodapp: gets a bagel with whitefish
Oct 12 15:10:58 <afidegnum>	seen wasamasa ?
Oct 12 15:11:32 <afidegnum>	he also did something on graphics on emacs i can remember
Oct 12 15:20:22 <bremner>	afidegnum: his was exactly the bear on a bicycle demo I was thinking of
Oct 12 15:20:34 <afidegnum>	:)
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	I have a certain workflow and it provokes certain problems. They are certainly newbie problems for my lack of the basic knowledge needed to solve them. I will describe one of my workflows and problems related to it below.
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	Everyday I start Emacs on Gnome by way of Super and then type: em <RET> .
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	Then: M-x erc-tl <TAB> <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:27 <quiliro>	After that: <RET> <RET> <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:30 <quiliro>	Then my password and <RET>
Oct 12 15:22:33 <quiliro>	So the chatrooms are openned automatically...the ones that were open the previous night before closing Emacs, when I typed C-c C-x on the IRC server buffer.
Oct 12 15:22:41 <quiliro>	Sorry for the long message
Oct 12 15:23:24 <dzho>	cool story so far
Oct 12 15:25:01 <quiliro>	One of my problems it that the rooms are not the ones I defined to be open on the custumization of ERC, but the ones I had open when closing IRC connection.
Oct 12 15:25:10 <bremner>	does anyone know if the width of org-mode text export is configurable?
Oct 12 15:25:28 <bremner>	I want paragraphs without hard line breaks in org text export
Oct 12 15:25:38 <bremner>	because idiotic web systems
Oct 12 15:26:13 <quiliro>	The other problem with ERC is that I would want this process to be done automatically.
Oct 12 15:27:48 <bremner>	https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34901/orgmode-exporting-to-text-without-wrapping looks like an answer, let me try it out
Oct 12 15:27:51 <roadie>	can I append more than one defun to a mode add-hook? or do I type a line for each?
Oct 12 15:27:51 <quiliro>	And the last problem with ERC is that several versions of log files will create for each chatroom, if I reconnect without closing all chatrooms and IRC buffer.
Oct 12 15:29:30 <bremner>	,df add-hook
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	add-hook is a compiled Lisp function in `subr.el'.
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	(add-hook HOOK FUNCTION &optional APPEND LOCAL)
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
Oct 12 15:29:31 <fsbot>	FUNCTION is not added if already present. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 12 15:29:39 <bremner>	one at a time, it loks like
Oct 12 15:36:47 <bandali>	hey bremner, how’s it going?
Oct 12 15:37:23 <bremner>	bandali: a bit better. You want to try to chat at some point today about emacsconf?
Oct 12 15:37:51 <bandali>	bremner, :) your deadline was yesterday, yeah? hopefully you’ve recovered some
Oct 12 15:38:09 <bandali>	and sure, that’d be nice. feel free to ping me in #emacsconf whenever you feel like it
Oct 12 15:40:13 <roadie>	thanks bremner 
Oct 12 15:41:55 <afidegnum>	is cairo in emacs 26 enabled by default or i need to compile emacs with it ?

Oct 13 19:29:20 <afidegnum>	hello, anyone successfully installed plantuml and emacs? i m confused about the installation, i need a hand. 
Oct 13 19:30:57 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: all I did was place the jar into my path
Oct 13 19:31:50 <wasamasa>	just don't place the jar into your mouth
Oct 13 19:31:51 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: then I added it to org-babel-load-languages and (setq org-plantuml-jar-path
Oct 13 19:31:54 <C-Keen>	      (expand-file-name "~/bin/plantuml.jar"))
Oct 13 19:36:10 <afidegnum>	C-Keen: $PATH ?
Oct 13 19:41:42 <C-Keen>	afidegnum: ~/bin/ is in my $PATH but it seems that for org-mode I needed to specify its location explicitly. IDK why I did that
Oct 13 19:46:07 <johnjay>	is clojure basically a lisp machine built on top of the JRE instead of i386?
Oct 13 19:46:38 <johnjay>	ever since wasa mentioned how CCL isn't turing complete i've been thinking of everythin as a Virtual Machine
Oct 13 19:50:19 <technomancy>	johnjay: no, lisp machines are big into self-hosting which the JVM is entirely uninterested in
Oct 13 19:51:38 <hodapp>	running the JVM inside the JVM would seem a bit silly
Oct 13 20:12:22 <johnjay>	self-hosting just means a compiler can compile itself right?
Oct 13 20:12:31 <johnjay>	emacs is lisp on top of C so idk it fits that definition
Oct 13 20:12:42 <wasamasa>	it doesn't
Oct 13 20:13:15 <wasamasa>	the byte-code compiler cannot spit out an extensible text editor
Oct 13 20:20:32 <wasamasa>	well, perhaps you could argue that specific thing is
Oct 13 20:21:16 <wasamasa>	if you are using a scheme compiler written in its own language to generate a new version of that compiler, the same thing can be said about the byte-code compiler
Oct 13 20:21:33 <wasamasa>	it's written in elisp, compiles elisp and can be used to compile more elisp
Oct 13 20:30:39 <johnjay>	i was thinking you could define a lisp machine on anything in that case
Oct 13 20:30:44 <lampilelo>	hello
Oct 13 20:30:48 <johnjay>	a .net lisp machine. an arm lisp machine

Oct 18 15:49:49 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Oct 18 15:51:30 <Abbott>	I want pasted c code into a c minor mode buffer to use tabs for indentation instead of 2 spaces. which option is that?
Oct 18 15:52:29 <Abbott>	I found this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentingC#toc5
Oct 18 15:52:30 <dale>	Abbott: If the code you pasted doesn't use tabs, select the pasted code (you may be able to just hit C-x C-x) and then Probably C-M-\ to reindent.  You may need M-x tabify RET instead.
Oct 18 15:54:45 <Abbott>	dale: the code I copy does have tabs in it, but when I paste it converts everything to 2 space indentation
Oct 18 15:54:52 <Abbott>	I'll try what you just suggested
Oct 18 15:54:59 <dale>	Abbott: Huh, that seems really odd.
Oct 18 15:55:37 <dale>	Abbott: Wait, is your c-mode indentation already set up for tabs, I mean for code you just type in and such?
Oct 18 15:55:47 <Abbott>	no
Oct 18 15:56:04 <dale>	Oh.  Then you want C code, period, to indent with tabs, including C code that you might paste.
Oct 18 15:56:22 <Abbott>	right, sorry
Oct 18 15:56:45 <Abbott>	question came out kind of clunky
Oct 18 15:57:45 <dale>	Abbott: NP.  Try setting indent-tabs-mode to non-nil in c-mode.  You may also need to set tab-width to something other than the default 8.
Oct 18 15:58:30 <dale>	Abbott: cc-mode (which includes c-mode and other modes for "C-like" languages) indentation is more configurable than many other Emacs modes.  Full documentation starts around https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ccmode.html#Indentation-Engine-Basics I believe.
Oct 18 15:58:37 <trafaret1>	bandali: big thanks  this is standart binding for erc :) 
Oct 18 15:59:25 <trafaret1>	bandali: C-c C-b :)
Oct 18 15:59:26 <bandali>	trafaret1, cheers :)
Oct 18 15:59:37 <dale>	Abbott: I'm struggling to remember the high points of cc-mode indentation, as I don't use it as often as I'd like.  I think c-basic-offset will be important, you'll probably want this to equal tab-width (change tab-width to equal c-basic-offset or vice versa).
Oct 18 16:00:39 <bandali>	trafaret1, indeed, C-c C-b is bound in erc, but not outside :) so i just bind it (though to a different binding) globally as well
Oct 18 16:00:54 <bandali>	the M-a was inspired by weechat’s
Oct 18 16:00:56 <dale>	Abbott: See also variables c-default-style and c-style-alist.  Both mentioned in above documentation.  But something like (setq indent-tabs-mode t tab-width 4 c-basic-offset 4) in a mode hook should at least get you started.
Oct 18 16:02:18 <Abbott>	okay, thank you very much for all this
Oct 18 16:02:32 <Abbott>	I'll thumb through this and see if I can get some configs properly set up

Oct 18 16:11:24 <bandali>	trafaret1, hmm, possibly? i’m personally not aware of any
Oct 18 16:11:35 <bandali>	actually, there’s bitlbee

Oct 18 16:12:36 <trafaret1>	bandali: ok, I know about bitlbee but I don't want to send my personal data from other client to 3 side 
Oct 18 16:16:01 <olivuser>	hello emacs.
Oct 18 16:16:36 <olivuser>	I would like to define custom types for org-agenda-custom-command. is that possible? I am curious, because the docstring seems to suggest it is, yet with arbitrary type naming I seem to not be successful
Oct 18 16:17:14 <cnx>	sorry for interupting, how do i have different styles for C (linux) and C++ (GNU)
Oct 18 16:17:35 <cnx>	currently i have (setq c-default-style "linux") in my config
Oct 18 16:22:53 <TreyHarris>	So I just was looking at the Ediff manual for something, and it's one of those annoying Emacs manuals that list only keybinds and not function names (so, if you have rebinding, you don't know what it's talking about). And the keys it suggests for the things I want to do aren't doing anything for me. The weird things, though, are that a) searching my configs, I don't have anything named `.*ediff.*` rebound, so
Oct 18 16:22:55 <TreyHarris>	I don't know why those default keys wouldn't work, and b) since Ediff has its own buffer with its own keymap that uses mostly unchorded commands, why is a key that the manual says should do something, like `@` or `*`, unbound (not bound to self-insert)?
Oct 18 16:23:31 <TreyHarris>	olivuser: see https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.html
Oct 18 16:24:45 <cnx>	oops i found it in the manual, just use hooks is enough
Oct 18 16:25:08 <shrysr>	How can i understand/get started using ctags/etags (??) in my emacs workflow? I predominantly work with R/python and org files tangled to scripts (where necessary)... 
Oct 18 16:26:10 <cnx>	wait i need not, c-defaut-style support per-file
Oct 18 16:26:12 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: And oldie but a goodie: http://blog.binchen.org/posts/how-to-use-ctags-in-emacs-effectively-3.html
Oct 18 16:26:55 <bandali>	trafaret1, right; then i’m not sure
Oct 18 16:28:13 <_thelion_>	Nevermind: I was able to solve it on my own ;)
Oct 18 16:29:09 <olivuser>	TreyHarris, thanks, but I am wondering specifically how to write a user-defined function (other than agenda, alltodo, todo etc), a possibility talked about in 3) of custom command configuration
Oct 18 16:29:14 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: ty that is helpful. i was also wondering - how are the tags more useful than a full text search ?
Oct 18 16:30:49 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: more useful? They aren't, on their own. But they're much faster.
Oct 18 16:31:18 <TreyHarris>	Well, technically they can support metadata like cross-references, but few actually do that
Oct 18 16:32:10 <TreyHarris>	If your files are cached in memory or on a fast SSD, if the fileset's small enough, it probably doesn't matter, though the tags commands are designed to be more quick-access
Oct 18 16:32:59 <TreyHarris>	olivuser:I see. I don't know, you might try on #org-mode (but be aware that replies there often take a few hours)
Oct 18 16:35:19 <TreyHarris>	shrysr: I believe all the IDE-like packages that let you jump between calls and definitions and inclusions and libraries, etc., work via tags or some proprietary (in the non-anti-open-source sense) caching mechanism, though some may fall back to plaintext searching project files on disk?
Oct 18 16:36:36 <sachac>	olivuser: You've probably come across https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8wohqz/completely_custom_orgagenda_with_support_for_gtd/ already, right?
Oct 18 16:39:05 <olivuser>	sachac, no I havent, thanks a bunch :)
Oct 18 16:39:50 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: hmm , i'm not sure about other IDE's, as Rstudio is the only one that i use very occassionally..kindda never look at anything other emacs sinec some years. THe issue for me with org mode so far was the jumping is between headlines and not functions variables, unless I C-c ' on a source block 
Oct 18 16:40:25 <olivuser>	also sorry for my "tone", didnt mean to be rude, dear fellows
Oct 18 16:40:52 <shrysr>	sachac: hello! your posts inspired me to get into emacs years ago.

Oct 18 16:44:34 <JordiGH>	bbuccianti: For what?
Oct 18 16:44:53 <bbuccianti>	for being graced with my presence
Oct 18 16:44:53 <JordiGH>	Now, who wants to talk rms drama?
Oct 18 16:44:56 <shrysr>	TreyHarris: the problem I face nowadays seems to be a balance betwee 'literate programming' and directly writing scripts with comments ... as both functions and projects get longer, its started becoming an issue. I think i inserted a tag within a source block by mistake some days ago and have been trying to find out more since then. i'm trying to figure out an easier way.  
Oct 18 16:45:02 <sachac>	JordiGH: Hah, I'm procrastinating working on my presentation for EmacsConf. Every so often, I get the "Aaaah! I don't know what I'm talking about!" imposter thing. =)

Oct 18 16:45:59 <sachac>	olivuser: There's a link to some implementation code there that looks pretty neat. =) I hope that helps you dig into the details of making your own agenda command. The example makes me want to write something like that too!
Oct 18 16:46:30 <bbuccianti>	I think JordiGH wants to appear on one of you interviews sachac
Oct 18 16:46:52 <JordiGH>	No drama? Anyone?
Oct 18 16:46:57 <JordiGH>	Fine.
Oct 18 16:47:02 <sachac>	bbuccianti: I should've done one when he visited!
Oct 18 16:47:30 <sachac>	Oh well. I'll probably be able to start them up again next year, when the kiddo starts going to school.
Oct 18 16:48:53 <bbuccianti>	sachac: interviews are coming back next year?
Oct 18 16:48:58 <bbuccianti>	awesome!
Oct 18 16:48:58 <olivuser>	sachac, to be honest it kinda made me freak out, since I'm quite new to elisp and to programming in general. What you did was show me there's some way to go and that I have to find a solution in the meantime (also a good thing^^)
Oct 18 16:49:14 <bandali>	wasamasa, you around?
Oct 18 16:49:52 <sachac>	olivuser: Mmm... Could you tell me more about the custom agendas you'd like to make? You might be able to get away with the built-in types, especially with some clever skipping.
Oct 18 16:50:17 <JordiGH>	Goign to school already? Geez, time flies.
Oct 18 16:51:01 <olivuser>	sachac, well, for me it is mainly about the block separators. I want to have about four block separators, and that proves to be kind of impossible if I dont define new types and/or rethink the way I want the different entries to be sorted
Oct 18 16:51:42 <olivuser>	essentially, I want: "Appointments" | "Now" and "Today" | "Tomorrow" | "Later" | "Some day"
Oct 18 16:52:56 <shrysr>	doesnt org-super-agenda help do this ^
Oct 18 17:01:06 <wasamasa>	bandali: just got off from work
Oct 18 17:01:46 <bandali>	wasamasa, ha :)
Oct 18 17:01:49 <bandali>	please pin my latest /r/emacs ann whenever you get a chance
Oct 18 17:01:59 <olivuser>	shrysr, for me, it doesnt. I already use org-super-agenda, but I have been unable to get it to work.

Oct 19 21:57:46 <RatS_Rule>	my question is how to format with two variables like in the first pastebin 'cause when i try like this (format qubes-copy file) it ends with "not enought argument"
Oct 19 21:58:26 <RatS_Rule>	*qvm-copy needs ...
Oct 19 21:59:17 <dale>	RatS_Rule: (format qubes-copy-to-vm arg1 arg2)
Oct 19 22:00:12 <dale>	RatS_Rule: In general, first arg to format is the format string, and each %s in the format string (or other % formatting, see docs) needs one argument following that first arg.  It's like printf, if you know C.
Oct 19 22:09:06 <RatS_Rule>	ok i stills end with errors when i try to use variables like this https://pastebin.com/raw/zVj5F7LR
Oct 19 22:13:25 <dale>	RatS_Rule: Does that *exact* code yield an error?  If yes, can you tell me what the error is?  If no, can you post the exact code that does give you an error, and also what that error is?
Oct 19 22:14:20 <RatS_Rule>	this do an error : not enought arguments 
Oct 19 22:16:02 <RatS_Rule>	when i put file in ( ) it's a symbol's function definition : void
Oct 19 22:17:01 <dale>	RatS_Rule: The exact code in your last URL works without error for me.  Are you sure the "not enough arguments" error is coming from Emacs and not from qvm-copy?  (I created a dummy shell script to stand in for qvm-copy, which I do not have.)
Oct 19 22:17:06 *	parsnip throws the rubber duck in a random direction.
Oct 19 22:17:51 *	dale calls PETRA.
Oct 19 22:19:56 <RatS_Rule>	the exact error is "not enought arguments for format string" so i except it comes from emacs; also the second pastebin works well; also i double check for C-x C-e defun and defvar ...
Oct 19 22:22:31 *	parsnip shouts, "it wasn't me!", as a rubber animal collides elastically with dale's head moments later.
Oct 19 22:55:14 <RatS_Rule>	well it seems i needed to restart emacs; for an unknow reasons my var was stuck in a previous form, thank youfor your patience dale 
Oct 19 23:00:14 <dale>	NP
Oct 19 23:12:06 <parsnip>	Welp, I think I'm just over this cafe, don't want to bother with this anymore.
Oct 19 23:12:32 <parsnip>	Hmm, hotspot would fix it, but I'm just ready for a walk anyways.
Oct 19 23:47:59 <parsnip>	offby1: i don't understand this Seattle reputation, for "passive aggressive", and "Seattle freeze".
Oct 19 23:49:42 <offby1>	me neither tbh
Oct 19 23:49:57 <offby1>	maybe I'm passive aggressive and chilly myself, so I don't notice
Oct 19 23:52:40 <bremner>	that kind of attitude is OK for some.
Oct 19 23:56:07 <edgar-rft>	I'd prefer to be actively aggessive, you assholes!
Oct 19 23:57:46 <Blackbeard[m]>	It is amazing how I've used Emacs for years now
Oct 19 23:57:48 <Blackbeard[m]>	And I still feel like I barely know it
Oct 19 23:58:18 <Blackbeard[m]>	Org-capture and org-protocol are amazing
Oct 20 00:01:17 <offby1>	tried M-x calc yet?
Oct 20 00:08:49 <Blackbeard[m]>	Oh yes, but only for the minimal, trivial multiplication or sums
Oct 20 00:08:55 <Blackbeard[m]>	Nothing fancy
Oct 20 00:09:28 <Blackbeard[m]>	I use stumpwm so basically I only use Emacs and firefox
Oct 20 00:09:48 <Blackbeard[m]>	I have been slowly changing everything to emacs
Oct 20 00:10:18 <work_>	dale: hello, I finally made the "use right command/option as another modifier" working on macOS (as Super in my keys). However, I notice that when I have Sticky Keys on, which I do a lot, it doesn't work
Oct 20 00:11:24 <Blackbeard[m]>	It is beautiful knowing your workflow will stay consistent for years to come
Oct 20 00:34:09 <gnomon>	Blackbeard[m], when you get into calc-mode and org-table you are going to _love_ them
Oct 20 01:10:02 <libertyp1ime>	Hey guys. I'm looking for a way to specify an arbitrary interpreter/compiler for babel blocks. Example here: http://ix.io/1ZfL/org
Oct 20 01:10:43 <libertyp1ime>	I have something which works but requires me to specify the babel source as 'sh'. That means I can't use yasnippets for the babel and it highlights incorrectly
Oct 20 01:11:36 <libertyp1ime>	I'd like to specify the interpreter so I can put code snippets rather than full source files into babel
Oct 20 01:12:08 <libertyp1ime>	for example, with graphviz-dot I would like in the future to specify only the graph edges and skip the boilerplate
Oct 20 01:12:43 <libertyp1ime>	for java i would like to specify System.out.println instead of an entire main function, etc
Oct 20 01:13:03 <libertyp1ime>	but for all languages i would like to make script which provide the boilerplate

Nov 07 15:00:02 <drdo>	Just wondering if there was an easy way to make this faster
Nov 07 15:00:09 <drdo>	I like magit, but the speed is an issue
Nov 07 15:00:14 <quiliro>	if it is slow on the command line, it is a networking (name solving or routing) problem
Nov 07 15:00:21 <drdo>	quiliro: it's not slow on the command line
Nov 07 15:00:25 <fledermaus>	you haven't asked a specific "this" so your question isn't really answerable.
Nov 07 15:01:09 <drdo>	fledermaus: magit
Nov 07 15:01:16 <drdo>	jesus, I can give you a specific command
Nov 07 15:01:21 <drdo>	But everything is slow
Nov 07 15:01:21 <fsbot>	Try: dlgs-phrases lamport-fix lebowski-data perlis-data stallman-fact-list
Nov 07 15:01:31 <drdo>	It's not subtle
Nov 07 15:01:33 <quiliro>	drdo: did you test magit by starting emacs without any config (emacs -Q)?
Nov 07 15:01:38 <drdo>	I'm not trying to be mysterious
Nov 07 15:01:48 <drdo>	quiliro: I haven't
Nov 07 15:03:03 <quiliro>	drdo: it might be some of your configurations...with 'emacs -Q' you use no configurations to compare
Nov 07 15:03:16 <drdo>	You can take magit-status for example
Nov 07 15:03:22 <drdo>	That takes like 2seconds
Nov 07 15:03:33 <drdo>	even on a repo with a few files and a couple commits
Nov 07 15:04:21 <fledermaus>	and as I said above, you can try customising magit-status-headers-hook

Nov 07 18:50:39 <zeta_0>	dale: so what does the error mean then ?
Nov 07 18:50:52 <dale>	zeta_0: Probably forgot to close something like a paren.
Nov 07 18:51:09 <chasecrum>	is anyone in here using mu4e by any chance?
Nov 07 18:53:32 <zeta_0>	dale: yes, i was missing a parenthesis, thanks
Nov 07 18:54:51 <zeta_0>	how would i translate this into use-package ? https://hastebin.com/avinodowuv.coffeescript
Nov 07 19:01:00 <macrover>	need help with coding sys error, http://ix.io/216x
Nov 07 19:02:16 <kenrestivo>	,spook
Nov 07 19:02:17 <fsbot>	From memory, ErcSpook is at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcSpook
Nov 07 19:03:38 <thblt>	macrover: this is a very weird issue, lucky you!
Nov 07 19:03:43 <kenrestivo>	wow "janet reno"? spook is *old*
Nov 07 19:03:57 <kenrestivo>	like 25 years old
Nov 07 19:03:59 <macrover>	thblt, ha! but not comforting
Nov 07 19:04:19 <thblt>	I've never seen this, but if " (utf-8 (194982 . 4194252) (194983 . 4194177) (195019 . 4194252)" is a list of buffer positions, you may be able to actually identify the characters Emacs chokes on.
Nov 07 19:05:00 <thblt>	Or maybe character positions/characters conses?
Nov 07 19:05:00 <macrover>	thblt these are all hyphens or quote characters \ ', no foreign chars
Nov 07 19:08:02 <dale>	macrover: I'd open it in hexl-mode/xxd/od/hex editor and see what was at those positions.
Nov 07 19:08:36 <dale>	macrover: I'm hoping that right around 194982 you'll find 3F FF CC.  But I'm just guessing at how to read that error.
Nov 07 19:08:55 <quiliro>	howard-abrams: did you test with emacs -Q ?
Nov 07 19:08:56 <macrover>	2019-11-07 10:08 <dale> at that position: Yves-Marie de L'Isle André, Breton, France
Nov 07 19:09:11 <dale>	macrover: Did you read that in org-mode or in hexl-mode?
Nov 07 19:09:23 <quiliro>	maybe it is the wrong person to suggest that to :-(
Nov 07 19:09:25 <macrover>	org mode
Nov 07 19:09:34 <thblt>	macrover: what do you mean? Those values are far from \ and '
Nov 07 19:09:38 <dale>	macrover: Open it in a hex editor and see what bytes are there, I don't trust Emacs after it's opened the buffer.
Nov 07 19:09:59 <thblt>	macrover: also do you get that when saving, or at any other moment? 
Nov 07 19:10:28 <edgar-rft>	org is great, it gives us errors we've never seen before
Nov 07 19:11:06 <macrover>	thblt, you're right the char is ' over e in French. I get that error randomly while I'm doing somethign else. the file's saved properly, opens properly. The error pops as a new buffer.
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	it seems like this piece of code fixed it: `(use-package company
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	  :config
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	  (progn
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
Nov 07 19:11:10 <zeta_0>	    (global-set-key (kbd "M-/") 'company-complete-common-or-cycle)
Nov 07 19:11:11 <zeta_0>	    (setq company-idle-delay 0)))`
Nov 07 19:11:11 <dale>	For the record, I think this is standard Emacs text encoding complaint.
Nov 07 19:11:38 <dale>	The only thing I'm not sure about is why it's in " *temp file*".
Nov 07 19:11:52 <cvandusen>	zeta_0: You don't need the progn 
Nov 07 19:12:27 <macrover>	yes, I was wondering too, but some of those src_blocks in org-mode actually crate eps files for graphs; they are generated fine with no errors
Nov 07 19:12:29 <thblt>	macrover: M-x toggle-debug-on-error?  I don't know if it will help, but worth a try.
Nov 07 19:12:33 <cvandusen>	and add-hook can be written :hook (after-init . global-company-mode)
Nov 07 19:12:43 <macrover>	thblt, ok will try 
Nov 07 19:20:53 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: something, something, something
Nov 07 19:20:53 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: i could do it with browse-url just wondering if there is something better
Nov 07 19:21:02 <thblt>	The error itself seems to come from `select-safe-coding-system-interactively`
Nov 07 19:22:17 <macrover>	thblt, fwiw, the error stops when I disable helm; helm is triggering the error in the first place
Nov 07 19:22:35 <thblt>	It gets better <3
Nov 07 19:23:06 <thblt>	I love these weird errors (provided they don't happen to me)
Nov 07 19:23:22 <macrover>	thblt, ha ha, ty, bye
Nov 07 19:24:07 <thblt>	Does it really happen arbitrarily or when you try to do something?  Like it doesn't happen when Emacs is idling?
Nov 07 19:24:20 <thblt>	And if so, do you remember what you were doing?
Nov 07 19:24:23 <macrover>	only when idling
Nov 07 19:24:36 <thblt>	Not even typing?
Nov 07 19:24:37 <macrover>	it does not interrupt when I do other things
Nov 07 19:24:49 <macrover>	sometimes
Nov 07 19:25:27 <macrover>	I'm looking at autosave and other thigns happening in the background
Nov 07 19:26:42 <dale>	macrover: If you want help analyzing a stack trace, pastebin it somewhere and I'll take a look.
Nov 07 19:26:46 <dale>	Gotta admit I'm intrigued.
Nov 07 19:27:17 <thblt>	macrover: auto backups maybe?
Nov 07 19:27:33 <thblt>	Yes, Emacs is talking about temp-file
Nov 07 19:27:37 <macrover>	thblt, yes that may be it
Nov 07 19:27:51 <macrover>	got a stack trace, will paste bin it shortly
Nov 07 19:27:54 <thblt>	Hey, that's a good question, why would use a temp file?
Nov 07 19:28:00 <thblt>	what not why
Nov 07 19:29:04 <dale>	I would not be surprised if part of the process of opening a new buffer involves creating a temporary buffer with some/all of the file's content where Emacs can go nuts trying to guess the encoding and/or maybe reading prop line variables.
Nov 07 19:29:33 <macrover>	http://ix.io/216E
Nov 07 19:30:12 <dale>	Hm, OK, so " *temp file*" is from with-temp-file.
Nov 07 19:30:53 <thblt>	macrover: was this triggered from toggle-debug-on-error?
Nov 07 19:31:50 <dale>	Am I correctly reading that stack trace as a timer that fires calling save-some-buffers?
Nov 07 19:32:00 <macrover>	thblt, yes from toggle-debug-on-error
Nov 07 19:32:03 <thblt>	excellent
Nov 07 19:32:28 <dale>	Then you end up inside helm because it's trying to prompt for the encoding of /Users/sjeer/org/codingsystemerror.text...
Nov 07 19:32:30 <macrover>	dale, I traced to an autosave macro
Nov 07 19:34:12 <dale>	WTF... #f(advice-wrapper :override ivy-completing-read helm--completing-read-default)(
Nov 07 19:34:56 <dale>	Is that... read-coding-system calling completing-read-function, which may or may not be set to ivy-completing-read, but which is then ... is that ivy-completing-read being overridden with helm--completing-read-default via advice?
Nov 07 19:35:09 <macrover>	dale, don't know the wrapper thing. I wrote that autosave macro  a long time ago and don't quite know what's going on; it worked fine as a after-save hook
Nov 07 19:35:46 <macrover>	dale, perhaps -- but why now and not before?
Nov 07 19:36:01 <dale>	macrover: Oh, I haven't the foggiest what would have changed for you.
Nov 07 19:36:12 <dale>	macrover: Are you really using both Ivy and Helm?
Nov 07 19:36:14 <dale>	Maybe this is more common than I am aware.
Nov 07 19:36:30 <macrover>	I disabled the after-save hook and no more errors
Nov 07 19:37:53 <macrover>	yes, didn't know I was
Nov 07 19:38:56 <macrover>	dale now I know the source of error, ty for the help.
Nov 07 19:40:13 <dale>	macrover: NP, I wouldn't be surprised if your raw-text changes would have done the job, but they didn't help because save-buffer was being interrupted by an error trying to prompt you about encoding.
Nov 07 19:57:03 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: is there a noodle in your poodle?
Nov 07 19:57:08 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: rudel poodle strudel
Nov 07 19:57:42 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: you're going nuts now?
Nov 07 19:57:43 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: If we don't do something now to protect them they're just going to be hunted by those right wing gun nuts.
Nov 07 19:58:02 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: you're wandering off the point
Nov 07 19:58:03 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I'm using the variable width setup with circe and while it works great, I notice point sometimes wandering off
Nov 07 19:58:22 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: don't beat around the bush!

Dec 08 17:44:26 <Lordveda>	Hello People
Dec 08 17:45:05 <Lordveda>	Does Centaur Emacs have a specific room on irc.freenode.net
Dec 08 17:45:06 <Lordveda>	??
Dec 08 17:45:07 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Dec 08 17:45:46 <bremner>	Lordveda: never heard of it. Did you try asking alis the bot?
Dec 08 17:46:11 <Lordveda>	No, because I don't know about it
Dec 08 17:46:23 <bremner>	Now I know how those grumpy old debian developers feel about all of the derivative distros. Oh wait...
Dec 08 17:46:45 <Lordveda>	I don't use debian :)
Dec 08 17:46:48 <bremner>	rudybot: there are DDs way grumpier than me, honest.
Dec 08 17:46:52 <rudybot>	bremner: Is it just me, or has the channel been grumpier than usual lately?

On the Day of Resurrection your EMACS will resolve for them their differences.
Dec 08 17:54:19 <phil1751>	Hello, what is a regex which does not match a specific sub-string like 'xyz' ? 
Dec 08 17:54:45 <wasamasa>	there is no such thing
Dec 08 17:54:49 <wasamasa>	not in elisp anyway
Dec 08 17:59:06 <q[corwin]>	Multi-stage external filter was intimidating as hell to setup but smell is gone asap.
Dec 08 17:59:59 <edgar-rft>	I think the regex "abc" wouldn't match the substring "xyz".
Dec 08 18:33:03 <lxbarbosa>	well, that makes sense. :)
Dec 08 19:06:38 <dto>	emacs 27 sure has a bumper crop of fancy new thingies this time around!
Dec 08 19:06:45 <dto>	backtrace-mode pop ups
Dec 08 19:06:51 <dto>	so cool!
Dec 08 19:06:57 <dto>	tab bars
Dec 08 19:06:58 <dto>	tab lines
Dec 08 19:07:32 <dto>	improved minibuffer pretty printing of EIEIO objects!
Dec 08 19:08:07 <shapr>	is emacs 27 released?
Dec 08 19:08:12 <bremner>	no
Dec 08 19:08:22 <dto>	nope i'm using 27.0.50 from git head.
Dec 08 19:09:57 <dto>	also it seems snappier and more responsive in general.
Dec 08 19:10:00 <bremner>	releases are for old people.
Dec 08 19:10:08 <dto>	improved EIEIO linting
Dec 08 19:10:25 <dto>	so much fancyness and schmancyness
Dec 08 19:10:37 <dto>	i couldn't even finish the news fiile, it got late
Dec 08 19:10:42 <dto>	how ru bremner 
Dec 08 19:11:28 <bremner>	I've never even been to ru!
Dec 08 19:11:34 <dto>	heh
Dec 08 19:11:35 <dto>	;)
Dec 08 19:11:53 <dto>	sorry to use SMS-speak on IRC. i guess it is a faux pas
Dec 08 19:12:12 <bremner>	yeah. better than a real pas though
Dec 08 19:12:30 <dto>	(play-sound "drumroll.wav")
Dec 08 19:12:32 <dto>	;)
Dec 08 19:23:25 <dto>	Emacs is like frigging Unicron at this point. it should be voiced by Orson Welles.
Dec 08 19:26:34 <dto>	imagine Orson Welles saying "Buffer has no process."
Dec 08 19:26:48 <dto>	or "Command attempted to use minibuffer while in minibuffer"
Dec 08 19:39:56 <notzmv>	nice
Dec 08 19:41:54 <bremner>	are you calling emacs fat?
Dec 08 19:53:33 <winny>	my emacs is fat
Dec 08 20:07:06 <JordiGH>	Hm, there's no fancier Emacs SQL mode out here?
Dec 08 20:09:57 <bbuccianti>	,help
Dec 08 20:09:57 <fsbot>	bbuccianti, help is PM me and type help-erbot
Dec 08 20:13:04 <kensanata>	JordiGH: There used to be!
Dec 08 20:13:24 <JordiGH>	kensanata: tell me more.
Dec 08 20:13:28 <JordiGH>	sql-mode is so... dumb.
Dec 08 20:13:37 <kensanata>	JordiGH: As far as I remember, they were tied to certain vendor, though. SQL*Plus by Oracle, for example.
Dec 08 20:14:06 <JordiGH>	I just want better indentation and syntax highlighting.
Dec 08 20:14:49 <kensanata>	JordiGH: Hm. I thought highlighting was pretty good. What are you missing?
Dec 08 20:15:07 <kensanata>	JordiGH: One easy thing to miss is that you need to switch away from ANSI highlighting if you want fancier stuff?
Dec 08 20:15:16 <JordiGH>	It's really dumb about highlighting stuff in the wrong context.
Dec 08 20:15:21 <kensanata>	Ah.
Dec 08 20:15:28 <JordiGH>	For example, if I have a SQL column named value, it highlights it.
Dec 08 20:15:36 <JordiGH>	Even if I write "value" it also highlights it.
Dec 08 20:15:51 <kensanata>	Yeah... That's simple fontlocking...
Dec 08 20:16:14 <JordiGH>	It also seems to be as dumb as fundamental-mode for indentation.
Dec 08 20:16:18 <kensanata>	All I can say is that at the office I switched from SQL mode to DBeaver...
Dec 08 20:16:22 <wasamasa>	let's switch to yi and write parsers for every major mode
Dec 08 20:16:28 <kensanata>	Yeah, there's no indentation standard.
Dec 08 20:16:45 <wasamasa>	there's a package for indentation
Dec 08 20:16:47 <kensanata>	JordiGH: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SqlIndent
Dec 08 20:16:51 <JordiGH>	There's no indentation standard for C either but we try.
Dec 08 20:16:56 <wasamasa>	it's available in GNU ELPA
Dec 08 20:17:13 <kensanata>	JordiGH: https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-sql-postgres
Dec 08 20:17:53 <JordiGH>	Ooh, nicferrier.
Dec 08 20:17:56 <JordiGH>	,libation
Dec 08 20:17:57 *	fsbot pours one out for those we have lost.
Dec 08 20:18:14 <oni-on-ion>	ty
Dec 08 20:18:27 <JordiGH>	What does "pro" mean on his github profile?
Dec 08 20:18:45 <wasamasa>	paid
Dec 08 20:19:13 <JordiGH>	He paid for github??
Dec 08 20:19:13 <fsbot>	It is certain!
Dec 08 20:19:19 <technomancy>	lol
Dec 08 20:19:21 <JordiGH>	lol
Dec 08 20:19:58 <bremner>	rudybot: pro-stitute has a stigma, so let's replace it with sex-worker, or sex for short.
Dec 08 20:20:19 <rudybot>	bremner: not to mention the social stigma
Dec 08 20:20:29 <bremner>	uh. right.
Dec 08 20:22:45 <bbuccianti>	hey he can be using github for students
Dec 08 20:22:51 <bbuccianti>	that makes you a pro user of github
Dec 08 20:24:24 <dd7>	Are there any standard/good patterns for temporarily disabling `cursor-sensor-mode`? I believe that the control variable `cursor-sensor-inhibit` cannot be `let`-bound, because the redisplay hook runs in a different thread.
Dec 08 20:25:01 <wasamasa>	JordiGH: https://github.com/pricing
Dec 08 20:26:34 <JordiGH>	wasamasa: Not clicking on that, you little shill, you.
Dec 08 20:26:52 <wasamasa>	it explains what exactly the "pro" part means
Dec 08 20:27:01 <wasamasa>	including the situation where you can get it for free as a student
Dec 08 20:28:40 <JordiGH>	Look man, I'm busy polishing my dotemacs here.
Dec 08 20:30:15 <bbuccianti>	dotemacs pro
Dec 08 20:32:56 <dd7>	I have something working like `(setq cursor-sensor-inhibit '(my-reason)) ... (do-my-thing) ... (run-with-idle-timer 0 nil (lambda () (setq cursor-sensor-inhibit nil)))`, which appears to work. Does anyone see a better way?
Dec 08 20:33:35 <dd7>	(I haven't tested the 0 delay thoroughly but it appeared to work on first few tries)
Dec 08 20:33:42 <bbuccianti>	I realized that when i'm looking for something with isearch and my cursor is on the other end I can press the complement. If searching forward and I'm in the right word, I can press C-r and it moves cursor to the beginning
Dec 08 20:33:49 <bbuccianti>	emacs rocks!
Dec 08 21:09:54 <JordiGH>	And thus the dotemacs grows yet again: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/shortlog/@
Dec 08 21:15:01 <caoliver>	How do people manage to wind up with so much crud in emacs?
Dec 08 21:15:28 *	caoliver has this is /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp: http://ix.io/23Uy
Dec 08 21:19:56 <johnjay>	caoliver: as soon as my init.el got over a few screenfuls of text i organized it slightly with headers in comments
Dec 08 21:20:27 <johnjay>	e.g. ;;*Lisp, ;;**Lisp Debugging, ;;***Specialized Lisp Debugging, ;;****Something
Dec 08 21:20:33 <caoliver>	Mine is about 270 lines.
Dec 08 21:21:19 <caoliver>	Keys bind file is 113.
Dec 08 21:21:53 <caoliver>	Small lisp utils 70lines.
Dec 08 21:22:09 <caoliver>	I guess I'm just not one of the cool kids.
Dec 08 21:22:53 <wasamasa>	I have a tiny emacs config for work
Dec 08 21:22:54 <JordiGH>	527 lines: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/file/@/dotemacs.el
Dec 08 21:24:18 <caoliver>	I think I have of the not-always-needed set as autoloads.
Dec 08 21:24:50 <caoliver>	There are a handful of things that really need to be required.  (I think auctex is one of those)
Dec 08 21:25:17 <caoliver>	bookmark+ and annot seem to need to really be loaded.
Dec 08 21:25:57 <caoliver>	as do key-chord and key-seq.
Dec 08 21:26:34 <johnjay>	mine has 246 lines. also apparently call-process doesn't do any shell interpretation. crap
Dec 08 21:27:58 <johnjay>	wasamasa: i was thinking about how racket is still clearly educational project
Dec 08 21:28:08 <johnjay>	does that mean scheme in general is more useful for learning things than for "doing work"?
Dec 08 21:28:48 <wasamasa>	dunno
Dec 08 21:28:53 *	caoliver would look at Chez for serious stuff.
Dec 08 21:28:56 <wasamasa>	I happen to have used it for work
Dec 08 21:28:58 <caoliver>	But I'm weird.
Dec 08 21:29:09 <wasamasa>	there are a bunch of other people who did the same
Dec 08 21:29:19 <wasamasa>	personally I'm happier to use it for hobbyist projects
Dec 08 21:29:28 <johnjay>	well like if you wanted to mess with sql. or networking, or specialized math stuff or xml
Dec 08 21:29:33 <wasamasa>	I've currently dedusted one of those and am going through a test suite
Dec 08 21:30:17 *	caoliver is more likely to be fully demented and play with SBCL for that sort of leaning.
Dec 08 21:30:51 <caoliver>	Don't get me wrong.  There are differences between CL and Scheme that I find annoying.
Dec 08 21:31:45 *	caoliver tends to beat on LuaJIT these days though.  Annoying syntax.  Occasionally annoying semantics.  But damn it's both small and fast.
Dec 08 21:32:16 <wasamasa>	did you try fennel?
Dec 08 21:33:19 <technomancy>	caoliver: if you're a lisper who's done a lot with luajit have you taken a look at Fennel?
Dec 08 21:33:21 <caoliver>	I gave it a look, but I found some annoyances.  I had hoped for a Lisp REPL like feel, but it felt weird and alien.
Dec 08 21:33:32 <technomancy>	jinx
Dec 08 21:33:50 <technomancy>	hm; because of not having cons cells, or something else?
Dec 08 21:33:59 <caoliver>	Like all the fun backquote stuff didn't seem to work.
Dec 08 21:34:15 <technomancy>	oh, how long ago did you look at it?
Dec 08 21:34:20 <technomancy>	backquote was added less than a year ago
Dec 08 21:34:40 <caoliver>	OK.  Probably after my glancing.
Dec 08 21:34:52 <technomancy>	just curious
Dec 08 21:37:01 <technomancy>	I found it to be very useful without backtick, but I can see how it might be disorienting
Dec 08 21:37:29 <johnjay>	JordiGH: rainbow-mode ftw
Dec 08 21:48:23 <johnjay>	hrm. is there any benefit to having custom-set variables be at the end of the .emacs file?
Dec 08 21:52:56 <offby1>	as opposed to earlier?
Dec 08 21:57:31 <johnjay>	i guess.
Dec 08 21:57:43 <johnjay>	it's not really customary to just edit it directly is it?
Dec 08 21:57:53 <johnjay>	that's the only thing i can think of
Dec 08 21:59:24 <enyo-eris>	test
Dec 08 21:59:48 <enyo-eris>	Is anyone here? I'm testing my ERC configuration.
Dec 08 22:00:57 <notzmv>	hi enyo-eris 
Dec 08 22:00:58 <bbuccianti>	,ping
Dec 08 22:00:58 <fsbot>	␕
Dec 08 22:02:54 <enyo-eris>	Cool. So it works. Now to configure it more. Thanks.
Dec 08 22:04:58 <notzmv>	yw comrade
Dec 08 22:07:00 <johnjay>	in server.el is the reason you run (server-start) so that you can remotely login to emacs?
Dec 08 22:07:17 <johnjay>	otherwise i don't see why you use it
Dec 08 22:17:49 <offby1>	it's so you can connect to emacs with emacsclient
Dec 08 22:17:56 <offby1>	now, why would you want to do that?  I dunno
Dec 08 22:18:20 <offby1>	"remotely login to emacs" doesn't really mean anything
Dec 08 22:20:00 <offby1>	oh wait -- it's so that when you're using an interactive shell in emacs -- like M-x shell-mode RET -- you can set the EDITOR environment variable to "emacsclient", and then if you run a program, in that shell, that tries to edit something (like the thing-that-I-never-use that edits /etc/passwd) it'll just open a new emacs buffer, instead of trying to e.g. launch vim in the *shell* buffer, which would be a mess
Dec 08 22:35:00 <johnjay>	i... see
Dec 08 22:35:17 <johnjay>	"remotely login" meaning, if host A has emacs on it and i want to connect to it from host B
Dec 08 22:35:23 <johnjay>	as in like when i start a tmux up or something
Dec 08 22:35:31 <johnjay>	but i guess yeah you can just use tmux for that
Dec 08 22:36:15 <johnjay>	JordiGH: is there going to be a line in this dotemacs that defines a command highlight-current-line and binds it to double-clicking mouse-1?
Dec 08 22:36:23 <johnjay>	because i just realized i need this
Dec 08 22:36:42 <johnjay>	hrm, emacs already does it if i triple-click. odd
Dec 08 22:41:38 <JordiGH>	johnjay: do not wnat
Dec 08 22:42:43 <johnjay>	i just figured out how apply-ansi-color-on-region works
Dec 08 22:42:45 <johnjay>	mind = blown
Dec 08 22:43:03 <johnjay>	er ansi-color-apply
Dec 08 22:47:09 <JordiGH>	From my dotemacs?
Dec 08 22:48:50 <johnjay>	yes i'm trying to scavenge anything I can. 
Dec 08 22:48:56 <johnjay>	like Rey on Jaaku
Dec 08 22:50:21 <JordiGH>	Well, that's what it's for.
Dec 08 22:51:14 <johnjay>	i should probably share my init.el now that i figured out that cool paren matching feature
Dec 08 22:51:40 <johnjay>	it's like show-paren-mode but it highlights ( vertically
Dec 08 22:52:28 <johnjay>	but yeah i wanted to ask you specifically. do you ever edit custom-set-variables?
Dec 08 22:52:43 <johnjay>	i was wondering if i should move mine to the end of the file for that purpose
Dec 08 22:54:05 <JordiGH>	Y'know what, let's make it official: http://inversethought.com/hg/dotemacs/rev/ceff26bc036e
Dec 08 22:54:36 <JordiGH>	johnjay: I happily use M-x customize and let it do whatever it wants at the bottom of my file.
Dec 08 22:55:24 <johnjay>	ok
Dec 08 22:57:00 <johnjay>	you used legalese to add a copyright notice?
Dec 08 22:57:19 <JordiGH>	Yep.
Dec 08 22:57:23 <JordiGH>	M-x legalese
Dec 08 22:58:00 <johnjay>	ah you have to do M-< first or it inserts at point
Dec 08 22:59:41 <johnjay>	also random question i wondered before
Dec 08 22:59:48 <johnjay>	can you insert evalled expressions into a minibuffer?
Dec 08 22:59:52 <johnjay>	like with a recursive edit or something?
Dec 08 23:00:16 <johnjay>	i wanted to do something like (setq init "/home/johnjay/.emacs.d/init.el")
Dec 08 23:00:23 <johnjay>	then C-x C-f init
Dec 08 23:49:18 <q[corwin]>	JordiGH: I'm doing same as johnjay. tyvm
Dec 08 23:49:44 <JordiGH>	Yeah, sure.
Dec 08 23:50:03 <JordiGH>	Curious to know what you might find useful.
Dec 08 23:50:36 <q[corwin]>	well, that's the great part about adding the BS at the top- even if I can't find you on IRC I can let you knwo :)
Dec 08 23:50:44 <q[corwin]>	s/knwo/know
Dec 08 23:53:35 <JordiGH>	Oh, 'cause my email is ther.e
Dec 08 23:53:56 <q[corwin]>	yea\
Dec 08 23:54:22 <johnjay>	q[corwin]: i updated the paren-highlighting code so now it only comes on when show-parens is activated, not all the time
Dec 08 23:54:39 <johnjay>	plus idk why i made which-function-mode activate for just elisp. the file says it works for c, perl, and a bunch of things
Dec 08 23:55:04 <johnjay>	JordiGH: i'm adding everything but the requires and things i don't usually use like matlab
Dec 08 23:55:30 <johnjay>	also stripes doesn't exist in melpa so idk what it is
Dec 08 23:55:32 <JordiGH>	I probably have some cruft here, but he, cba to clean up.
Dec 08 23:55:52 <johnjay>	gotcha
Dec 08 23:58:44 <johnjay>	this tabbar thing is confusing. it automatically creates groups for you
Dec 08 23:58:51 <johnjay>	at least it lets you close them

Dec 17 08:27:38 <twb>	Doe USA still have a "flag day" ?
Dec 17 08:27:54 <twb>	I don't mean a day to make a brute-force transition to a New World Order
Dec 17 08:28:05 <twb>	I mean like going "hooray, we have a flag" and drinking beer or whatever
Dec 17 08:29:30 <twb>	Yeah looks like they still have that.  Weirdly, they celebrate adopting a flag that they stopped using ages ago
Dec 17 08:31:03 <Sketch>	july 4th?
Dec 17 08:31:03 <twb>	Yeah their flag day celebrates a flag that was *neither* the first US federal flag *nor* the current one.
Dec 17 08:31:21 <twb>	Sketch: no it's June 14
Dec 17 08:32:39 <twb>	The reason I know about it at all is because in sysadmin circles it's the name for a day where you fuck up all the users at once - and it's so called because in USA, they do that on "flag day" because the users are at home drunk and unable to stop you
Dec 17 08:34:52 <Sketch>	i've never heard of this in sysadmin circles (particularly american ones)
Dec 17 08:35:05 <twb>	Sketch: blame esr
Dec 17 08:36:27 <twb>	Someone should convince Trump to switch back from flags to standards.
Dec 17 08:36:35 <twb>	that would offer any number of hilarious puns
Dec 17 08:44:00 <twb>	Huh so USA ordered some guy called "Matt Perry" to stop people shipping slaves to itself.  It took him nearly six months to stop each ship.
Dec 17 08:44:08 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Slave_Trade_Patrol
Dec 17 08:45:22 <twb>	It sounds like it wasn't his fault, though, the US government made sure he couldn't do anything
Dec 17 08:47:01 <twb>	Ah, Perry is the guy who sailed up to Japan and said "buy our consumer goods our we'll fuck up your country"

Jan 02 17:13:20 <str1ngs>	see with ':test as well
Jan 02 17:13:38 <str1ngs>	in this case :test is a symbol
Jan 02 17:13:47 <thblt>	a keyword is like a symbol, excepts it evaluates to itself, so it's easier to use as, err, a keyword. (let ((whatever "something")) (list (eval 'whatever) (eval ':whatever)))
Jan 02 17:14:00 <dale>	str1ngs: And no, the keyword symbol :test is not the same as the symbol test.
Jan 02 17:14:06 <dale>	,(eq 'test :test)
Jan 02 17:14:06 <fsbot>	D'oh!  Symbol’s value as variable is void: fs-:test
Jan 02 17:14:21 <dale>	Well, that evaluates to nil, trust me.
Jan 02 17:14:41 <str1ngs>	if it's "quoted" 
Jan 02 17:14:55 <str1ngs>	,(eq 'test ':test)
Jan 02 17:14:55 <fsbot>	nil  ..(symbol)
Jan 02 17:14:55 <Greth>	str1ngs: ah thank you, so this would be the right track for documentation? https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Common-Keywords.html is it specific to emacs customization tools?
Jan 02 17:15:00 <dale>	str1ngs: Er, sorry, I meant to direct my comment to Greth, not you.
Jan 02 17:15:11 <str1ngs>	dale: no worries
Jan 02 17:15:13 <mphojele>	Greth: Think of :word as in when a function takes a lots of arguments and giving it positional arguments would be to much work, so you take a shortcut. I think in C-like languages it looks like this: console.log(message="Hello World") 
Jan 02 17:15:27 <dale>	str1ngs: That is an interesting quirk of fsbot that I look forward to forgetting many more times in the future, thank you.
Jan 02 17:16:04 <str1ngs>	dale: I mostly use scheme is if I'm wrong about a nuance and need correct that's okay :)
Jan 02 17:16:10 <str1ngs>	so if*
Jan 02 17:17:08 <thblt>	A keyword is a different type of atom than a symbol, although the internal representation is usally very close or the very same, except for the type tag of course.
Jan 02 17:17:44 <thblt>	(Usually, some sort of integer)
Jan 02 17:17:50 <str1ngs>	that's good to know. 
Jan 02 17:18:42 <str1ngs>	does elisp have a class-of function like guile?
Jan 02 17:19:09 <str1ngs>	class-of returns the type of a binding
Jan 02 17:19:16 <thblt>	,,df class-of
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	class-of is an alias for ‘eieio-object-class’ in ‘eieio.el’.
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	(class-of OBJ)
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	This function is obsolete since 24.4;
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	use ‘eieio-object-class’ instead.
Jan 02 17:19:16 <fsbot>	Return the class struct defining OBJ.
Jan 02 17:19:38 <dale>	thblt: Hm, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Symbol-Components.html reads to me that a keyword is a type of symbol.
Jan 02 17:19:50 <str1ngs>	thblt: thank you
Jan 02 17:20:06 <dale>	,(type-of :foo)
Jan 02 17:20:06 <fsbot>	Oh sh**!  Symbol’s value as variable is void: fs-:foo
Jan 02 17:20:10 <dale>	,(type-of ':foo)
Jan 02 17:20:10 <fsbot>	symbol  ..(symbol)
Jan 02 17:20:23 <thblt>	dale: yes, the difference is in semantics, not internal representation.
Jan 02 17:20:24 <dale>	str1ngs: See?  Already forgetting!
Jan 02 17:20:57 <thblt>	funny, type-of identifies them as symbol too. Weirds. 
Jan 02 17:21:23 <thblt>	Well, I have no issue with calling them symbols, but then we need a distinct name for “proper” symbols.
Jan 02 17:22:19 <str1ngs>	,(type-of (current-buffer))
Jan 02 17:22:19 <fsbot>	whoops,  Symbol’s function definition is void: fs-current-buffer
Jan 02 17:22:38 <str1ngs>	lol why cant we write to fsbot's buffers?
Jan 02 17:22:46 <thblt>	Apparently in Emacs a symbol is "a symbol whose name starts with ‘:’". So it's really absolutely the same. Fun.
Jan 02 17:22:50 <thblt>	(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Constant-Variables.html#Constant-Variables)
Jan 02 17:23:18 <cvandusen>	a bot's buffers are sacrosanct
Jan 02 17:23:59 <dale>	thblt: I thought this was also the case in Common Lisp, but perhaps I was misled.
Jan 02 17:24:17 <thblt>	And because Elisp is fun, you can even setq a keyword, but… only to itself: (setq :keyword :keyword), but not (setq :keyword :nothing)
Jan 02 17:25:57 <dale>	thblt: Huh!
Jan 02 17:26:16 <dale>	thblt: Recently bpalmer and I were noticing that, in recent Emacs, you can let bind keywords, which is probably a bug.
Jan 02 17:26:29 <dale>	Ex. (let ((:foo 42)) :foo) → 42

Jan 02 17:34:39 <parsnip>	do you agree pandoc conversion of docx tables to org should not add two spaces like |_blah___|
Jan 02 17:34:42 <dale>	Hi parsnip.
Jan 02 17:35:38 <dale>	parsnip: Why would it be necessary or even useful to add those spaces?  I don't immediately see any good reason, though I'm not super-familiar with org-mode markup.  Unless that question has a good answer, I think "yes, I agree".
Jan 02 17:35:57 <thblt>	parsnip: FWIW, pandoc conversion goes through an abstract intermediate representation, so your issue is either with the docx reader or the org writer. 
Jan 02 17:36:22 <parsnip>	oh right, so i should test with an html -> org conversion maybe
Jan 02 17:36:47 <Greth>	Thank you guys for the help :) appreciated the descussion afterwords as well.
Jan 02 17:36:55 <thblt>	Isn't it just to keep the | aligned on all rows?
Jan 02 17:37:43 <thblt>	Or does it add extra spaces beyond what's needed?
Jan 02 17:37:49 <parsnip>	yes, the latter
Jan 02 17:38:04 <parsnip>	there should be one space beyond max width
Jan 02 17:38:10 <parsnip>	but instead there are three
Jan 02 17:38:35 <parsnip>	it looks like it's same for my round trip script through html

Jan 02 17:49:25 <npostavs>	thblt, dale: it works in lexical-binding mode, but not in dynamic binding mode for me (emacs 26)
Jan 02 17:49:45 <dale>	Oh, in IELM lexical-binding → t.
Jan 02 17:50:08 <dale>	And in *scratch*.
Jan 02 17:50:18 <dale>	npostavs: Is this expected behavior?
Jan 02 17:50:20 <thblt>	Ignore me you were right, I can reproduce.
Jan 02 17:50:38 <thblt>	HEAD now declares itself to be 28.50, 27 is coming.
Jan 02 17:51:38 <thblt>	(I guess I could have learned this by following emacs-devel too)
Jan 02 17:54:11 <npostavs>	dale: maybe?  It kind of makes sense, because lexically binding a symbol doesn't actually modify the symbol-value slot.
Jan 02 17:56:19 <bandali>	npostavs, hey, do you use erc by any chance? i was wondering if you could review yet another patch of mine
Jan 02 17:56:40 <npostavs>	bandali: no, rcirc actually
Jan 02 17:57:01 <bandali>	ah..
Jan 02 17:57:08 <thblt>	But keywords arent't supposed to evaluate to anything except themselves
Jan 02 17:57:23 *	thblt tries with 25
Jan 02 17:58:08 <bandali>	in any case, i’d appreciate more eyes on this: https://bugs.gnu.org/38257
Jan 02 17:58:13 <thblt>	Error. So there's a bug somewhere between 26 and HEAD. Reporting it.
Jan 02 17:58:18 <bandali>	(for anyone else who uses ERC)
Jan 02 17:58:26 <bandali>	would be nice if it could make it for 27
Jan 02 18:06:52 <neuro_sys>	Is it possible to make Flycheck ignore a missing config file? Or is it Checker specific, in this case javascript-eslint.
Jan 02 18:06:57 <dale>	thblt: Thanks, I never got around to it.
Jan 02 18:07:17 <thblt>	No, the bug, if it's a bug, is also in 25
Jan 02 18:07:44 <thblt>	But in all versions it requires `lexical-binding` to be t, which I guess is the default in 28
Jan 02 18:10:03 <dale>	I feel like it's probably bad that keywords can ever not evaluate to themselves.
Jan 02 18:10:51 <thblt>	Isn't that the whole point of keywords?
Jan 02 18:12:00 <thblt>	(honest question! I may be missing something)
Jan 02 18:13:24 <wasamasa>	why would let-binding a keyword even work, wtf
Jan 02 18:13:36 <dale>	I'm imagining code like (defun write-file (path &optional overwrite) "... If OVERWRITE is :prompt then the user will be prompted." ...) but someone does (let ((:prompt t)) (function-that-calls-write-file)).
Jan 02 18:14:07 <wasamasa>	and why would lexical-binding ever be the default
Jan 02 18:14:07 <grym>	if i have launched emacs, is there a way to convert that pid into an emacsclient instead? (does that question even parse?) 
Jan 02 18:14:20 <jeremy_c>	Is there a way for melpa to read my README.org instead of my elisp comments when it creates the -readme.txt file?
Jan 02 18:14:48 <wasamasa>	melpa reuses standard emacs functionality for that, so sure, change what emacs does and wait a few years
Jan 02 18:15:06 <jeremy_c>	wasamasa: OK, so no ;-)

Jan 02 18:15:30 <wasamasa>	alternatively, convince them of that being a good idea

Jan 02 18:20:18 <thblt>	(I don't know why I leave all the noise M-x report-emacs-bug creates for this kind of issue.)
Jan 02 18:20:25 <wasamasa>	well, it's likelier to happen, an .org file isn't part of the package, so there's less incentive for emacs to support that
Jan 02 18:20:34 <wasamasa>	I could see melpa looking at the repository for a readme file
Jan 02 18:21:05 <thblt>	They may accept a patch adding a :readme option to the recipe.
Jan 02 18:29:13 <spudpnds>	grym: like you want to take an existing emacs process and convert it into a client.
Jan 02 18:30:00 <thblt>	You may start the server with M-x server-start, but it won't be exactly the same as emacs --daemon
Jan 02 18:30:16 <grym>	spudpnds: yes
Jan 02 18:30:25 <bpalmer>	what does that mean, to turn it into a client?
Jan 02 18:30:40 <bpalmer>	you opened up  an emacs and wish you were inside another emacs process?
Jan 02 18:30:51 <spudpnds>	I think it means connecting it to a server.
Jan 02 18:31:01 <grym>	^ that
Jan 02 18:31:05 <spudpnds>	I'm pretty sure there is not M-x client-start ;)
Jan 02 18:31:17 <bpalmer>	M-: (shell-command "emacsclient &") RET
Jan 02 18:31:26 <bpalmer>	unless you really care about process identity
Jan 02 18:31:46 <grym>	bpalmer: i don't, particularly.   thanks! 
Jan 02 18:32:24 <grym>	 ooo it's C-x # now not C-x 5 0 ... ? 
Jan 02 18:32:25 <bpalmer>	which isn't that different from just closing emacs and then typing emacsclient instead. 
Jan 02 18:32:44 <grym>	(just bumped to 26.3)
Jan 02 18:32:46 <bpalmer>	(It 'looks' like you're opening a new frame as the client, but it's a lie)
Jan 02 18:33:07 <grym>	bpalmer: as long as i can open new GUI windows snappily, we good 
Jan 02 18:33:39 <bpalmer>	some people just alias emacs to be emacsclient -a "" 
Jan 02 18:33:54 <spudpnds>	Yup, I do that.
Jan 02 18:34:04 <grym>	bpalmer: i've more or less done that, but today's been a little wonky on the configuration hacking side 
Jan 02 18:42:53 <grym>	has emacsclient changed recently? `emacsclient -a ""` gives me `emacsclient: file name or argument required` and nothing else 
Jan 02 18:43:10 <grym>	but emacsclient --help still says that the emptystring will do what it used to 
Jan 02 18:43:36 <grym>	i'm using kelleyk emacs 26.3
Jan 02 18:44:00 <thblt>	You need to give it a filename or -c
Jan 02 18:46:48 <grym>	hmm.  ok, that gives connection refused and then the standard spiel about some GTK bug
Jan 02 18:47:00 <grym>	what's the emacsclient version of -q 
Jan 02 18:47:51 <grym>	i'm getting my normal "yasnippets loaded" message and then ... crickets 
Jan 02 18:48:02 <grym>	so i'm wondering what in my config might be being stupjid 
Jan 02 18:48:44 <thblt>	strictly speaking, there's none. emacsclient calls into a running instance.
Jan 02 18:54:35 <MoziM>	grym: you can launch emacs with a unique title like "EMACS-MAIN-FRAME", then search all processes for that unique title and grab the pid from it
Jan 02 18:55:25 <MoziM>	grym: after launching emacs and the emacsclient isn't already running, you can simply run (server-start)
Jan 02 19:19:43 <thblt>	I'm tempted to try reverting to package.el for most of my Emacs config, instead of Borg.
Jan 02 19:21:29 <thblt>	Straight looks uselessly complicated (for me)
Jan 02 19:22:52 <bandali>	in my experience, straight.el works pretty great if you invest some time and reads it (very long) readme
Jan 02 19:23:09 <bandali>	but i myself am switching over to letting guix manage my emacs packages
Jan 02 19:24:19 <thblt>	How does guix/nix manage package udpates, compared to eg Melpa? Does a human need to modify the derivation (or whatever it's called on Guix) for every git push?
Jan 02 19:24:56 <thblt>	Using Nix for the bulk of my packages and Borg for things I contribute to seems a good idea.
Jan 02 19:25:28 *	technomancy just uses (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/whatever") for packages he contributes to
Jan 02 19:27:29 <thblt>	Yeah, actually… :)
Jan 02 19:27:45 <bandali>	thblt, yeah; see https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/log/gnu/packages/emacs-xyz.scm to get a feel
Jan 02 19:28:09 <bandali>	tho i think guix does have some mechanism for automatically fetching updates and bumping versions for a package
Jan 02 19:28:14 <bandali>	but i don’t remember what it’s called
Jan 02 19:31:46 <thblt>	Nix seems to somehow directly convert Melpa to Nix. 
Jan 02 19:32:20 <thblt>	But I don't understand how
Jan 02 19:33:05 <bandali>	ha
Jan 02 19:35:15 <thblt>	It creates a derivation from melpa/package-build, but not from melpa/melpa itself
Jan 02 19:39:59 <thblt>	I got it.  It's roughly the same as the Guix process, there's a script that generates nix derivations from Melpa recipes.
Jan 02 19:43:34 <thblt>	And it seems to be updated whenever someone decides to update it :)
Jan 02 19:56:24 <boeg>	Anyone have an idea as to why if I launch emacs in gnome (wayland) it sharp and pretty, but if I launch it in sway (wayland) it's blurry as if in sway, it's launched without wayland support or something?
Jan 02 19:56:56 <thblt>	boeg: on a laptop with a hidpi display?
Jan 02 19:57:06 <boeg>	thblt: yes
Jan 02 19:57:17 <technomancy>	boeg: sometimes that's due to missing font config; like in X if you run an .xsession that doesn't honor .Xdefaults
Jan 02 19:57:19 <boeg>	on the same machine
Jan 02 19:57:29 <technomancy>	I don't know what the wayland equivalent to .Xdefaults is tho
Jan 02 19:57:34 <boeg>	hmm okay
Jan 02 19:57:56 <thblt>	boeg: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/2966
Jan 02 19:59:13 <boeg>	thblt: ah interesting
Jan 02 20:01:35 <boeg>	so gnome is doing something to get emacs to work properly i guess
Jan 02 20:07:47 <aidalgol>	AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jan 02 20:08:03 <bremner>	tell us what you really think
Jan 02 20:08:06 <aidalgol>	Today is a day that makes me hate technology.
Jan 02 20:08:21 <aidalgol>	I woke up to my router having shat itself.
Jan 02 20:08:30 <aidalgol>	In software, not hardware, thankfully
Jan 02 20:08:48 <aidalgol>	But there was no reason for it, and I had to factory reset the damn thing.

Jan 02 20:09:16 <bandali>	lol
Jan 02 20:09:23 <bpalmer>	rudybot: nature, uh, finds a way.
Jan 02 20:09:24 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I am afraid that scientists do not exist in a vacuum, and science fields and faculties can exhibit a pretty strong gender bias (good intro http://blog.ted.com/2013/03/29/op-ed-the-still-tolerated-gender-bias-in-science/ and http://blogs.nature.com/news/2014/04/discrimination-starts-even-before-grad-school-study-finds.html).
Jan 02 20:09:37 <bpalmer>	wow, astronaut slam out of nowhere.
Jan 02 20:09:46 <aidalgol>	I have no idea what happened, so I am going with cosmic rays and getting on with my life.
Jan 02 20:09:54 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some of them are pretty good scientists, you know. 
Jan 02 20:10:02 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Them scientists are pretty mean anyhow. Always with this predicting and stuff.
Jan 02 20:10:15 <bandali>	shitty buggy software is probably what happened
Jan 02 20:10:44 <parsnip>	astronaut slam sounds very painful
Jan 02 20:10:59 <parsnip>	that would really knock the air out of you
Jan 02 20:11:22 <aidalgol>	bandali: It's running OpenWRT, and hasn't failed me for years.
Jan 02 20:15:17 <bandali>	aidalgol, ah! i (somewhat) take that back then :p
Jan 02 20:15:30 <bandali>	i assumed it were running some shitty proprietary stack
Jan 02 20:15:39 <bandali>	(like my parents’ router -_-)

Jan 02 20:30:14 <bpalmer>	Let's put a man in the moon.
Jan 02 20:32:28 <thblt>	Which one?
Jan 02 20:32:41 <johnjay>	super man
Jan 02 20:33:02 <johnjay>	not the one who was born in the soviet union. the american one
Jan 02 20:33:12 <spudpnds>	The Orange one who won't be named?
Jan 02 20:34:20 <parsnip>	Andrew Man
Jan 02 20:34:37 <parsnip>	german superman?
Jan 02 20:34:50 <parsnip>	rudybot: where is twb when you need him?
Jan 02 20:34:52 <rudybot>	parsnip: where is twb when we need him?
Jan 02 20:35:15 <parsnip>	rudybot: donut correct me
Jan 02 20:35:17 <rudybot>	parsnip: I've hard tales of starting Emacs and going and having a cup of coffee and a donut
Jan 02 20:35:33 <parsnip>	rudybot: probably an aeropress
Jan 02 20:35:33 <rudybot>	parsnip: hm, probably i've picked a wrong word. what's that aeropress thing?
Jan 02 20:38:03 <hodapp>	rudybot: your competition, that's what.
Jan 02 20:38:08 <rudybot>	hodapp: does anyone understand what kind of tests the editors were put through in this competition ? http://www.rackspace.com/blog/text-editor-madness-bracket-vote-for-your-favorite/
Jan 02 20:41:34 <boeg>	Anyone know how to get leading stars to be hidden when using org-bullets with org-mode in terminal emacs? Works in GUI but in terminal they have a light grey background
Jan 02 20:45:45 <grym>	no no, which moon 
Jan 02 20:52:07 <bpalmer>	one that's not a space station
Jan 02 20:55:20 <grym>	phobos it is, but don't bring the rock; he'll try to gakk all your scientists
Jan 02 20:55:34 <grym>	doom was such a good good/bad movie 
Jan 02 20:57:32 <bpalmer>	apparently there's a Doom: Annihilation movie now
Jan 02 20:58:00 <spudpnds>	boeg: Let me know if you find out, I have the same problem.
Jan 02 20:59:16 <spudpnds>	https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/issues/16
Jan 02 21:14:02 <boeg>	spudpnds: yes, doesn't seem to be a fix for it 
Jan 02 21:15:01 <boeg>	spudpnds: other than figuring out how spacemacs does it
Jan 02 21:16:10 <spudpnds>	yeah, frustrating.
Jan 02 21:18:27 <spudpnds>	I think a decent solution would be to turn off org-bullets when you're in a TTY frame, and turn it on for GUI frames.
Jan 02 21:24:30 <spudpnds>	boeg: https://github.com/emacsorphanage/org-bullets
Jan 02 21:25:24 <spudpnds>	Might be worth uninstalling the MELPA org-bullets and manually installing this one, as org-bullets is essentially unmaintained.
Jan 02 21:26:19 <johnjay>	is there an emacs speedbar like mode for navigating in a file?
Jan 02 21:26:28 <johnjay>	the default register keys take a lot of effort to press
Jan 02 21:26:30 <boeg>	but isn't it just the same thing, spudpnds ?
Jan 02 21:26:59 <dale>	johnjay: I think speedbar itself can kind of do it, but I like https://github.com/bmag/imenu-list.
Jan 02 21:28:08 <spudpnds>	boeg: mmm, it seems to have a bunch of commits from tarsius.
Jan 02 21:28:17 <boeg>	spudpnds: ah ok
Jan 02 21:28:48 <boeg>	spudpnds: how do you install it from there? Just download it an load it manually and is there a better way?
Jan 02 21:29:04 <johnjay>	dale: when i click on the file in speedbar it shows some categories i guess it defined?
Jan 02 21:29:12 <johnjay>	i just want to navigate to line XYZ fast with a mouse click
Jan 02 21:29:14 <dale>	johnjay: Could be from imenu?
Jan 02 21:29:57 <johnjay>	sorry what?
Jan 02 21:30:03 <johnjay>	i'm looking at speedbar default
Jan 02 21:30:10 <spudpnds>	boeg: The old fashioned way, copy org-bullets.el somewhere on your load-path. For me I have ~/.emacs.d/lisp in my load path.
Jan 02 21:30:16 <dale>	johnjay: The "categories" could be from imenu.
Jan 02 21:30:25 <dale>	johnjay: I really don't remember, I don't use speedbar.
Jan 02 21:30:36 <boeg>	spudpnds: right, ok
Jan 02 21:30:40 <johnjay>	ah ok. well either way i don't want a list of classes and variables
Jan 02 21:30:46 <johnjay>	just list of file locations to click on
Jan 02 21:30:56 <johnjay>	sort of like boomark list i guess
Jan 02 21:30:59 <johnjay>	but for mouse action
Jan 02 21:31:18 *	johnjay wishes he'd done that minimap for emacs idea
Jan 02 21:31:40 <johnjay>	instead of using M-< with a prefix you just click on a square to scroll to X% through the buffer
Jan 02 21:31:56 <spudpnds>	boeg: argh, it looks like that particular "stars invisible" PR is only available on specific branch?
Jan 02 21:31:58 <dale>	What about... the scroll bars?
Jan 02 21:31:59 <spudpnds>	Trying to figure it out now.
Jan 02 21:32:01 <slondr>	johnjay: You mean like VSCode and IntelliJ have?
Jan 02 21:32:06 <slondr>	Isn't there an emacs plugin for that?
Jan 02 21:32:13 <johnjay>	not sure, haven't used VScode. i'll just use occur mode for now
Jan 02 21:32:25 <boeg>	spudpnds: ah, right
Jan 02 21:32:26 <johnjay>	it's not pretty but lets you mouse click list of things
Jan 02 21:32:40 <johnjay>	you have to use regexp to define it though
Jan 02 21:32:42 <dale>	johnjay: There's also minimap and sublimity.
Jan 02 21:32:53 <dale>	(Neither of which I've ever tried.)
Jan 02 21:33:06 <boeg>	spudpnds: should I just use "load-library"  to load the file? Is that the proper way? 
Jan 02 21:33:30 <johnjay>	dale: the minimap package is so close to being what I'd like
Jan 02 21:33:38 <johnjay>	the problem is the "minimap" scrolls. which kinda defeats the purpose
Jan 02 21:33:47 <spudpnds>	boeg: (require 'org-bullets) 
Jan 02 21:34:06 <johnjay>	it also takes up too much screen space. need a way to display a small window or taskbar at the bottom of emacs imo
Jan 02 21:34:10 <johnjay>	but i'm not sure how to do that
Jan 02 21:34:24 <mphojele>	johnjay: i think you are imagining the swoop package having click-able results.
Jan 02 21:34:25 <johnjay>	probably easier just to have a small window with images in it...?
Jan 02 21:34:30 <boeg>	spudpnds: alright
Jan 02 21:35:35 <zeta_0>	in order to shorten bash's path, in this code i changed all the lowercase w's to uppercase W's, and it seems to be working correctly the only issue is i think the `/` is supposed to be inserted before the directory, how would i fix this? https://hastebin.com/yutefiqada.bash
Jan 02 21:36:05 <zeta_0>	[zeta@nixos:nix-haskell-recipes]$ pwd
Jan 02 21:36:46 <zeta_0>	it works but i think it needs `/` here:
Jan 02 21:36:48 <spudpnds>	beog: Sorry, I led you astray, that patch never made it into the the emacsorphanage version.
Jan 02 21:36:53 <zeta_0>	[zeta@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]$
Jan 02 21:37:52 <zeta_0>	not sure if you guys know bash well or not, but i figured i'd ask this question here
Jan 02 21:38:56 <spudpnds>	beog: I'm going to try to apply this patch https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/pull/21 to the original version and see if I can make it work for me.
Jan 02 21:39:20 <johnjay>	mphojele: ah ok so this swoop thing is like occur i guess?
Jan 02 21:39:46 <boeg>	spudpnds: good luck, think i'm gonna try too
Jan 02 21:40:18 <spudpnds>	boeg: TIL: you can turn a PR into a patch just by adding ".patch" to the end of the URL, i.e: https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets/pull/21.patch
Jan 02 21:40:27 <boeg>	ah cool
Jan 02 21:41:25 <mphojele>	johnjay: and has that little window you asking for; you select and it moves out of your way
Jan 02 21:42:02 <johnjay>	mphojele: little window? you mean the list of search matches itself?
Jan 02 21:44:00 <zeta_0>	lisp is much easier to understand than bash, for me at least
Jan 02 21:44:02 <mphojele>	johnjay: Yes, and it shows up below the buffer you are editing, has commands to scroll and select your line, after you do that, it's gone
Jan 02 21:46:56 <boeg>	spudpnds: seems to work
Jan 02 21:47:20 <mphojele>	zeta_0: try not quoting the dollar sign; it's special in a prompt in that \$ would either result in # for root or $ for any user
Jan 02 21:49:40 <zeta_0>	mphojele: i am not sure what you mean? could you paste what piece of code to change?
Jan 02 21:50:11 <protons_>	does anyone know of a better solution to resizing windows in emacs besides stock
Jan 02 21:50:33 <spudpnds>	boeg: nice!
Jan 02 21:50:35 <boeg>	spudpnds: someone should fork it and apply the match
Jan 02 21:50:44 <boeg>	;)
Jan 02 21:50:52 <boeg>	patch*
Jan 02 21:51:02 <cvandusen>	No, you had it right the first time.
Jan 02 21:51:21 <boeg>	:)
Jan 02 21:52:28 <cvandusen>	rudybot: Def Leppard references are not welcome 
Jan 02 21:52:30 <rudybot>	cvandusen: The drummer from Def Leppard only had one.
Jan 02 21:52:35 <zeta_0>	everything is working great, i just need `/` to be placed before the current working directory like this? [zeta@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]$   [root@nixos:`/`nix-haskell-recipes]#
Jan 02 21:53:20 <mphojele>	zeta_0: Sorry, I just ran straight to your code before understanding your question
Jan 02 21:53:50 <neuro_sys>	General question about hooks. I'd like to disable all themes when ediff-mode is on, and re-enable them when the mode exits. Can anyone help me make this better than this? https://gist.github.com/neuro-sys/c0964bbc6eef32a0116b906cdfd4b708
Jan 02 21:54:11 <zeta_0>	here is the code: https://hastebin.com/yutefiqada.bash
Jan 02 21:54:14 <zeta_0>	mphojele: ^
Jan 02 21:54:52 <dale>	zeta_0: Why do you need a / enclosed backticks in your prompt?
Jan 02 21:56:02 <dale>	neuro_sys: This seems like something likely to break, but one idea is to actually use a buffer-local kill-buffer-hook in your ediff-mode buffers that does something like only turning the themes back on iff the buffer about to be killed is the last ediff-mode buffer.
Jan 02 21:56:35 <zeta_0>	dale: i just want / to be before the current working directory like it was before, after i changed all the lowercase w's to uppercase W's it shortened bash's path like i want but the inserted / went away?
Jan 02 21:56:36 <dale>	neuro_sys: And then ediff-mode-hook needs to not clobber the value of ediff-theme-temporary.  In both of my statements I am thinking about the case that there is >1 simultaneous ediff-mode buffer, which seems highly plausible.
Jan 02 21:57:28 <dale>	zeta_0: So if you're in directory /foo/bar/baz, you want your prompt to read "/baz"?
Jan 02 21:58:02 <neuro_sys>	dale: Thanks, I'll read on buffer-local and kill-buffer-hook.
Jan 02 21:58:04 <zeta_0>	dale: exactly
Jan 02 21:58:53 <dale>	zeta_0: I believe you can just put a literal / before \W.
Jan 02 22:00:13 <zeta_0>	dale: ok, i'll try that out
Jan 02 22:04:26 <zeta_0>	dale: it worked, thanks, it was annoying having a long bash path, so i am glad that i was able to shorten it
Jan 02 22:06:27 <neuro_sys>	dale: Works perfectly now! Could you have a look if any more things to fix? https://gist.github.com/neuro-sys/c0964bbc6eef32a0116b906cdfd4b708
Jan 02 22:12:55 <zeta_0>	dale: it works, the bash's path is shortened, but when i enter a nix-shell it does not inherit the bash settings so the path stays long?
Jan 02 22:13:24 <golluq>	Hi! I wonder if there is a way to start new files with different templates depending on file extention. E.g if I create/open a new file.pl there is already some lines I would like it to have, and other lines for other file endings? Could you point me to right direction for this?
Jan 02 22:14:35 <golluq>	*extension
Jan 02 22:15:20 <parsnip>	google tells me, "auto-insert.el"
Jan 02 22:15:36 <golluq>	Think I found something online regarding template.el, will check it up. seems to be what I look for
Jan 02 22:16:52 <parsnip>	might be based on major-mode, since you usually already have that set up per file extension
Jan 02 22:16:57 <phattycakes>	golluq: yasnippet can do this but auto-insert is super easy to setup and learn.
Jan 02 22:17:37 <golluq>	great, will check those up. I

Jan 02 22:21:38 <parsnip>	JordiGH: done
Jan 02 22:21:45 <JordiGH>	Thanks!
Jan 02 22:22:16 <parsnip>	we should just but contents of ,,spook,, in all subject lines
Jan 02 22:22:16 <fsbot>	ErcSpook: at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErcSpook
Jan 02 22:25:15 <JordiGH>	I think the spook file needs some serious updates.
Jan 02 22:25:30 <JordiGH>	Doesn't it include stuff about the Iran/Contra affair?
Jan 02 22:25:36 <bremner>	Yay, JordiGH is the Gnu new project leader
Jan 02 22:25:42 <bremner>	you heard it here first.
Jan 02 22:25:49 <bremner>	and probably last
Jan 02 22:25:54 <ggoes>	JordiGH: yeah, a lot of stuff like that.
Jan 02 22:26:47 <parsnip>	are data "outlets" /actually/ asymmetrical? can you provide a data plan via these ports?
Jan 02 22:27:15 <Sketch>	bremner: does that mean we have to start calling him jgh?
Jan 02 22:27:22 <parsnip>	i couldn't tell if the word "outlet" was right, since you sometimes upload data. but i guess you don't provide a service plan back up the other way.
Jan 02 22:28:30 <JordiGH>	bremner: Man, that's *two* people that have told me to be head Gnu, haha.
Jan 02 22:30:52 <bremner>	JordiGH: does the other one live with you?
Jan 02 22:31:31 <bremner>	Sketch: or just stick with "jfc"
Jan 02 22:34:56 <JordiGH>	bremner: No, but the other one does hang out in Mastodon too.
Jan 02 22:35:47 <technomancy>	allow me to interject for a moment; what you're referring to as Mastodon is actually one part of a larger social networking system...
Jan 02 22:36:20 <johnjay>	The Federation of Planets?
Jan 02 22:36:21 <Sketch>	,mastodon-bore
Jan 02 22:36:21 <fsbot>	Chess tonight.
Jan 02 22:36:37 <technomancy>	johnjay: close enough
Jan 02 22:37:05 <Sketch>	if only they would unite
Jan 02 22:37:33 <slondr>	When will Mastodon federate with Matrix
Jan 02 22:37:45 <technomancy>	Sketch: CW: spoilers for ENT S04
Jan 02 22:37:48 <slondr>	to create the One True Federation
Jan 02 22:38:12 <technomancy>	slondr: I think that's actually kinda possible?
Jan 02 22:38:19 <technomancy>	thru some weird intermediary
Jan 02 22:38:32 <Sketch>	mastodon-to-irc-to-matrix?
Jan 02 22:38:55 <slondr>	Does Mastodon have an IRC bridge?
Jan 02 22:38:57 <JordiGH>	technomancy: In this case, it really is Mastodon.
Jan 02 22:39:12 <technomancy>	matrix to hubzilla to activitypub or something
Jan 02 22:39:43 <slondr>	I know that GNU Social can't talk to anything in the Fediverse anymore
Jan 02 22:40:00 <technomancy>	slondr: no, it can talk to pleroma still
Jan 02 22:40:03 <Sketch>	there is a bitlbee plugin for mastodon, so you could probably have a bot sit in between the two
Jan 02 22:41:30 <Lordveda>	Does anyone here use anaconda-mode for python dev?
Jan 02 22:41:37 <slondr>	Wait I think there's an XMPP host for Mastodon
Jan 02 22:41:59 <slondr>	XMPP has a Matrix bridge
Jan 02 22:42:15 <hodapp>	fun fact: JordiGH's middle name is actually "GNU"

When I `M-x describe-face` I'm told that it is the `default` face. But that can't be true. Does anyone know what this face is actually called?

Jan 02 22:54:03 <golluq>	bpalmer: thnx
Jan 02 22:54:42 <jaafar>	Instead of a list of potential matches supplied by Google, I get just my exact input string with "Search for 'my pattern here' on Google"
Jan 02 22:55:03 <jaafar>	which kind of obviates the point of using Emacs-based narrowing
Jan 02 22:55:28 <jaafar>	It's plainly not supposed to work that way based on tuhdo's tutorial
Jan 02 22:58:34 <cvandusen>	How have we not shortened "tutorial" to "tuto" by now? 
Jan 02 22:59:08 <JordiGH>	tuts, no?
Jan 02 23:00:03 <cvandusen>	That rhymes with "toots"?
Jan 02 23:01:20 <golluq>	bpalmer: I need to do something like Save for future sessions. How do I do that. I could toggle to "in use" with enter. Emacs say "to install your edits, invoce [state]" 
Jan 02 23:01:39 <golluq>	*invoke
Jan 02 23:02:07 <bpalmer>	hit RET when the point is on "Apply and Save"

Jan 22 10:42:31 <montaropdf>	What could prevent ERC from auto identify my user with NickServ?
Jan 22 10:42:53 <montaropdf>	I hve an entry in .authinfo

Jan 22 10:43:55 <montaropdf>	I have configured ERC according to the doc and https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8ml6na/tip_how_to_make_erc_fun_to_use/
Jan 22 10:44:19 <montaropdf>	So I don't really understand where could be the problem :/
Jan 22 11:07:48 <montaropdf>	My configuration: https://github.com/montaropdf/reve-emacs-config
Jan 22 11:44:34 <blandest`>	montaropdf: (setq erc-nickserv-passwords '((freenode (("montaropdf" . "<password>")))))
Jan 22 11:45:08 <blandest`>	you seem to be lacking this in your config but you have set (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password nil) so you don't get prompted for the password
Jan 22 11:45:36 <blandest`>	you could also try to  (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password t) if you don't want to store your password in your init file :)
Jan 22 11:46:15 <montaropdf>	blandest: shouldn't ERC read the password from the .authinfo file?
Jan 22 11:48:35 <blandest`>	montaropdf: yes, but I am not sure if it also sends that password to NickServ.
Jan 22 11:49:16 <montaropdf>	ok, then I will try with (erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password t)
Jan 22 11:49:26 <montaropdf>	thanks

Jan 22 12:20:03 <wasamasa>	the original one by RMS, one on an emacs-style editor and how they made a semantic major mode for it and one giving a historical overview by the former emacs maintainer
Jan 22 12:20:20 <wasamasa>	there's maybe more by people using org-mode

Jan 22 13:33:36 <ecbrown>	kaiwkx: my erc disconnects frequently, especially if i do an intensive operation in the same emacs session, e.g. threading a large gnus group
Jan 22 13:33:52 <ecbrown>	whether it reconnects is a crapshoot
Jan 22 13:36:12 <kaiwkx>	ecbrown: i guess i missed a lot of fun discussion because of it
Jan 22 13:37:09 <ecbrown>	hah, yeah, it used to bother me so much that i ran it in a different emacs session... but then i realized that i'm probably not missing much :-)
Jan 22 13:39:28 <ecbrown>	probably bigger deal is losing remote REPLs and the like
Jan 22 13:43:58 <kaiwkx>	another annoying thing is, when it reconnecting, it will re-display the irc topics and users
Jan 22 13:47:27 <kaiwkx>	dont know if there is any way to prevent it
Jan 22 13:48:56 <ecbrown>	i'd settle for performance being halved if emacs didn't lock up
Jan 22 13:49:37 <ecbrown>	contemplating a loop construct that is friendly toward multitasking, just so network connections aren't lost
Jan 22 13:58:31 <ecbrown>	oh well, it's everywhere, magit, gnus, operations on large buffers... the only solution that works for me is to run multiple emacs instances and communicate through files 
Jan 22 14:04:49 <kaiwkx>	ecbrown: have to agree...
Jan 22 14:12:45 <kensanata>	ouch
Jan 22 14:13:19 <kensanata>	I wonder whether there is a way to increase the timeout for all your network connections
Jan 22 14:13:35 <ecbrown>	it may be e.g. freenode that is dropping
Jan 22 14:14:42 <ecbrown>	ssh has things like ClientAliveInterval and ServerAliveInterval
Jan 22 14:50:08 <mplsCorwin>	fsbot: later tell kaiwkx that we can ignore messages in ERC with erc-hide-list, e.g (setq erc-hide-list '("JOIN" "MODE" "NICK" "PART" "QUIT" )
Jan 22 14:50:08 <fsbot>	Try: m8b sicp-bait

Jan 22 14:59:47 <fsbot>	<rekor> i've recently started reading SICP. it's been tough, but i've at least seen a lucid flow of the material from section to section, until i reached the Orders of Growth section in chapter 1; it makes absolutely no sense and seems terribly explained to a novice programmer with no programming experience.

Feb 19 12:06:33 <twb>	https://www.gazelle.nl/media//gene-cms/d/e/derailleurversnelling-gazelle-cityzen-c8-hmb---ebike-2.jpg   why do you have an idler sproket on a hub gear
Feb 19 12:12:57 <fledermaus>	dunno, what's an idler thingy?
Feb 19 12:13:29 <twb>	on derailler drivetrains they have an extra sprocket, not connected to anything, on a spring to keep the chain tensioned
Feb 19 12:13:53 <twb>	THis is necessary in derailleur designs because the different driving sprockets are different diameters
Feb 19 12:14:03 <fledermaus>	gotcha.
Feb 19 12:14:17 <twb>	on a hub gear drivetrain, the sprocket is always the same, so you can avoid the idler/tensioner, and also can easily put the entire thing inside a chain case
Feb 19 12:14:37 <twb>	This keeps the chain clean of dirt which is the main thing that fucks up the chain and, in turn, the sprockets
Feb 19 12:14:48 <fledermaus>	hm.
Feb 19 12:15:07 <fledermaus>	is it possible it's a hybrid with a derailleur at the front and hub at the back?
Feb 19 12:15:08 <twb>	also, because the chain doesn't move side-to-side between sprockets, you can use a chain with no sideways bend, i.e. stronger
Feb 19 12:15:46 <twb>	fledermaus: I think most likely they just put it there because it's cheaper than convincing bike shops to stock hub-gear-appropriate chains, and to put chain tugs in
Feb 19 12:16:04 <twb>	And because they don't have a fully enclosed chain case
Feb 19 12:16:25 <twb>	rudybot: t8 en de bicycle chain
Feb 19 12:16:52 <rudybot>	twb: Fahrradkette
Feb 19 12:18:34 <twb>	OK so a repair link is about 2€ and a new chain is about 5€ for a hub chain or 30€ for a racing bike chain
Feb 19 12:19:25 <twb>	Plus like 30€ for labour I guess, for a 15 minute job if you've got the chain-breaking tool and bike stand already

Feb 19 12:32:52 <twb>	I'm pretty sure I'm still running the original chain from 2011
Feb 19 12:33:57 <twb>	yep according to my log it was last serviced in 2016 and that was a "quicklink" for $20 inc. parts and labour
Feb 19 12:34:47 <fledermaus>	https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51499777
Feb 19 12:35:05 <modory>	twb: what 'chain'?
Feb 19 12:35:20 <twb>	modory: on my bicycle
Feb 19 12:35:37 <twb>	so I have a handwritten but not typed up list of the full TCO for this bike
Feb 19 12:39:30 <twb>	A$1900 in 2011-06-02.  Then A$1700 in misc parts and labour, plus another A$600 for a replacement gearbox + wheel rebuild back in 2016.
Feb 19 12:39:55 <twb>	So TCO for it's ~9-year-life so far is about A$4200

Feb 19 12:42:37 <montaropdf>	adgtl: you are welcome
Feb 19 12:42:53 <chrisb>	twb: shimano ultegra?
Feb 19 12:42:53 <twb>	chrisb: are you asking about the fairing?
Feb 19 12:43:12 <twb>	chrisb: no it's a shimano nexus 8 gearest
Feb 19 12:43:52 <twb>	ultegra sounds like a road gearset; this is an omafiet
Feb 19 12:43:56 <chrisb>	twb: the prices seem high, unless the parts are new and "performance"
Feb 19 12:43:59 <montaropdf>	adgtl: BTW, a bit of ad, here is my public Emacs config repo: https://github.com/montaropdf/reve-emacs-config
Feb 19 12:44:10 <montaropdf>	If you see anything useful taketh ;)
Feb 19 12:44:10 <adgtl>	cool
Feb 19 12:44:18 <twb>	chrisb: it's 0 labour from me
Feb 19 12:44:26 <adgtl>	yep.. will take a look and cherry pick things.
Feb 19 12:45:00 <montaropdf>	Hope this will help
Feb 19 12:45:01 <chrisb>	montaropdf: i am always looking to expand my .emacs cargo cult
Feb 19 12:45:01 <twb>	labour is probaly like A$70/hr or something
Feb 19 12:45:46 <montaropdf>	chrisb: ???
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fsbot>	Yes!
Feb 19 12:45:46 <twb>	My previous bike was a Kronan at A$1100 and it only lasted from 2008 to 2011
Feb 19 12:45:46 <chrisb>	,cargo-cult
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fsbot>	Go ahead, blindly copy and paste that code. What could possibly go wrong
Feb 19 12:45:46 <montaropdf>	lol
Feb 19 12:45:46 <fledermaus>	I've got a marin mill valley.
Feb 19 12:45:46 <twb>	THough I don't have records of the kronan's service history
Feb 19 12:45:58 <fledermaus>	Apart from the bottom bracket/crank it came with it's been a great bike.
Feb 19 12:46:51 <twb>	The only real problem I had with the tour populair is its read fender isn't strong enough, and its integrated lighting runs through that fender
Feb 19 12:47:42 <twb>	so when the fender stay breaks it tends to shear to rear dynamo light
Feb 19 12:47:42 <twb>	it's wiring i mean
Feb 19 12:47:43 <twb>	$bike dude fixed that by jerry-rigging stronger stays, sort of like what they do for demo derby cars
Feb 19 12:47:43 <fledermaus>	WIth LED light lifetimes is a dynamo light even worth it these days?
Feb 19 12:49:48 <chrisb>	my .mailcap sets application/pdf; pdftotext %s -; copiousoutput; but eww doesn't render the text, it prints out the pdftotext error message
Feb 19 12:51:13 <chrisb>	doc-view-pdftotext-program is set to pdftotext
Feb 19 12:51:22 <twb>	chrisb: according to my original notes I was aiming for 5y lifecycle and A$3000 TCO (= A$10/week)
Feb 19 12:52:03 <chrisb>	and doc-view-mode -c C-c renders pdf --> txt
Feb 19 12:52:04 <twb>	It's lasted ~9 years at A$9/week, including the new hub / wheel rebuild, which is the point where you tend to write off the entire bike
Feb 19 12:52:42 <chrisb>	twb: interesting...how does it work out it A$/mile cycled?
Feb 19 12:53:02 <twb>	A$0.14/km very roughly
Feb 19 12:53:21 <chrisb>	twb: so good
Feb 19 12:54:04 <twb>	Current TCO about A$9/week, if I had written it off in 2016 per original estimates, it would be A$14/week
Feb 19 12:55:10 <twb>	Hrm I think some of those numbers must be wrong
Feb 19 12:55:22 <twb>	No that's right.  it's dollars not cents.
Feb 19 12:58:59 <twb>	chrisb: http://ix.io/2c8d
Feb 19 12:59:14 <bremner>	oh. I was confused, I thought twb spend $3k on a computer
Feb 19 12:59:36 <twb>	bremner: no I normally spend about $350 on a computer which SHOULD be $200 but Australia Tax
Feb 19 13:00:15 <twb>	Although my last computer I got much better hardware for $1200 or something
Feb 19 13:00:47 <twb>	I still have't actually used that new laptop yet because ICBF switching
Feb 19 13:01:40 *	twb fucks off to get food and bed
Feb 19 13:06:20 <twb>	fledermaus: BTW I know you don't actually care, but mine is https://www.gazelle.nl/modellen/tour-populair with https://www.bumm.de/de/produkte/dynamo-scheinwerfer/parent/1786.html and Shimano Nexus 8 hub gear (haven't got it bookmarked)
Feb 19 13:07:19 <twb>	"Marin" appears to be a US make, which is like... what even?  They hate bicycles.
Feb 19 13:14:29 <mns>	For code completion, what is the better option,  company or auto-complete ?  Or some pointers to a cmoparison of the two.  For the moment my primary need is for Perl, Python, bash/sh, Groovy, Gradle, Maven, Ant, Make, Scheme, elisp, common lisp
Feb 19 13:16:48 <blandest>	mns: company
Feb 19 13:20:54 <montaropdf>	Which options/packages does Emacs propose to create files based on templates?
Feb 19 13:21:19 <mns>	montaropdf: yasnippet
Feb 19 13:21:20 <montaropdf>	I know of skeletor, but it is more for project creation than file creation from a template.
Feb 19 13:22:07 <montaropdf>	mns: To my knowledge,the file must be created already to use yasnippet, or there is some function I don't know about.
Feb 19 13:25:12 <mns>	montaropdf: I believe you can setup a key-binding that will run an elisp function in which you can use yasnippet programmatically.  yasnippet is the only templating package I know of.  If there are others, maybe they can be used in a similar fashion
Feb 19 13:26:38 <mns>	I am pretty sure that the JDEE package used to be able to create files, populated with certain basic imports for Java programming, etc.
Feb 19 13:26:38 <mns>	It was a simple key-chord and you had a new file
Feb 19 13:26:38 <montaropdf>	mns: so which function to use to tell yasnippet to use a particular template. I already look at it some times ago, without finding anything useful :/
Feb 19 13:27:36 <montaropdf>	Unfortunately I have to delay this discussion. I have a metting in a minute or so. See you later.
Feb 19 13:28:19 <mns>	montaropdf: you write your own function to do that.

Feb 19 14:01:22 <thblt>	Ignore the first attempt :)
Feb 19 14:02:01 <mns>	I always thought melpa and elpa were one and same lol.  
Feb 19 14:02:22 <mns>	I'll have to add elpa sources to my package list in that case.
Feb 19 14:02:23 <mns>	or should.

Feb 19 14:24:08 <praevalens>	I just started using eaf to have browser in emacs. There is nothing to open the url at a cursor in a buffer, so I'm trying to hack it myself. Problem is I've never really done elisp. I found that you can grab the url with thing-at-point. Now I'd like to patch the eaf-open-browser so it supplies thing-at-point as optional default parameter.I tried that but it didn't work: https://bpaste.net/J7BQ

Feb 28 21:55:24 <wasamasa>	are you volunteering to implement xpath properly?
Feb 28 21:58:22 <cvandusen>	rudybot: have you participated in the extensible games?
Feb 28 21:58:27 <rudybot>	cvandusen: I've never had one myself. I've just participated in the late-night revelry.
Feb 28 21:59:04 <cvandusen>	party hardy marty 
Feb 28 22:01:45 <Odin->	wasamasa: Isn't that one of those things that hardly anyone outside of Enterprise Software® touches?
Feb 28 22:01:58 <wasamasa>	you'd be surprised
Feb 28 22:02:06 <wasamasa>	xpath can do far better than css selectors
Feb 28 22:02:06 <bpalmer>	xpath is actually super-common.
Feb 28 22:02:14 <wasamasa>	I used to hate it
Feb 28 22:02:16 <bpalmer>	it's heavily used in javascript
Feb 28 22:02:33 <bpalmer>	now, xquery ...
Feb 28 22:02:38 <wasamasa>	in fact, lxml's implementation of css selectors compiles to xpath
Feb 28 22:02:55 <Odin->	wasamasa: Note that I wasn't trying to say "it's horrible and bad" by that.
Feb 28 22:03:04 <bpalmer>	ha, and XPointer ... I had forgotten about that.
Feb 28 22:03:21 <wasamasa>	Odin-: implementing it looks like a major pain, so I decided to ignore it
Feb 28 22:04:54 <Odin->	wasamasa: I think that's one of those things that causes some systems to become chiefly enterprise-y. People won't implement it out of interest or curiosity.
Feb 28 22:05:10 <wasamasa>	that didn't stop web standards
Feb 28 22:05:23 <wasamasa>	sure, keep believing it's a curiosity
Feb 28 22:05:40 <bpalmer>	basic, not-fully-compliant xpath isn't that hard to write, comparatively.
Feb 28 22:05:54 <bpalmer>	it's just parsing path expressions and attribute expressions.
Feb 28 22:06:05 <Odin->	wasamasa: 'a curiosity' is almost expressly what I'm saying it isn't.
Feb 28 22:06:19 <bpalmer>	sorry, given that you have a structured xml representation already.
Feb 28 22:06:23 <wasamasa>	"hardly anyone touches"
Feb 28 22:06:42 <Odin->	wasamasa: The 'outside of' clause to that is pretty significant.
Feb 28 22:06:52 <wasamasa>	what about browsers is enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:11 <wasamasa>	do you think userscripts are enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:23 <wasamasa>	are websites enterprise software?
Feb 28 22:07:41 <wasamasa>	look, I get it, you're trying to look edgy
Feb 28 22:07:54 <wasamasa>	it's bullshit, but I'll believe it
Feb 28 22:11:18 <Odin->	I say it because the only places I've seen specifically mention implementing it are various Java libraries and a couple of RDBMSs, both of which tend to be firmly linked to the "this code was written because of a contract and not because the programmer found the problem interesting" side of the fence.
Feb 28 22:11:30 <Odin->	Which, again, isn't actually a bad thing.
Feb 28 22:12:07 <python476>	bpalmer: X* star
Feb 28 22:12:09 <Odin->	I may well be ill informed, which is why I asked a question.
Feb 28 22:12:21 <wasamasa>	yeah, you might want to look at browsers
Feb 28 22:12:31 <wasamasa>	they've come a long way
Feb 28 22:12:32 <python476>	xpath, xpointer, xlink, xquery, xmi, exml
Feb 28 22:13:17 <bpalmer>	W3C recommendation doesn't mean a whole lot nowadays
Feb 28 22:13:33 <kenrestivo>	only google matters
Feb 28 22:13:35 <Odin->	wasamasa: Well, it's not exactly front and center in any web API documentation I've seen.
Feb 28 22:14:35 <Odin->	Huh.
Feb 28 22:14:52 <wasamasa>	anyway, here's the guide that made me reconsider things: https://genius.com/Mat-brown-xpath-is-actually-pretty-useful-once-it-stops-being-confusing-annotated
Feb 28 22:15:00 <kenrestivo>	rudybot:  c c "YOLO"
Feb 28 22:15:01 <rudybot>	kenrestivo: I got a working line in ielm with dolist: (dolist (x '("-c" "color.diff=false")) (add-to-list 'yolo x))
Feb 28 22:15:07 <Odin->	MDN docs on XPath explicitly say "there are no plans to improve support further".
Feb 28 22:15:12 <python476>	xmlschema, xxml, triplexml, xlisp <defun fact n=1><match n><with>n > 2</with><replace>n * <fact {{ n - 1 }}/></>
Feb 28 22:15:31 <wasamasa>	it still beats the support of the xpath thing on emacswiki
Feb 28 22:15:49 <wasamasa>	which is just enough to get twb's hopes up
Feb 28 22:16:14 <kenrestivo>	there's a clojure lib that does xpath-like selects on stuff. it's kinda useful
Feb 28 22:16:25 <Odin->	wasamasa: You still seem to conflate my initial comment with a belief that XPath is _bad_.
Feb 28 22:16:54 <wasamasa>	well, it's wrong
Feb 28 22:17:04 <wasamasa>	anything serious extracting stuff from documents uses xpath
Feb 28 22:17:16 <Odin->	Fair enough.
Feb 28 22:17:26 <wasamasa>	be it for downloading webcomics, scraping the web or just automating some website
Feb 28 22:17:30 <bpalmer>	from XML documents, that is.
Feb 28 22:17:45 <Odin->	Although my impression is also that XML documents are mostly an Enterprise® thing.
Feb 28 22:17:46 <bpalmer>	and something a lot like xpath for things a lot like xml
Feb 28 22:17:47 <wasamasa>	once the browser turned the html into a DOM, it doesn't matter
Feb 28 22:18:12 <wasamasa>	now, if I ever encounter tagsoup that libxml can't handle, I'll reconsider
Feb 28 22:18:37 <wasamasa>	go make my day with a valid epub breaking nov.el
Feb 28 22:20:49 <wasamasa>	speaking of which, I should push a new stable tag, assuming nothing broke by all the new features
Feb 28 22:21:17 <wasamasa>	I don't use it too much after all
Feb 28 22:22:12 <lesshaste>	what's the recommend way to use julia with emacs? Is there something that has REPL?
Feb 28 22:22:54 <bpalmer>	,julia
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	julia are [0/4] a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[1] Apparently like matlab, octave, R and stuff
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[2] at http://julialang.org/
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[3] details on the julia programming language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_%28programming_language%29
Feb 28 22:22:56 <fsbot>	[4] for Emacs support, see http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Julia
Feb 28 22:23:44 <lesshaste>	is that the same as https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs ?
Feb 28 22:23:52 <lesshaste>	if so, it seems to be hardly developed
Feb 28 22:24:21 <wasamasa>	not everything needs a daily update
Feb 28 22:24:29 <lesshaste>	https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-emacs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
Feb 28 22:24:35 <lesshaste>	true but that's one update ever it seems
Feb 28 22:24:47 <wasamasa>	it's kind of funny with your nick
Feb 28 22:24:52 <lesshaste>	:)
Feb 28 22:28:34 <lesshaste>	I have the julia major mode working
Feb 28 22:28:37 <lesshaste>	I want to get https://github.com/tpapp/julia-repl to work
Feb 28 22:29:08 <lesshaste>	http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/h7pHDGphpT/ is my .emacs
Feb 28 22:29:24 <lesshaste>	but M-x doesn't show julia-repl. How do I get it to work?
Feb 28 22:30:10 <wasamasa>	lol
Feb 28 22:30:20 <lesshaste>	what have I done wrong?
Feb 28 22:30:21 <wasamasa>	you have copied over the readme code as is
Feb 28 22:30:38 <wasamasa>	if you copy code saying path-to-something, you better replace it with a path to that thing
Feb 28 22:30:41 <lesshaste>	yep :)
Feb 28 22:30:51 <lesshaste>	let me fix that
Feb 28 22:30:57 <wasamasa>	anyway, that kind of stuff is not needed if you've installed it via package.el
Feb 28 22:31:09 <wasamasa>	package.el will set up load-path for you
Feb 28 22:31:18 <lesshaste>	wasamasa,  ok how do I do that?
Feb 28 22:31:41 <lesshaste>	I am using emacs 25 and julia major mode is working.. now... ?
Feb 28 22:31:43 <wasamasa>	same way you installed julia-mode
Feb 28 22:31:57 <lesshaste>	wasamasa, that was quite long and complicated and someone helped  me
Feb 28 22:32:07 <lesshaste>	I think it was via melpa
Feb 28 22:32:39 <wasamasa>	generally, do not place code requiring packages to be loaded up before package-initialize
Feb 28 22:32:50 <wasamasa>	that will not work unless you know what you're doing
Feb 28 22:33:24 <lesshaste>	M-x list-packages doesn't show any julia things
Feb 28 22:33:40 <wasamasa>	yeah, that's what they all say until they learn to search the list properly
Feb 28 22:33:48 <cvandusen>	What package archives do you have defined?
Feb 28 22:33:51 <wasamasa>	and then discover it's been installed already
Feb 28 22:34:14 <wasamasa>	or that their init file has errored out and package-archives is therefore not customized
Feb 28 22:34:16 <lesshaste>	cvandusen, I am not sure.. 
Feb 28 22:34:29 <wasamasa>	how one does that is a mystery to me, probably selective blindness
Feb 28 22:34:50 <lesshaste>	any help for how to get to stage 1 much appreciated
Feb 28 22:35:08 <wasamasa>	fix your init file first, then check the package list carefully
Feb 28 22:35:24 <lesshaste>	my .emacs is http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/t5w8sQBKbY/
Feb 28 22:35:30 <lesshaste>	is that OK?
Feb 28 22:35:40 <wasamasa>	<wasamasa> generally, do not place code requiring packages to be loaded up before package-initialize
Feb 28 22:35:59 <wasamasa>	the very first line is such code
Feb 28 22:36:15 <lesshaste>	and the (require 'package) line too?
Feb 28 22:36:15 <wasamasa>	unless you install emacs packages via apt, then nobody but twb can help you
Feb 28 22:36:17 <wasamasa>	no
Feb 28 22:36:29 <lesshaste>	ok so I will move the first line to the end?
Feb 28 22:36:37 <wasamasa>	try to get at least a cursory understanding of what the code does
Feb 28 22:37:41 <lesshaste>	 julia-mode         20191225.858  installed
Feb 28 22:37:46 <wasamasa>	see
Feb 28 22:37:51 <wasamasa>	it is there after all
Feb 28 22:37:58 <lesshaste>	I was looking for julia-repl
Feb 28 22:38:04 <lesshaste>	which is a minor mode apparently
Feb 28 22:38:07 <wasamasa>	I'm sure you'll find it eventually
Feb 28 22:38:12 <lesshaste>	it's not there :)
Feb 28 22:38:20 <wasamasa>	after all it has a melpa badge
Feb 28 22:38:21 <lesshaste>	unless ctrl-s isn't working
Feb 28 22:38:35 <lesshaste>	 elpy               1.22.0        installed
Feb 28 22:38:36 <wasamasa>	you may need to hit it again to wrap around
Feb 28 22:39:09 <lesshaste>	absent
Feb 28 22:39:39 <lesshaste>	do you see it?
Feb 28 22:39:55 <wasamasa>	I don't use melpa directly
Feb 28 22:40:01 <lesshaste>	ah ok
Feb 28 22:40:43 <wasamasa>	https://melpa.org/packages/archive-contents
Feb 28 22:40:56 <wasamasa>	it is in that list
Feb 28 22:41:11 <wasamasa>	so once your emacs fetched that list successfully, it will appear for you
Feb 28 22:42:01 <wasamasa>	hit r for to refetch it
Feb 28 22:43:24 <lesshaste>	I am going to give up for now but thanks for the help. I just want to write some julia code and can find another way to do it
Feb 28 22:43:39 <wasamasa>	like running a repl from M-x shell?
Feb 28 22:43:48 <lesshaste>	(I hit r from the list-packages screen but it didn't do much)
Feb 28 22:44:07 <wasamasa>	also, check your local copy of that file
Feb 28 22:44:19 <lesshaste>	local copy of which file?
Feb 28 22:44:32 <wasamasa>	~/.emacs.d/elpa/archives/melpa/archive-contents
Feb 28 22:45:58 <lesshaste>	hmm.. that does have more julia stuff in it
Feb 28 22:46:15 <lesshaste>	curious I didn't see it from emacs. Maybe it hadn't loaded the elpa packages at all to list?
Feb 28 22:46:26 <lesshaste>	was I maybe looking at some default non-elpa list?
Feb 28 22:46:46 <wasamasa>	start a new emacs instance and try again
Feb 28 22:47:06 <wasamasa>	honestly, most of the time it's people not searching properly or ignoring some blatant error message from their init file
Feb 28 22:47:36 <lesshaste>	there may well be an error message. Are they logged somewhere?
Feb 28 22:48:20 <wasamasa>	there's a messages buffer
Feb 28 22:48:25 <wasamasa>	errors pop up into a window
Feb 28 22:48:32 <wasamasa>	especially the init file kind
Feb 28 22:48:54 <lesshaste>	no errors in the messages buffer
Feb 28 22:48:59 <lesshaste>	ok now I do have to go. Thanks again
Feb 28 22:49:03 <lesshaste>	I'll try again another day
Feb 28 22:49:18 <cvandusen>	,delayed-next 
Feb 28 22:49:20 <fsbot>	If We sent down the angels and caused the dead to speak with them, and ranged all things before them, they would still not believe, Unless EMACS willed it.  But most of them are ignorant men.

Feb 29 15:35:42 <mekeor>	hello. can i somehow start an irc-client on my server and then connect to it with my emacs from my laptop or so? so that i'd have the logs and i'm always logged in…?
Feb 29 15:44:23 <illili>	mekeor: you could emacsclient into a running server via ssh
Feb 29 15:46:36 <mekeor>	thanks and goodbye, illili
Feb 29 16:01:34 <kleisli>	anyone know the best way to bind a key to a keymap (for example if I wanted M-h to have the same behavior as C-h)?

Feb 29 16:10:26 <assemblyPL_>	sorry for typo
Feb 29 16:11:32 <assemblyPL_>	I will rephrase my question
Feb 29 16:13:08 <assemblyPL_>	How to have Emacs not interpret sent Ctrl keysa
Feb 29 16:13:49 <assemblyPL_>	How to have Emacs not interpret sent Ctrl keys as commands to itself without changing what key sends what key.
Feb 29 16:14:01 <assemblyPL_>	Is this possible?
Feb 29 16:14:18 <wasamasa>	you forgot to mention that this is about exwm ultimately
Feb 29 16:16:03 <assemblyPL_>	without disabling the C-x functionality
Feb 29 16:16:42 <assemblyPL_>	no, ultimately it is about Emacs <--> any other program compatibility. 
Feb 29 16:48:27 <grym>	assemblyPL_: rebind your keyboard's winkey to another control 
Feb 29 16:49:03 <grym>	i don't know how to do that per-application or even if it's possible

Feb 29 17:14:09 <Illya>	How do I prevent tramp from completely locking up my emacs when changing networks? When a server disappears it retries to connect infintely, completely locking up interaction entirely. (C-g spam kills the process eventually but then it restarts)
Feb 29 17:37:21 <JohanP>	magit is missing a bunch of files in the unstaged changes section (shows up with git status). what could be the reason for this?
Feb 29 17:41:43 <mplsCorwin>	JohanP: did you already try refreshing the magit status buffer with "g" ?
Feb 29 17:47:36 <JohanP>	yes many times
Feb 29 17:47:55 <JohanP>	also tried restarting emacs 
Feb 29 17:49:14 <mplsCorwin>	Sorry JohanP :(  I wish I had something more helpful to suggest.  Am at the "enough to be dangerous" level with git
Feb 29 17:49:35 <JohanP>	mplsCorwin: ok, thanks anyways
Feb 29 17:49:42 <offby1>	JohanP: might they be "collapsed"?  magit lets you hide stuff by hitting TAB on the header line

Feb 29 17:51:39 <JohanP>	i suspected some interference from gerrit.el, but i have disabled that now
Feb 29 17:51:40 <offby1>	you're _sure_ magit is looking at the same git work tree that you are, when you run git on the command line?
Feb 29 17:52:21 <offby1>	is your "git" command perhaps aliased to something weird?
Feb 29 17:52:46 <JohanP>	offby1: i am 100% sure it's the same worktree
Feb 29 17:53:23 <JohanP>	and i know some unstaged files are missing, bc i just edited them
Feb 29 17:54:41 <shrysr>	using pyenv - is it possible to have a set virtualenv for a buffer / project?
Feb 29 17:57:06 <shrysr>	mebbe what I mean is use multiple active python env, without a manual activate.
Feb 29 17:58:40 <shrysr>	hmm docs indicate pyenv support per project python versions. rtfm .. leemmeee dive.

Feb 29 18:53:19 <rgr_>	current prefix arg is 4 for both.
Feb 29 18:56:50 <edgar-rft>	rgr_: look at the digit-argument and universal-argument functions in simple.el to see the difference

Feb 29 19:11:41 <wasamasa>	C-u sets the prefix argument to something that can be interpreted as 4 or as a single hit of the C-u key
Feb 29 19:11:48 <wasamasa>	whereas with C-4 only the former is possible
Feb 29 19:17:25 <rgr_>	and how do I tell the difference in code between C-u and C-4 being pressed prior to invoking a fn?
Feb 29 19:18:01 <rgr_>	I must admit I have a terrible mental block with prefix stuff. It seems kind of a hacked mess but thats just me not getting it I guess.
Feb 29 19:32:09 <wasamasa>	you look at the raw prefix value
Feb 29 19:32:20 <wasamasa>	if you've ever used (interactive "P"), it puts it there for you

Mar 02 12:41:35 <wasamasa>	,tias
Mar 02 12:41:36 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Mar 02 12:41:47 <wasamasa>	the manual has other pages than that
Mar 02 12:41:50 <wasamasa>	look at them
Mar 02 12:41:53 <afidegnum>	no it works for only a single org project and folder
Mar 02 12:42:02 <afidegnum>	but i have multiple projecs scattered
Mar 02 12:43:30 <afidegnum>	and i want to have multiple themes for them
Mar 02 12:44:22 <wasamasa>	it's an alist, so you can have more than one entry
Mar 02 12:44:35 <wasamasa>	how do you change the theme anyway?
Mar 02 12:45:30 <afidegnum>	i think i had to insert +HEAD:
Mar 02 12:45:45 <afidegnum>	but i have to look into that
Mar 02 12:46:04 <afidegnum>	because when i followed the guide earlier, the old settings still interfere
Mar 02 12:46:05 <wasamasa>	you mean, +HTML_HEAD: ?
Mar 02 12:46:13 <afidegnum>	yes
Mar 02 12:46:17 <wasamasa>	because there's a suspiciously named option like that in the example
Mar 02 12:46:35 <wasamasa>	just add one more entry to the alist with the same option, but a different value
Mar 02 12:46:41 <afidegnum>	i used this instead   #+STYLE: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
Mar 02 12:48:23 <wasamasa>	that's not in the manual either
Mar 02 12:48:34 <wasamasa>	figure out the correct options first, then study the manual about them
Mar 02 12:48:43 <wasamasa>	it's there for a reason
Mar 02 12:49:16 <afidegnum>	here is the generated html file, https://dpaste.org/xE0u  how do i replace i.e <div id="outline-container-org132c92b" class="outline-2"> with my custom class? 
Mar 02 12:51:37 <quiliro>	kodein: https://podcastle.org/2009/10/09/pc-miniature-38-accounting-for-dragons/
Mar 02 12:53:12 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: can you please throw some light on the style change part ?
Mar 02 12:53:27 <afidegnum>	i mean element properties change
Mar 02 12:56:22 <wasamasa>	sorry, but you're missing out on some lisp basics
Mar 02 12:56:32 <wasamasa>	if you don't understand what an alist is I can't help you
Mar 02 12:57:28 <afidegnum>	i know alist
Mar 02 12:57:56 <afidegnum>	association list
Mar 02 12:58:58 <wasamasa>	yes, but do you actually understand what that means?
Mar 02 13:00:01 <afidegnum>	it associate symbols with another symbol 
Mar 02 13:00:09 <wasamasa>	wrong
Mar 02 13:00:12 <afidegnum>	i.e ((pine . cones) (oak . acorns) (maple . seeds))
Mar 02 13:00:39 <wasamasa>	look at that customizable, there's no symbol keys or values
Mar 02 13:00:47 <afidegnum>	list containing symbol pairs
Mar 02 13:01:38 <wasamasa>	look at org-publish-project-alist and tell me, what kind of keys and values does it have?
Mar 02 13:03:11 <afidegnum>	i.e :base-directory "~/org/" :base-extension "org" :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/" :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
Mar 02 13:05:09 <wasamasa>	wrong
Mar 02 13:05:15 <wasamasa>	you don't understand alists at all
Mar 02 13:05:21 <afidegnum>	?
Mar 02 13:06:14 <wasamasa>	the correct answer is that this alist has a string key "org" and a list value (:base-directory "~/org" ...)
Mar 02 13:06:46 <afidegnum>	ok, i have taken note
Mar 02 13:06:48 <wasamasa>	if you want to have another project, you'll need to provide another alist entry with a string key and a list value
Mar 02 13:06:56 <quiliro>	isn't that a symbol pair?
Mar 02 13:07:09 <wasamasa>	a string isn't a symbol and a list isn't a symbol either
Mar 02 13:07:20 <wasamasa>	alists often have symbols for keys, yes, but not always
Mar 02 13:08:17 <wasamasa>	the list value resembles a plist which is a list with alternating key and value items
Mar 02 13:08:26 <wasamasa>	with keys typically being keywords
Mar 02 13:09:24 <afidegnum>	ok, i was targeting the inner elements that's why
Mar 02 13:09:36 <quiliro>	what is the difference between a key and a keyword?
Mar 02 13:09:59 <wasamasa>	a keyword is a type, a key is a name for something you use to look up a pair in a key-value data structure
Mar 02 13:10:23 <wasamasa>	alists and plists are two commonly used key-value data structures in many lisp dialects
Mar 02 13:10:49 <parsnip>	perhaps s/a keyword is a type/keyword is a type/
Mar 02 13:10:50 <wasamasa>	afidegnum: it's crucial to understand what an alist is before messing around with plists in their values
Mar 02 13:12:23 <afidegnum>	ok, i m learning gradually 
Mar 02 13:15:28 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: is it possible to set up a prompt per project to enter custom parameters to org-publish-project-alist ?
Mar 02 13:16:01 <wasamasa>	it depends on how much of a masochist you are
Mar 02 13:16:08 <wasamasa>	I wouldn't bother
Mar 02 13:16:16 <wasamasa>	just edit that variable and republish
Mar 02 13:18:39 <afidegnum>	the reason why i'm asking is instead of manually edit init.el on each project creation to assign custom themes and other configs, i was thiking of there is another way to make life easier
Mar 02 13:19:07 <wasamasa>	it doesn't really make your life easier
Mar 02 13:19:30 <wasamasa>	you either edit a sexp with the full support of your text editor or you edit it with poor support of your text editor
Mar 02 13:20:19 <wasamasa>	you will put in lots of effort for barely of an improvement in UX, if at all
Mar 02 13:21:17 <afidegnum>	hmm... 
Mar 02 13:21:53 <afidegnum>	what do you suggest ?
Mar 02 13:22:01 <wasamasa>	<wasamasa> I wouldn't bother
Mar 02 13:29:36 <terzievk>	I installed ghc with pacman and haskell-mode on emacs. Now when I open a .hs the following error pops up in the minibuffer: Could not find module ‘Prelude’
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	There are files missing in the ‘base-4.13.0.0’ package,
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	try running 'ghc-pkg check'.
Mar 02 13:29:37 <terzievk>	Use -v (or `:set -v` in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for.
Mar 02 13:29:40 <terzievk>	 
Mar 02 13:31:40 <terzievk>	What should I do?
Mar 02 13:35:41 <edgar-rft>	buy me a drink
Mar 02 13:37:06 <terzievk>	I might if it helps, but I don't think it will
Mar 02 13:37:50 <edgar-rft>	don't think, pay
Mar 02 13:38:28 <wasamasa>	it suggests you what commands to run
Mar 02 13:38:33 <wasamasa>	why don't you do that
Mar 02 13:38:39 <wasamasa>	rudybot: like all other men do
Mar 02 13:38:44 <rudybot>	wasamasa: pfft, reading Dworkin doesn't make me feel like a monster, it reaffirms my inner feelings about all the other men being monsters, making me feel sane and understood
Mar 02 13:41:16 <terzievk>	wasamasa: becuase it list numerous warnings like haddock-html ... isn't a file
Mar 02 13:42:40 <wasamasa>	see if you can fix them
Mar 02 13:45:59 <terzievk>	edgar-rft: post names and address and I might
Mar 02 13:47:04 <terzievk>	edgar-rft: send some beer your way
Mar 02 13:48:10 <csed>	Ok uh, anyone know how to limit how much space lsp-mode takes up when expanding on function docs?
Mar 02 13:48:25 <csed>	Because it legit just took over like, 95% of my screen for open() docs.
Mar 02 13:54:31 <parsnip>	sorry, i drank it
Mar 02 14:01:44 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: if i understand, to publish org-html i need to set my .init.el with org-publish-project-alist, then add #+STYLE: for my custom style, how do i change the theme ?
Mar 02 14:01:53 <afidegnum>	any writeup i can refer to ?
Mar 02 14:02:23 <wasamasa>	please read the manual
Mar 02 14:02:37 <wasamasa>	it tells you what options org knows
Mar 02 14:39:44 <afidegnum>	i give up
Mar 02 14:49:28 <mplsCorwin>	afidegnum: did you read this page? https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html
Mar 02 14:50:55 <wasamasa>	not to forget https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing-options.html
Mar 02 14:52:00 <wasamasa>	there's considerable overlap between both manual pages
Mar 02 15:02:52 <alephnull>	wasamasa: I caught your hangout with sachac yesterday. Nice stuff, the calendar was particularly eye-opening.
Mar 02 15:11:34 <loskutak>	alephnull: is that available somewhere?
Mar 02 15:11:49 <alephnull>	YouTube
Mar 02 15:12:23 <alephnull>	Its from 2015, iirc
Mar 02 15:14:46 <loskutak>	oh I thought there is some new one
Mar 02 15:18:52 <wasamasa>	what calendar?
Mar 02 15:58:48 <yates>	,, shell-command-on-region
Mar 02 15:58:49 <fsbot>	ERROR: This looks like a large search. TODO: search as a string instead of regex and prefix result with [LargeSearch]

Mar 02 15:59:06 <fsbot>	Nooo!  This looks like a large search. TODO: search as a string instead of regex and prefix result with [LargeSearch]
Mar 02 15:59:54 <wasamasa>	I'm not sure why you expect it to be any different on the second attempt
Mar 02 16:01:03 <yates>	the help for the command shell-command-on-region it states "Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input". so under linux would that result in a "cat region | COMMAND" type of construct?
Mar 02 16:01:36 <wasamasa>	more like COMMAND < region
Mar 02 16:02:12 <yates>	ok
Mar 02 16:02:21 <wasamasa>	but yes
Mar 02 16:02:47 <yates>	btw wasamasa the second ",," is not identical - there is one less " " (space)

Mar 02 16:03:18 <yates>	ok... 
Mar 02 16:03:33 <wasamasa>	you want ,,df shell-command-on-region
Mar 02 16:03:34 <fsbot>	shell-command-on-region is an interactive compiled Lisp function in

Mar 02 16:03:47 <yates>	aha. thanks!
Mar 02 16:04:41 <wasamasa>	otherwise the thing after the comma is interpreted as fsbot command

Mar 02 16:04:58 <wasamasa>	and it's not a valid search term for the wiki either, so it fails
Mar 02 16:05:15 <yates>	i see (said the blind man...)
Mar 02 16:09:20 <yates>	btw, is the hexl-mode command written in C? it takes awhile to render large files (256M-ish)
Mar 02 16:09:43 *	shrysr waves at wasamasa .. found the alist thread instructive.. ty. i gotta rtfm moaaar
Mar 02 16:11:00 <wasamasa>	hexl-mode is written in elisp and calls the hexl program
Mar 02 16:12:53 <wasamasa>	performance issues are most likely its use of overlays
Mar 02 16:12:56 <wasamasa>	try nhexl-mode

Mar 18 12:42:06 *	Topic for #emacs set by jrm!~jrm@freebsd/developer/jrm (Thu Mar  5 14:56:35 2020)
Mar 18 12:42:06 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Mar 18 12:52:38 <thblt>	Yesterday in the vegetables stand of the food market, the sellers were forbidding people to touch the food themselves, and instead would pick and pack food for them.  From a strictly prophylactic perspective, it seems grossly inefficient, since they would certainly get contaminated by money, then in turn contaminate the food. Opinions, #emacs?
Mar 18 12:52:51 <thblt>	OTOH of cours, it helps carry the message that something important is happening.
Mar 18 12:53:40 <quiliro>	The person that touches the money should not touch the food.
Mar 18 12:55:00 <quiliro>	Maybe using a different hand for each as the indians do for the toilet, would be appropriate.
Mar 18 12:56:05 <thblt>	Maybe they could have done this. I wonder if they were acting on official instructions.
Mar 18 12:56:13 <quiliro>	Another strategy could be maybe touching the money with ta tool instead of with the hands.
Mar 18 12:56:31 <quiliro>	s/ta/a/
Mar 18 12:57:16 <thblt>	Yeah, maybe.  I have a feeling the best approach would be to do business as usual (clients pick their food) but tell people to *really* clean it up.
Mar 18 12:57:44 <quiliro>	But all in all, the problem of transmission of diseases by contact is not new. Why paralyze entire countries when there are much greater numbers of deaths for other reasons.
Mar 18 12:57:45 <thblt>	But it lacks the dramatic element which may have been the important part there.
Mar 18 12:58:30 <thblt>	Deaths are not the issue, respirators are, ER beds too.  
Mar 18 12:58:43 <thblt>	(From what I've gathered.)
Mar 18 12:59:01 <loskutak>	Hi, I have to work from home due to coronavirus and my connection is not very good. Whenever the connection fails, emacs freezes completely and I don't know what to do about that. Pressing (even multiple times, ore even holding) C-g does not help. Sending emacs SIGUSR2 signal does not help either... Any ideas? Maybe tweaking some tramp setting?
Mar 18 12:59:47 <quiliro>	But countries spend large sums of money for other areas, they do it immediately. They could easily buy those resources if it meant money for them.
Mar 18 13:01:20 <thblt>	quiliro: The issue is production capabilities too.  France has started deploying military field hospitals, but equipement is a huge issue. 
Mar 18 13:01:22 <quiliro>	loskutak: i have noticed the same problem for other reasons with Emacs freezing when some process is not complete also.
Mar 18 13:01:52 <thblt>	(Again, there are real experts if you want real advice :), that's what I've understood, and it seems to make sense)
Mar 18 13:02:03 <quiliro>	I was amazed by the chinese constructing a giant hospital in just a couple of weeks!
Mar 18 13:02:37 <thblt>	You can probably buy hospitals on AliExpress now.
Mar 18 13:02:48 <quiliro>	It is possible. Just politicians and corporations are not interested.
Mar 18 13:02:50 <loskutak>	I don't even know how to pinpoint the exact call that causes this freezing :/
Mar 18 13:03:19 <quiliro>	loskutak: maybe you can debug-on-error
Mar 18 13:04:36 <quiliro>	or just debug or debug-on-entry for tramp
Mar 18 13:04:43 <loskutak>	quiliro: But it seems there is no error... I have tried debug-on-quit, but I just cannot get emacs to quit the action it is doing, so that doesn't seem to help either
Mar 18 13:05:14 <quiliro>	loskutak: how did it go for debug-on-entry
Mar 18 13:05:18 <quiliro>	?
Mar 18 13:06:03 <loskutak>	quiliro: well when emacs is ok, this wont help I guess... When it is frozen, I cannot debug-on-entry
Mar 18 13:06:28 <quiliro>	but you can see what happened just before
Mar 18 13:08:12 <quiliro>	loskutak: what do you use tramp for? maybe you can make a copy of files with git, if it is just editing files. you could just ssh, if you are running processes. other solutions for other processes, etc
Mar 18 13:08:39 <quiliro>	I think the problem with Emacs is that it is not multithread.
Mar 18 13:08:56 <quiliro>	So it must finisc one thing before it deos the next.
Mar 18 13:09:21 <quiliro>	s/finisc/finish/
Mar 18 13:10:34 <thblt>	loskutak: You may also try sshfs if you're on Linux, or git, or scp, or rsync… If it's an exceptional situation you don't need a perfect solution.
Mar 18 13:12:08 <quiliro>	I think this coronavirus pandemic is not more tragic than high blood pressure or even glaucoma. I think it is bad for those that have the virus more because of the discrimination. But the whole population is affected by the constraints even more.
Mar 18 13:13:56 <quiliro>	I think more deaths and sickness are caused by the constraints and the poverty caused than by the virus in the worst circumstance. I think it is an economic issue for the rich. But of course, this is just a hunch. i have not made an investigation. All I know is that it does not smell good.
Mar 18 13:14:09 <quiliro>	It sounds like a scam.
Mar 18 13:14:22 <quiliro>	...a very well planned scam.
Mar 18 13:15:59 <quiliro>	But i am not certain
Mar 18 13:17:50 <quiliro>	wasamasa told me yesterday to investigate the effects of esxml-query on my xml file which is embedded on an another xml. I will try to understand how that function works. Will test it with a simpler xml file.

Mar 18 13:41:07 <quiliro>	loskutak: I think that a cable will make a better connection than wireless. Never know if it will be solved just by that.
Mar 18 13:42:32 <quiliro>	I can never copy and paste from pdf files. They are not displayed as text, but as images with DocView
Mar 18 13:42:50 <loskutak>	quiliro: the issue is that my internet connection is wireless and I cannot easily quickly change that. The home wifi works ok and there is not much difference between wifi and cable on my LAN.
Mar 18 13:43:09 <wasamasa>	quiliro: do you understand how xml documents are represented as trees?
Mar 18 13:43:32 <quiliro>	loskutak: Oh...You use a WISP.
Mar 18 13:43:36 <wasamasa>	quiliro: do you understand how css selectors work?
Mar 18 13:43:40 <quiliro>	wasamasa: yes
Mar 18 13:43:47 <quiliro>	tags inside of tags
Mar 18 13:44:02 <quiliro>	with those being branches of branches
Mar 18 13:44:33 <quiliro>	i don't know what css selectors are
Mar 18 13:44:40 <wasamasa>	well, then you've got some learning to do
Mar 18 13:44:41 <quiliro>	i will investigate
Mar 18 13:44:55 <wasamasa>	once you understand both, you should have no issues with that library
Mar 18 13:45:25 <quiliro>	ok...thanks for guiding
Mar 18 13:48:21 <wasamasa>	but yeah, it's a good idea to experiment with a simpler xml document
Mar 18 13:52:15 <jmd>	Is there a way I can put some special filter/postprocessing in the *compilation* buffer ?
Mar 18 13:54:52 <quiliro>	CSS selectors are just selected style patterns
Mar 18 13:55:33 <quiliro>	never used named them as such ...but I can recognize them in the files.
Mar 18 13:55:34 <wasamasa>	if you can write css selectors that match the part of the xml document you're interested in, you're good to go
Mar 18 13:57:03 <quiliro>	I can ...I see you did when you wrote: (esxml-query "comprobante>factura>detalles" xml)
Mar 18 13:57:24 <quiliro>	and I can see the tree is that way on my xml file
Mar 18 13:58:06 <quiliro>	comprobante is the bigger branch from which factura emerges ... and detalles emerges from factura
Mar 18 13:59:12 <quiliro>	But I got nothing if I execute that command or even one created by me:
Mar 18 13:59:27 <wasamasa>	then the query doesn't match anything in that document
Mar 18 14:00:08 <quiliro>	it does
Mar 18 14:00:23 <wasamasa>	at some point you
Mar 18 14:00:25 <quiliro>	but maybe the xml file is not recognized because of CDATA
Mar 18 14:00:33 <wasamasa>	I mean, at some point you've made a mistake then
Mar 18 14:00:53 <wasamasa>	yes, matching isn't done inside cdata because cdata is a way to quote text in a xml document
Mar 18 14:01:04 <wasamasa>	that quoted text isn't its own tree you can perform matching on
Mar 18 14:01:17 <wasamasa>	it's text you have to extract, parse and process
Mar 18 14:02:27 <quiliro>	ok...will try now....thanks for your pointers, wasamasa 
Mar 18 14:16:05 <thblt>	amosbird: no idea. There's a package called unfill to do the unfilling, but de-hyphenating is impossible, unless the PDF uses a different character for the hyphenation dash.  
Mar 18 14:22:44 <loskutak>	oh my gosh, I think I will mostly stop using tramp. Working on localhost and then rsyncing to the remote is so frigging fast :D
Mar 18 14:23:07 <wasamasa>	yeah, that
Mar 18 14:23:19 <wasamasa>	I wrote a package to do anything I want on save to help with that part
Mar 18 14:25:30 <loskutak>	firestarter?
Mar 18 14:25:31 <fsbot>	I think firestarter is [0] https://github.com/wasamasa/firestarter
Mar 18 14:25:31 <fsbot>	[1] Execute (shell) commands on save
Mar 18 14:25:46 <jmd>	I can't seem to get compilation-parse-errors-filename-function to work as documented.
Mar 18 14:25:52 <jmd>	(or at all)
Mar 18 14:26:00 <jmd>	Is there a trick to it?
Mar 18 14:26:28 <dustfinger>	I use exwm and am constantly working. I would like to slowly re-write my emacs config. Is there a safe way to reload the config, while running exwm so that I don't have to close all my buffers inbetween?
Mar 18 14:26:53 <python476>	thblt: first time I realize the purpose of having different dash
Mar 18 14:28:08 <grym>	wasamasa: i think that solves an org rendering want i've been having for a while, thanks 
Mar 18 14:30:34 <quiliro>	What is ROOT in (esxml-query SELECTOR ROOT) ? the highest level branch, or the branch directly above SELECTOR?
Mar 18 14:30:45 <wasamasa>	a XML node
Mar 18 14:31:06 <amosbird>	thblt: is "de-hyphenating" a word?
Mar 18 14:31:13 <quiliro>	wasamasa: I understand that
Mar 18 14:31:23 <quiliro>	oh!
Mar 18 14:31:47 <AimHere>	amosbird, if it isn't, the meaning would be obvious enough that if you started using it, everyone would know what you meant and you'd make a new word
Mar 18 14:32:08 <AimHere>	So I wouldn't worry about whether it is or not. 
Mar 18 14:32:11 <quiliro>	I will investigate what is the diffence between selector and node
Mar 18 14:35:23 <parsnip>	ugh, crappy bug report is crappy? https://github.com/bradyt/dart-mode/issues/109
Mar 18 14:35:36 <parsnip>	this... doesn't even have anything to do with dart-mode
Mar 18 14:35:45 <loskutak>	wasamasa: thanks for the firestarter, that is super useful
Mar 18 14:35:52 <parsnip>	also... what kind of reproduce is that?
Mar 18 14:35:58 <parsnip>	"i pressed some button, bad happened"
Mar 18 14:36:28 <parsnip>	i hate getting shitty bug reports from people who are payed by google
Mar 18 14:36:40 <parsnip>	why the fuck am i maintaining a google plugin?
Mar 18 14:37:58 <wasamasa>	why the fuck are you dealing with google software
Mar 18 14:38:25 <wasamasa>	funny, I've got a bug report by the same user
Mar 18 14:38:27 <thblt>	python476: I *think* some PDF generators do smarter things, like dropping the hyphen AND the \n in the text layer, or just putting the unhyphenated word there.  But I don't know which ones.  
Mar 18 14:39:33 <wasamasa>	parsnip: what makes you think they're a googler?

Mar 18 15:55:57 <parsnip>	"sorry, no open issues without a pull request"
Mar 18 15:58:56 <python476>	yesterday saw a lot more patches
Mar 18 15:58:56 <npostavs>	parsnip: I don't think that is a reasonable interpration of the post.
Mar 18 15:59:05 <python476>	confinement supports open source software
Mar 18 15:59:49 <parsnip>	npostavs: how so?
Mar 18 16:00:15 <parsnip>	the issue persists, the issue is closed, and they said they prefer a PR
Mar 18 16:01:10 <npostavs>	parsnip: yes, *prefer* a PR, not that issues without PRs are disallowed
Mar 18 16:01:22 <parsnip>	the issue is still closed
Mar 18 16:15:00 <parsnip>	why was it closed in the first place
Mar 18 16:15:16 <quiliro>	I used (esxml-query "head" "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en-US\"> ....") , but I got nil
Mar 18 16:15:31 <wasamasa>	you forgot the parsing step
Mar 18 16:15:36 <wasamasa>	it won't work on strings
Mar 18 16:15:45 <wasamasa>	it's why it's named esxml
Mar 18 16:15:54 <wasamasa>	it works on a particular kind of s-expressions, coined esxml
Mar 18 16:16:12 <quiliro>	what does parsing mean? will check the Emacs manual
Mar 18 16:16:27 <quiliro>	will also look what is esxml
Mar 18 16:16:28 <wasamasa>	turning a string into a parse tree
Mar 18 16:16:49 <quiliro>	will  also look what a parse tree is
Mar 18 16:17:14 <npostavs>	parsnip: yeah, that's a good question.  It seems the OP never explained why they closed it.
Mar 18 16:17:39 <wasamasa>	going from "<foo>bar</foo>" to (foo nil "bar")
Mar 18 16:17:45 <parsnip>	i tried to draft a PR a couple weeks ago, but ran into an issue, so somehow i felt we should just open it
Mar 18 16:18:11 <parsnip>	but apparently i have to write up a freakin' thesis to have an issue opened
Mar 18 16:18:27 <parsnip>	whereas, _there's no reason for it to be closed_
Mar 18 16:18:48 <parsnip>	i think the internet has the flu
Mar 18 16:19:00 <parsnip>	you all need to go back to bed
Mar 18 16:19:03 <quiliro>	so I will need libxml-parse-xml-region
Mar 18 16:19:13 <quiliro>	to parse the string
Mar 18 16:19:18 <quiliro>	is that right?
Mar 18 16:19:23 <wasamasa>	I'm mildly curious how long until you've got all of this figured out
Mar 18 16:19:33 <wasamasa>	we've went over these topics a bunch of times
Mar 18 16:19:54 <quiliro>	it is just that is was much more complicated for me before
Mar 18 16:20:15 <wasamasa>	and it's not just me, but other people from this channel
Mar 18 16:20:16 <quiliro>	it is still a little difficult, but I understand a little more
Mar 18 16:20:33 <quiliro>	i have been reading elisp intro
Mar 18 16:20:55 <quiliro>	I am almost half way through
Mar 18 16:21:13 <quiliro>	and read some of Xah lee's elisp intro
Mar 18 16:21:54 <quiliro>	have been using describe-function with your script too
Mar 18 16:22:21 <quiliro>	Is there anything else to do. Am I not following the correct process?
Mar 18 16:22:47 <quiliro>	Perhaps the examples were too complicated for my starter level
Mar 18 16:23:04 <quiliro>	and that made it take more time to understand
Mar 18 16:23:20 <quiliro>	I got a lot from elisp intro
Mar 18 16:23:48 <quiliro>	which I started reading lately. I even printed it.
Mar 18 16:26:14 <wasamasa>	the understanding part is crucial
Mar 18 16:26:50 <quiliro>	haha
Mar 18 16:26:55 <quiliro>	of course
Mar 18 16:27:36 <quiliro>	for me it was very difficult to understand your example because I did not understand the basics of elisp
Mar 18 16:27:44 <quiliro>	I did everything i was told
Mar 18 16:27:59 <quiliro>	But did not read the elisp intro
Mar 18 16:28:37 <quiliro>	i was reading the source, but that was confusing at first without the concepts presented by that manual
Mar 18 16:29:31 <quiliro>	anyway, if it is too cumbersome, I will refrain from asking until I spend at least a week with a question.
Mar 18 16:29:53 <quiliro>	will that be better?
Mar 18 16:30:26 <wasamasa>	whatever works for you
Mar 18 16:31:23 <cvandusen>	You might set smaller goals. It's not unlike someone new to Emacs/Elisp and deciding to write a major mode.
Mar 18 16:31:26 <wasamasa>	it just doesn't seem like you're making progress
Mar 18 16:31:40 <quiliro>	what has worked has been asking immediately...I have learned a lot. But it seems too heavy weight for you
Mar 18 16:31:53 <wasamasa>	you are currently struggling with basic buffer manipulation and ask for stuff based on that
Mar 18 16:32:06 <quiliro>	that is what i am learning
Mar 18 16:32:15 <quiliro>	buffer manipulation
Mar 18 16:32:35 <wasamasa>	then you'll have to learn common constructs like using temporary variables and loops
Mar 18 16:32:35 <quiliro>	but i cannot find info regarding that
Mar 18 16:32:41 <quiliro>	ok
Mar 18 16:32:45 <wasamasa>	that's like the only topic in eintr
Mar 18 16:32:50 <quiliro>	thank you for the pointers
Mar 18 16:33:26 <quiliro>	well, almost the whole of eintr has been very insightful for me
Mar 18 16:33:45 <quiliro>	up to the point I am at now
Mar 18 16:38:31 <parsnip>	this day has started out horribly, _because people are talking to me_
Mar 18 16:38:45 <parsnip>	what happened to social distancing? i thought this would go better for me.
Mar 18 16:39:57 <parsnip>	break the problem into smaller parts
Mar 18 16:40:22 <hodapp>	HEY PARTHNIP LET ME TELL YOU THIS HILARIOUTH JOKE I JUTH *cough cough cough cough* HEARD
Mar 18 16:41:35 <parsnip>	wasamasa: has this problem already been factored as much as possible? like, the most complicated step should be from String to AST, right?
Mar 18 16:41:58 <parsnip>	keep that working, maybe tested, no?
Mar 18 16:42:07 <wasamasa>	sure, that works
Mar 18 16:42:22 <wasamasa>	the thing is just, you have to know how to do that
Mar 18 16:42:53 <python476>	parsnip: non linear response in anxious crowds
Mar 18 16:43:19 <parsnip>	that escalated quickly (too soon?)
Mar 18 16:44:34 <wasamasa>	quiliro: anyway, I went through github and found this: https://github.com/xuchunyang/elisp-demos/blob/master/elisp-demos.org#L6706
Mar 18 16:47:42 <python476>	pl
Mar 18 16:48:23 <wasamasa>	stupidly big file
Mar 18 16:48:39 <wasamasa>	it seems the library is used in more projects than expected
Mar 18 16:48:58 <shrysr>	i have just started https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/el-intro ..
Mar 18 16:50:05 <shrysr>	using nov.el :) ty wasamasa 
Mar 18 16:50:13 <wasamasa>	you're welcome
Mar 18 16:50:24 <wasamasa>	but if you're reading it in emacs, why not use info?
Mar 18 16:51:17 <shrysr>	info can read epub ?
Mar 18 16:51:42 <wasamasa>	no, the manual is originally provided as info file
Mar 18 16:51:44 <quiliro>	wasamasa: nice
Mar 18 16:51:46 <wasamasa>	and shipped with emacs
Mar 18 16:52:00 <wasamasa>	someone converted it to epub - for offline reading I suppose
Mar 18 16:52:04 <shrysr>	wait a sec. Is the book the same as the manual ?? 
Mar 18 16:52:05 <fsbot>	Highly likely
Mar 18 16:52:25 <shrysr>	lmao... okay. i need coffee. 
Mar 18 16:52:25 <wasamasa>	yes, same author and everything
Mar 18 16:54:42 <shrysr>	yea. it says so ... first line in the repo. i prob need cocaine
Mar 18 16:55:35 <npostavs>	shrysr: to be fair, looks like it only started saying that yesterday. https://gitlab.com/emacs-manuals/el-intro/-/commit/77a220b9d7a58b0d2da1b5231beb13fc31fb6c50
Mar 18 16:57:02 <npostavs>	And why are the commit messages after the first two just some random names?
Mar 18 17:00:53 <jmd>	What's the predicate to test whether a symbol has a definition as a variable?
Mar 18 17:01:11 <npostavs>	jmd: boundp
Mar 18 17:02:13 <quiliro>	Initial commit 2020-03-14
Mar 18 17:02:21 <thblt>	also useful is bound-and-true-p
Mar 18 17:03:48 <thblt>	(which is admittedly just a shorthand for (and (boundp 'var) 'var))
Mar 18 17:03:49 <quiliro>	,moon

Mar 19 13:53:35 <codingquark>	parsnip: ~3min
Mar 19 13:53:59 <codingquark>	This is actually the first time I'm syncing the account. It is a new one I got for $WORK
Mar 19 13:54:23 <codingquark>	Being a beta release, it probably has a lot of issues.
Mar 19 13:54:51 <parsnip>	seems fine. you could make it less frequent if you make it easier to selectively refresh boxes from mu4e. but then you have to watch out for weirdness, like if you move an email, you probably want to sync both the target and source box.
Mar 19 13:54:56 <codingquark>	For example: {"level":"error","msg":"cannot send response tag 18 'UID FETCH completed': write tcp 127.0.0.1:1143-\u003e127.0.0.1:34248: write: broken pipe","pkg":"server-imap","time":"2020-03-19T18:24:25+05:30"}
Mar 19 13:55:20 <parsnip>	generally, i mostly need my email refreshed when my phone buzzes, or when i just sent an email.
Mar 19 13:55:51 <parsnip>	so if my phone buzzes, i should have a key that syncs INBOX and reindexes
Mar 19 13:56:16 <parsnip>	i never really polished these, but that was the goal
Mar 19 13:56:17 <codingquark>	Nice idea since you rely on phone.
Mar 19 13:56:30 <parsnip>	your phone doesn't buzz when you get an email?
Mar 19 13:56:41 <codingquark>	I keep it away when I'm working.
Mar 19 13:57:53 <codingquark>	For work, things are much more streamlined now: stuff happens on Basecamp and only some emails.
Mar 19 13:58:24 <codingquark>	Some people still message on Slack, but since I do not check it often, they are tuning to expect that.
Mar 19 14:00:22 <codingquark>	After moving to Basecamp, shit got real nice and clean. Since I and others enjoy writing lengthy, thoughtful things over sync comm, it allows people to be more "calm".
Mar 19 14:00:38 <codingquark>	For some this is not so intuitive yet. But I'll help them see.

Mar 19 14:13:41 <parsnip>	video calls are so bougie
Mar 19 14:13:50 <codingquark>	PITA
Mar 19 14:17:37 <parsnip>	yeah, i find it very tedious to get the green screen setup, then set an indian jones scene as the background
Mar 19 14:18:05 <parsnip>	actually, i guess some micorosoft ad shows that feature
Mar 19 14:18:58 <codingquark>	I just don't want to talk on calls.
Mar 19 14:19:21 <parsnip>	yeah in today's world phone calls are sort of the last option
Mar 19 14:19:31 <parsnip>	"why are you calling me?"
Mar 19 14:19:37 <codingquark>	Video or speech. Daily meetings are waste of time, and so is discussing technical stuff.
Mar 19 14:19:59 <parsnip>	ah, getting into the weeds
Mar 19 14:20:15 <codingquark>	Things are forgotten, and many times simply lost. More problems when new persons want to join in.
Mar 19 14:20:30 <telmich>	good day! I have a function `(defun vcs-filename (&optional arg) (concat "~/vcs/notes/" (format-time-string "%Y") "-" arg system-name ".org"))` and I am trying to use it's return value in another function like this:
Mar 19 14:20:31 <telmich>	`(setq org-capture-templates '(("t" "todo" entry (file+headline (vcs-filename "todo-") "Tasks") "* TODO [#B] %?\nSCHEDULED: %(org-insert-time-stamp (org-read-date nil t \"+0d\"))\n%a\n")))` 
Mar 19 14:20:43 <parsnip>	*its
Mar 19 14:21:00 <telmich>	However it seems that `(vcs-filename "todo-")` returns nil - is there something I am doing conceptually wrong?
Mar 19 14:21:18 <telmich>	(even though it doesn't, if I call it in the scratch buffer)
Mar 19 14:43:17 <Bounga>	Hi, is there a way to scroll in a child frame using keyboard?
Mar 19 14:51:53 <loskutak>	I have a buffer with xyzvar=value lines. What is the best way to parse this into some better data structure (plist?)?
Mar 19 14:52:31 <tromey>	alists are more normal, I guess I'd probably just do it with a loop and a regexp

Mar 19 15:31:11 <jmd>	The compiler I'm using is dumping VT100 sequences (or something) into the *compilation* buffer which it can't handle nicely.  Is there a workaround for this?
Mar 19 15:31:30 <mplsCorwin>	loskutak: FWIW, I'd use mapcan or something with split-string to make a plist
Mar 19 15:32:23 <thblt>	jmd: polite compilers have a --no-color mode
Mar 19 15:32:47 <jmd>	thblt: Sure.  But I don't think this one is very polite :(
Mar 19 15:33:04 <Naptra>	Hello, how to check if I have cider-mode enabled in a buffer?
Mar 19 15:34:00 <mplsCorwin>	Naptra: I think you can get the list of enabled major mode and minor modes from C-h m
Mar 19 15:34:46 <thblt>	jmd: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24698/ansi-escape-sequences-in-compilation-mode the solution seems to add a process filter to remove the sequences. But who’s that rude compiler?
Mar 19 15:40:26 <jmd>	thblt: It's some ancient thing from the 1990s (yeah I know!)
Mar 19 15:43:05 <thblt>	jmd: I’de have expected those to be the polite ones.  What are the term sequences for, progress bars? 
Mar 19 15:43:48 <ldlework>	Does anyone know how to insert a row into a table with EmacSQL, where the :primary-key is :autoincrement?
Mar 19 15:43:55 <jmd>	I think they are indeed colours.
Mar 19 15:43:58 <ldlework>	It seems to want values...

Mar 19 16:15:02 <roadie>	in paths one can tab to the / ...
Mar 19 16:17:46 <jmd>	xristos: It's not clear from the comments how to use it in conjunction with compilation-mode
Mar 19 16:18:01 <jmd>	xterm-color
Mar 19 16:19:21 <jmd>	xterm-color-colorize-buffer seems to get rid of the escape sequences ok, but I have to call it every time something gets written to the buffer.
Mar 19 16:19:33 <jmd>	Maybe I need to add it to a hook.
Mar 19 16:20:19 <xristos>	did you read the documentation?
Mar 19 16:20:39 <jmd>	Not every word.
Mar 19 16:20:48 <jmd>	But yes I did read it.
Mar 19 16:20:56 <xristos>	did you miss this: For standalone compilation buffers use the following configuration
Mar 19 16:21:24 <jmd>	Yeah.  I'm not sure what it means by a standalone compilation buffer.
Mar 19 16:21:31 <jmd>	Aren't they all standalone?
Mar 19 16:21:54 <xristos>	no, there is compilation-shell-minor-mode as i previously mentioned
Mar 19 16:21:55 <jmd>	And that sentence is right under the bit about shell-minor mode
Mar 19 16:22:22 <jmd>	So from what you previously said I infered that it was not relevant.
Mar 19 16:22:46 <xristos>	try it, lmk if it works
Mar 19 16:23:40 <jmd>	Are you the author?
Mar 19 16:23:47 <xristos>	nod

Mar 19 16:42:58 <parsnip>	do people in other countries struggle when using a 0.00 format of currency?
Mar 19 16:43:21 <parsnip>	i mean, they would encounter it in programming anyways
Mar 19 16:44:10 <parsnip>	since most software i think comes out of us and china, so `0,000.00` and `0 000.00`, respectively.
Mar 19 16:44:27 <JordiGH>	meme.el requires imgur. Any idea where that could be found?
Mar 19 16:45:00 <jmd>	parsnip: The convention in India is most interesting.
Mar 19 16:45:04 <parsnip>	JordiGH: on the dork web
Mar 19 16:45:14 <parsnip>	00,00,000.00
Mar 19 16:45:44 <parsnip>	i've seen that... my app hasn't really thought about group separators yet
Mar 19 16:46:05 <parsnip>	i'm just trying to get decimal separators, because damnit, someone requested zero padding early on.
Mar 19 16:46:12 <JordiGH>	Aha: https://github.com/larsmagne/imgur.el
Mar 19 16:46:25 <parsnip>	i was sure you were telling a joke
Mar 19 16:46:31 <grym>	parsnip: i made a really derpy CSV export bug once that taught me to normalise separators 
Mar 19 16:46:34 <parsnip>	i can't tell when you're serious
Mar 19 16:46:53 <JordiGH>	The joke isn't told yet. That's what I need meme.el and imgur.el for
Mar 19 16:46:56 <grym>	everything worked fine until the danish guy used my modeling code and got twice as many columns in his CSV files than any other user
Mar 19 16:47:02 <parsnip>	grym: yeah, unfortunately ledger/hledger users have been spoiled
Mar 19 16:47:32 <parsnip>	i thought you were making a joke that we need meme.el, and that imgur would have to be a prerequisite
Mar 19 16:47:40 <grym>	parsnip: now i do whatever i have to to beat text numeric output into not using system encoding or localisations 
Mar 19 16:47:42 <parsnip>	TWO JOKES, even
Mar 19 16:48:35 <parsnip>	grym: yes, users are about to be upset, because i'm removing the numberLocale thing from the settings view. but i don't want to piss them off too bad, so they'll have to discover i'll parse the first commodity directive i find.
Mar 19 16:49:01 <parsnip>	so now the app will default to "0.00 XXX"
Mar 19 16:49:23 <parsnip>	and they'll have to go through jumps and loops to change it.
Mar 19 16:49:40 <JordiGH>	parsnip: the joke is serious: https://github.com/larsmagne/meme
Mar 19 16:49:46 <JordiGH>	memegenerator is down, so I need an alternative.
Mar 19 16:50:07 <parsnip>	if you think they won't whine, people are already like, "we need little-endian dates"
Mar 19 16:50:31 <parsnip>	jokes can't be serious
Mar 19 16:50:35 <JordiGH>	Dammit, it's buggy.
Mar 19 16:50:59 *	parsnip stubbornly spells it "damnit"
Mar 19 16:51:57 <parsnip>	hmm, "damnit" is claimed to be a southern US spelling
Mar 19 16:52:50 <parsnip>	> Wafflehouse, 'Damnit' is the correct spelling and has been for a long, long time. (if you put 'damn' and 'it' together you don't get 'idontknowhowtospell' you get 'damnit.' I'm trying to figure out where this change originated, but be assured that your statement is so far from correct that you can't see it from this side of the sun. It is neither an incorrect contraction or common misspelling (the spelling 'dammit' is

Mar 19 16:54:06 <mplsCorwin>	LUL
Mar 19 16:55:02 <parsnip>	i officially take issue with your spelling of damnit
Mar 19 16:56:03 <jmd>	xristos: Well it seems to be effective in turning the escape codes into whitespace, which is an improvement, but not what I expected.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <wgreenhouse>	jmd: late to the party but does messing with ,,dv ansi-color-for-comint-mode,, affect your case?
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	Determines what to do with comint output.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If nil, do nothing.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If the symbol ‘filter’, then filter all SGR control sequences.
Mar 19 16:57:33 <fsbot>	If anything else (such as t), then translate SGR control sequences ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

Mar 19 17:02:19 <bpalmer>	that's like the opposite of the great universe of taste I was leading you towards!

Mar 19 17:05:08 <bpalmer>	wgreenhouse: your $work is still open?
Mar 19 17:06:16 <defanor>	is there a known fix for the shell.el situation when comint-history-isearch-backward-regexp is active and new process output appears, leading to the search string being weirdly mixed with that output?
Mar 19 17:06:27 <wgreenhouse>	bpalmer: yeah--we're a legal aid office--bad shit is still happening to our clients so we're still here, about 50% work from home so far
Mar 19 17:06:41 <parsnip>	rudybot: is this the coreal space?
Mar 19 17:06:52 <rudybot>	parsnip: is there a way I can do this the way I want, C-space, up up up up up up up up up ( however many times ), C-space, C-k, C-o, C-y
Mar 19 17:07:50 <bpalmer>	defanor: I haven't run into that, I don't think.
Mar 19 17:08:02 <bpalmer>	oh, so you've previuosly put a process in background mode?
Mar 19 17:08:14 <xristos>	jmd: open up xterm-colortest (in xterm-color/tests/) in Emacs, then do M-x compile and input "perl xterm-colortest -w" instead of make ..
Mar 19 17:08:20 <xristos>	is the output in color?
Mar 19 17:09:18 <jmd>	I don't have perl on this machine.
Mar 19 17:09:54 <jmd>	M-x xterm-color-test works nicely though.
Mar 19 17:10:10 <xristos>	that doesn't exercise compilation-mode
Mar 19 17:11:24 <jmd>	I have a suspicion that some of the sequences I'm getting are not colours.  they might be cursor moves etc.
Mar 19 17:11:32 <xristos>	try
Mar 19 17:11:42 <xristos>	M-x compile in any buffer, and input printf "\x1b[0;1;3;4;35;51mThis is only a test\x1b[0m"
Mar 19 17:11:59 <defanor>	bpalmer: happens here quite reliably, at least with regular telnet(1). it's in foreground, though my emacs and shell.el may be a bit old
Mar 19 17:12:16 <jmd>	All those \x1b stuff are litereral?
Mar 19 17:12:28 <xristos>	yes you can copy paste it
Mar 19 17:13:15 <defanor>	hrm, wasn't able to reproduce it with just `sleep` and `echo`. maybe should tweak telnet's buffering or something
Mar 19 17:13:46 <defanor>	though i'm even not sure why that happens, but i guess it could be that comint handles line-buffered output well
Mar 19 17:14:14 <defanor>	oh, but i need it to be byte/character-buffered
Mar 19 17:15:16 <jmd>	xristos: Can you past that again for me?
Mar 19 17:15:48 <xristos>	jmd: M-x compile then input: printf "\x1b[0;1;3;4;35;51mThis is only a test\x1b[0m"
Mar 19 17:17:19 <jmd>	xristos: The text showed up pink and underlined.
Mar 19 17:17:26 <jmd>	and in a box.
Mar 19 17:18:07 <xristos>	ok then I guess your compiler doesn't produce SGR sequences
Mar 19 17:18:35 <jmd>	That is quite possible.
Mar 19 17:18:51 <xristos>	you can set xterm-color-debug to T, run it and look in *Messages* for not implemented messages
Mar 19 17:18:57 <xristos>	to verify that's the case
Mar 19 17:21:37 <jmd>	xristos: Yep.  There are quite a lot of them.
Mar 19 17:21:57 <xristos>	can you mail the output to me? xristos (at) sdf.org
Mar 19 17:22:14 <xristos>	(the xterm-color: output in *Messages*)
Mar 19 17:22:31 <jmd>	ok
Mar 19 17:23:32 <xristos>	also if you do C-h v process-connection-type what is the value?
Mar 19 17:23:52 <xristos>	and the same for compilation-environment
Mar 19 17:27:36 <yeti>	C-x C-c

Mar 19 17:36:12 *	JordiGH files an issue: https://github.com/larsmagne/meme/issues/5
Mar 19 17:36:23 <jmd>	compilation-environment is ("TERM=xterm-256color")
Mar 19 17:36:40 <xristos>	ok
Mar 19 17:36:55 <jmd>	(I sent that mail)
Mar 19 17:38:18 <rdbeni0>	which is best TAGs system for emacs? ctags, etags? exuberant ctags ? any recommendations
Mar 19 17:38:30 *	cvandusen waits for the "Kerning is catastrophic" meta-meme
Mar 19 17:38:59 <xristos>	rdbeni0: ggtags for me
Mar 19 17:39:43 <tromey>	I switched to ggtags as well.  it's nicer than the others since it auto-updates, but it is still not superb
Mar 19 17:40:30 <rdbeni0>	10 points for Gryffindor... sorry, 2 points for ggtags. Any other competitor ? what about ctags
Mar 19 17:41:11 <cvandusen>	lsp for me 
Mar 19 17:41:16 <tromey>	ctags is just etags with a different (I guess worse) file format
Mar 19 17:41:35 <tromey>	lsp is a good choice if you can use it
Mar 19 17:42:13 <xristos>	you can compile global with ctags support
Mar 19 17:42:20 <xristos>	that way it can use it for languages it doesn't support
Mar 19 17:42:25 <xristos>	i never bothered tho
Mar 19 17:44:04 <rdbeni0>	https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode#installation so this is the latest lsp and it could be used instead of TAGs system, i am correct?
Mar 19 17:44:36 <xristos>	i would set up a solid tag system first, and then maybe bother with lsp
Mar 19 17:44:43 <xristos>	you can always rely on tags
Mar 19 17:44:52 <xristos>	lsp is questionable
Mar 19 17:48:19 <rdbeni0>	so GNU Global is TAG system, ggtags is mode for it. I am going google to table comparison between TAG systems, we will see
Mar 19 17:59:18 <loskutak>	I have tried to set up tags a few times, but there are so many options... superconfusing. etags ctags exuberant global. I just use dumbjump and while it is annoying from time to time, it is reasonably usable.
Mar 19 18:00:50 <jmd>	What's so confusing about just running "etags *.[ch]" ?
Mar 19 18:01:13 <mplsCorwin>	I can't even remember what I'm using.  I do recall it was a little fussy setting up on win10.  I think I needed msys32 and some stuff.  It's worked great for several upgrades to the point I haven't thought about it for some time.
Mar 19 18:01:26 <mplsCorwin>	it's probably etags
Mar 19 18:03:06 <xristos>	jmd: i went through the output and none of these are colors, mostly cursor placement, so it's to be expected they'll get filtered out
Mar 19 18:03:36 <jmd>	xristos: I suspected as much.
Mar 19 18:03:38 <MoziM>	ugh... the micro center better not be closed
Mar 19 18:04:12 <jmd>	The problem is, after filtering there are large amounts of vertical whitespace.
Mar 19 18:05:10 <mplsCorwin>	There's literally no tagging configuration I can find anywhere in my init scripts.  Whatever I did I think it was just drop an .exe in the right place and then I'm getting *something* OOB.  Maybe treemacs is doing the heavy lifting.
Mar 19 18:06:18 <mplsCorwin>	xristos: jmd: you guys have the foor.  sorry about the natter.
Mar 19 18:07:15 <thblt>	Hey this thing is starting to look like a keyboard https://i.imgur.com/IQo6V60.png
Mar 19 18:09:27 <cvandusen>	Either that or stadium seating.
Mar 19 18:09:41 <thblt>	The difference is in the dimensions.
Mar 19 18:10:01 <thblt>	(to be clear it’s the left half of a split keyboard)
Mar 19 18:13:50 <technomancy>	thblt: is this based on the dactyl?
Mar 19 18:14:37 <thblt>	technomancy: Loosely. It’s the same basic idea, but it’s laser-cut sheet metal instead of 3D printing.
Mar 19 18:15:24 <thblt>	(Or maybe laser-cut plastic)
Mar 19 18:15:25 <technomancy>	awesome. how powerful of a laser do you need to cut that metal? how thick is it?
Mar 19 18:15:35 <technomancy>	yeah laser-cut acrylic is easy peasy
Mar 19 18:16:02 <technomancy>	but I've only done very simple designs that are actually 3D rather than stacked layers
Mar 19 18:16:26 <technomancy>	that is a ridiculously large thumb cluster, lol
Mar 19 18:16:30 <thblt>	technomancy: 1.5mm, I have no idea about the laser power, but it’s a lot more than acrylic. 
Mar 19 18:17:04 <thblt>	I’m not too happy with it right now, but thumbs can move so I’m giving them keys to move on :)
Mar 19 18:17:32 <technomancy>	hitting the 5th key out on a thumb cluster is an uncomfortable stretch; hitting the sixth is just not a thing
Mar 19 18:17:43 <zellio>	you need 100s of watts to cut meta
Mar 19 18:18:03 <jmd>	Typically one cannot cut metal with a laser.
Mar 19 18:18:05 <wgreenhouse>	metawatts
Mar 19 18:18:18 <zellio>	but yeah, it's also reflective which means you can't really do much
Mar 19 18:18:31 <jmd>	The beam will simply bounce off into your face and blind you.
Mar 19 18:18:32 <zellio>	if you want to etch on meta there are ways to sortof go about doing it
Mar 19 18:18:36 <zellio>	*metal
Mar 19 18:20:46 <jmd>	The 130 W laser I'm working on costs > $30,000 just for the pump.  I dunno if Megawatt lasers exist outside of the military.
Mar 19 18:22:55 <grym>	jmd: but, do you have a phase conjugate tracking mirror 
Mar 19 18:23:39 <jmd>	... and even the best lasers have an efficiency of only around 10% so a MW laser would need a large power supply.
Mar 19 18:23:52 <jmd>	grym: No.
Mar 19 18:25:22 <fledermaus>	Do not stare into laser with remaining eye.
Mar 19 18:26:19 <fledermaus>	Unrelated: don't try to line up a diffraction grating by eye when you're half asleep in a 9am physics practical.
Mar 19 18:27:34 <grym>	jmd: oh good i won't have to buy up all that popcorn 
Mar 19 18:30:05 <jmd>	I think metal cutting is often done today using high  pressure water jets.
Mar 19 18:31:01 <technomancy>	yeah, water jets are more common when working with metal
Mar 19 18:31:05 <technomancy>	still crazy expensive tho
Mar 19 18:36:09 <Huck777>	hi, how can I set emacs, that after a 'cd' it stays there as a project folder? because when I open a file in 'templates/file.html' it stays in templates/ instead of being in the project folder. Or is my workflow wrong with helm-find-files?
Mar 19 18:38:27 <moowhool>	Hello everyone. Is there a way to get better qualit png in docview ?
Mar 19 18:39:07 <Ronis_BR>	Hi guys! I am having problems when displaying a file with a lot of numbers and using the `highlight-numbers-mode`. The performance is very, very bad. However, if I start emacs in text mode (`emacs -nw`), then it is fine.
Mar 19 18:39:17 <Ronis_BR>	Is there anything I can do to improve this in GUI?
Mar 19 18:41:50 <Amy1>	hello
Mar 19 18:42:00 <bpalmer>	Huck777: by default, default-directory after you open a file will be the directory containing that file. If you want to change that, you probably want a function in find-file-hook that resets default-directory
Mar 19 18:42:20 <Huck777>	bpalmer, ok - thank you
Mar 19 18:42:44 <Amy1>	(setq aa 2)
Mar 19 18:42:46 <Amy1>	(debug-on-variable-change aa)
Mar 19 18:43:06 <Amy1>	why not working?
Mar 19 18:43:28 <Amy1>	Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function debug-on-variable-change)
Mar 19 18:43:30 <Amy1>	  (debug-on-variable-change aa)
Mar 19 18:43:32 <bpalmer>	you probably need to quote the variable name in the call to debug-on-variable-change. Try (debug-on-variable-change 'aa)
Mar 19 18:43:32 <Amy1>	  eval((debug-on-variable-change aa) nil)
Mar 19 18:43:44 <grym>	water jets are so cool 
Mar 19 18:43:45 <grym>	har har

Mar 19 18:44:24 <Amy1>	grym: the same error
Mar 19 18:44:52 <Amy1>	bpalmer: I am using Emacs 25.3
Mar 19 18:45:27 <bpalmer>	Amy1: I believe that API was added in 26
Mar 19 18:45:50 <fledermaus>	it's not in 25
Mar 19 18:47:54 <Amy1>	bpalmer: yeah,you are right
Mar 19 18:56:08 <Amy1>	(setq bb 1)
Mar 19 18:56:10 <Amy1>	(setq bb 2)
Mar 19 18:56:12 <Amy1>	(add-variable-watcher 'bb (lambda () (print "hello")))
Mar 19 18:56:14 <Amy1>	(setq bb 3)
Mar 19 18:56:20 <Amy1>	why this not work?
Mar 19 18:57:06 <npostavs>	because you're not using Emacs 26?  (also, the lambda should accept some arguments)
Mar 19 19:02:21 <Amy1>	I am using 26.
Mar 19 19:02:40 <Amy1>	npostavs: could you show me the right code of add-variable-watcher?
Mar 19 19:08:21 <bpalmer>	Amy1: C-h f add-variable-watcher RET describes what parameters the function you provide needs to handle (it will have 4 arguments)
Mar 19 19:12:46 <bpalmer>	rudybot: the only thing to watch is a watch itself.
Mar 19 19:13:14 <rudybot>	bpalmer: nah, I won't watch it. it's action, violent etc., taking itself serious, trying to be popular, kinda not my thing, as an anime hipster
Mar 19 19:13:57 <oni-on-ion>	heh
Mar 19 19:17:43 <Amy1>	I still can't use this function.
Mar 19 19:17:56 <Amy1>	who can give me an example of add-variable-watcher

Mar 20 10:33:27 <ldlework>	ooooo
Mar 20 10:33:45 <ldlework>	been using emacs all these years but it justed occured to me that markers move as the buffer is edited
Mar 20 10:45:15 <flux1>	related to that: is there a way to move GDB breakpoints when you edit the buffer? that would be quite nice.
Mar 20 10:45:42 <flux1>	(last time I looked into it it seems GDB doesn't actually give a way to move a breakpoint, you need to delete and add :/)
Mar 20 11:04:33 <ldlework>	How do I get messages to stop getting cut off with ...

Mar 20 11:28:17 <rdbeni0>	i am going to start use & configure lsp-mode today
Mar 20 11:59:11 <wgreenhouse>	ldlework: not sure in what context this is happening but you could try setting or let-binding ,,dv print-length,, to nil
Mar 20 11:59:11 <fsbot>	Maximum length of list to print before abbreviating.
Mar 20 11:59:11 <fsbot>	A value of nil means no limit.  See also ‘eval-expression-print-length’.

Mar 20 15:48:39 <parsnip>	i think in some languages, != is replaced with =/=
Mar 20 15:48:52 <thblt>	It doesn’t have finer-grained input events than "pressed", and ctrl never gets "pressed" since it’s a modifier.
Mar 20 15:48:56 <yeti>	that's mor a strike thru
Mar 20 15:48:58 <thblt>	parsnip: Haskell uses /=

Mar 20 16:01:46 <thblt>	I don’t think you can create a non-ascii prefix unary operator in Haskell.
Mar 20 16:02:26 <thblt>	Unary - is a compiler trick IIRC 
Mar 20 16:03:17 <thblt>	Yes, -3 expands to (negate 3) at desugaring phase.

Mar 20 16:31:37 <thblt>	Ronis_BR: But your font shouldn’t affect performance. 
Mar 20 16:31:52 <thblt>	Menlo is Apple’s equivalent
Mar 20 16:31:59 <Ronis_BR>	thblt: it affects and it is very apparent
Mar 20 16:32:00 <rdbeni0>	i am using:   (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
Mar 20 16:33:37 <mplsCorwin>	Could font affect performance if the selected font is missing a bunch of unicode chars, languages etc, and this causes a bunch of glyph hunting?

Apr 02 09:56:48 <aidalgol>	I spelt it wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi
Apr 02 09:57:18 <aidalgol>	I don't think I've had that particular type of dumpling in a looooong time, if ever.
Apr 02 09:57:41 <aidalgol>	But I've had similar more recently
Apr 02 09:57:54 <twb>	aidalgol: I made pav bhaji recently
Apr 02 09:58:24 <twb>	I haven't made steamed bread in a LONG time
Apr 02 10:01:43 <aidalgol>	never had that one
Apr 02 10:08:16 <shrysr>	 well the bread doesnt ~have to be steamed for pav bhaji. cd be toasted with butter .. crunchy etc.
Apr 02 10:08:37 <andinus>	morning 0/
Apr 02 10:08:54 <ldlework>	god bless dumplings
Apr 02 10:09:05 <twb>	shrysr: yeah I was going back to bao
Apr 02 10:09:32 <twb>	shrysr: in china bread is steamed by default
Apr 02 10:09:40 <twb>	shrysr: and sometimes they put stuff inside
Apr 02 10:10:24 <shrysr>	they prolly do a lotta things.
Apr 02 10:11:10 <shrysr>	pav bhaji is indian afaik tho 
Apr 02 10:13:03 <shrysr>	thblt: howddya mean multiplexed reveal.js ?
Apr 02 10:16:39 <codingquark>	So now I need to upgrade OpenWRT
Apr 02 10:16:50 <codingquark>	It got fucked, apparently (not my specific router)
Apr 02 10:17:21 <twb>	codingquark: if it was pre-LEDE reunion, it's worth it
Apr 02 10:19:03 <codingquark>	twb: it's running 18.6 dude. But even that is compromised.
Apr 02 10:19:03 <codingquark>	twb: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/openwrt-is-vulnerable-to-attacks-that-execute-malicious-code/
Apr 02 10:19:04 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/nA7CDlHtY2
Apr 02 10:20:12 <Viking667>	quick question - once I've started emacs in daemon mode, how do I shut that down? (Yeah, I'm new to emacs, I normally run ${that_other_editor}
Apr 02 10:21:10 <shrysr>	Viking667: one way is ps aux |grep emacs  and then kill <pid>. ANother is start the emacsclient and M-x kill-emacs
Apr 02 10:22:09 <twb>	18.06 was first post-reunion release
Apr 02 10:22:11 <twb>	I knew it was close
Apr 02 10:22:31 <twb>	codingquark: OK so it's CVE 2020-7982
Apr 02 10:22:47 <twb>	https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-7982
Apr 02 10:23:22 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, that one.
Apr 02 10:23:22 <twb>	codingquark: so the badness is in opkg checksum validation, so it will trigger iff you install a packag?
Apr 02 10:24:24 <Viking667>	hm, so both the methods I thought of then. Okay, so I can't actually shut down the server from an emacsclient command?
Apr 02 10:25:07 <Viking667>	Could I use this:  emacsclient -e "M-x kill-emacs"   ?
Apr 02 10:25:23 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, looks like the MITM can downgrade https connection and feed you bad packages.
Apr 02 10:25:24 <codingquark>	By adding some nullbytes or zeros or something to keep the package _size_ the same.
Apr 02 10:25:32 <twb>	codingquark: it's not HTTPS at all
Apr 02 10:26:00 <codingquark>	twb: even if it is, can be downgraded in cases.
Apr 02 10:26:17 <twb>	codingquark: basically it's that you hijack DNS and serve out a package index that has
Apr 02 10:26:24 <twb>	"SHA256Sum:  deadbeef"
Apr 02 10:26:26 <twb>	instead of
Apr 02 10:26:27 <twb>	"SHA256Sum: deadbeef"
Apr 02 10:26:43 <twb>	It's not a sum collision or anything, just shitty string parsing code in C
Apr 02 10:27:56 <codingquark>	Ah, I see!
Apr 02 10:28:02 *	Viking667 gives up and goes with M-x kill-emacs
Apr 02 10:28:08 <twb>	The padding it talks about is simply because the "File-Size: 1234b" type header is not vulnerable and is still validated
Apr 02 10:28:09 <Viking667>	Okay, thanks for your help.
Apr 02 10:28:22 <fledermaus>	https://mstdn.io/@sohkamyung/103927578883655708
Apr 02 10:28:23 <codingquark>	twb: yeah, that I gathered.
Apr 02 10:28:29 <twb>	It's standard to validate BOTH the sum and the size, to prevent padding attacks
Apr 02 10:29:04 <codingquark>	I mean it better be!
Apr 02 10:30:30 <twb>	codingquark: of course if you're clever you include the file size in the thing being summed
Apr 02 10:30:47 <twb>	codingquark: so that it's harder to fuck with
Apr 02 10:31:01 <twb>	codingquark: I don't remember the exact right way to do it, but e.g. Schneier's textbooks will tell you
Apr 02 10:31:52 <codingquark>	I got the book, I'll check it out, thanks man!
Apr 02 10:36:26 <codingquark>	wasamasa: urine therapy lol
Apr 02 10:36:35 <wasamasa>	yes, my grandpa did it
Apr 02 10:36:46 <wasamasa>	the whole place was filled with pee jars
Apr 02 10:36:53 <wasamasa>	sometimes they had lemon slices in them
Apr 02 10:37:24 <codingquark>	The analogy you drew is amazing.
Apr 02 10:37:53 <wasamasa>	my father did kvass occasionally and his stuff was dark brown
Apr 02 10:38:13 <wasamasa>	but then it also had a strong smell
Apr 02 10:40:38 <aidalgol>	aaaaaaand the TMI award of the year goes to...
Apr 02 10:40:57 <wasamasa>	I have an even worse story, just for you
Apr 02 10:41:34 <wasamasa>	at some point me and my mother had to live at the grandparents for a while and grandpa ran out of jars to fill
Apr 02 10:41:50 <wasamasa>	so he took a set of cups from my mother
Apr 02 10:42:34 <wasamasa>	when she discovered that, she took a cardboard box, filled it with the cups and put them outside on the street as a giveaway
Apr 02 10:42:35 <thblt>	shrysr: there's a built-in reveal plugin called multiplex, where a master presentation drives any number of slaves.  In practice, you give an URL to the students, and you scroll the slides for them while you talk.  
Apr 02 10:42:54 <wasamasa>	five minutes later the box was gone and to this day we laugh at the misfortune of whoever picked it up
Apr 02 10:44:54 <thblt>	maybe that person uses them for English tea, over which piss with a lemon slice is a net improvement.
Apr 02 10:45:13 <wasamasa>	:D
Apr 02 10:45:39 <aidalgol>	what did you label it as?
Apr 02 10:45:55 <wasamasa>	"Zu verschenken"
Apr 02 10:46:55 <wasamasa>	though, I'm not sure there was even a label on the box
Apr 02 10:47:15 <aidalgol>	You're all a bunch of evil bastards.  I'm going to bed.
Apr 02 10:49:45 <codingquark>	I don't know why I got disconnected, very sad.
Apr 02 10:50:38 <codingquark>	What function to use to quickly alternate between two buffers (something like "switch to the other buffer that I just switched from")
Apr 02 10:53:46 <codingquark>	Also, I've started using org-brain with a setup I deemed appropriate.
Apr 02 10:53:56 <kensanata>	codingquark: I have no idea but I know that C-x b runs ivy-switch-buffer on my system.
Apr 02 10:53:57 <codingquark>	Side effect is that I don't know where to jot down quick one-liners
Apr 02 10:54:34 <codingquark>	kensanata: that gives a list of recently opened buffers, right?
Apr 02 10:54:36 <kensanata>	codingquark: I have a ~/NOTES.org for all the messy stuff I can't file
Apr 02 10:55:04 <shrysr>	ty thblt thats interesting to know.
Apr 02 10:55:06 <codingquark>	kensanata: amazing, that is exactly what I have done! I considered it a "temporary measure" though.
Apr 02 10:55:15 <kensanata>	codingquark: it gives me completing of all the buffers and I guess the last one is highlighted by default so RET will do it.
Apr 02 10:55:42 <codingquark>	kensanata: yeah. What I want is a single function so that I can alternate between two buffers.
Apr 02 10:56:09 <kensanata>	More like a "permanent measure" as I hardly ever post-process it; eventually it's simply archived and I never look at the archive.
Apr 02 10:56:16 <codingquark>	Hmm, there is mode-line-other-buffer
Apr 02 10:57:16 <kensanata>	I don't understand what buffer-name-history contains.
Apr 02 10:58:43 <kensanata>	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SwitchingBuffers#toc5
Apr 02 10:59:51 <shrysr>	org-brain is great..it changed the way i learn stuff, but imo needs to be combined with something like org-journal or rough notes system. I use a modified version of scimax-journal. 
Apr 02 11:00:08 <codingquark>	kensanata: thanks!
Apr 02 11:00:36 <codingquark>	I've now bound it under exwm-input-set-key.
Apr 02 11:02:28 <jimmyjimjim>	hi all. Has anyone got magit/forge working with gitlab?  The docs get a little vague on this, but I think I've created the token, placed it in the right place (~/.authinfo). But Whenever I try to make use of forge, I get told that there is no digehode^forge token. Based on my google search, nobody else has a problem with this, or nobody out there is using gitlab and forge.
Apr 02 11:07:12 <benny>	jimmyjimjim: I just tried and I get cl-no-applicable-method: No applicable method: forge-get-repository, [....]
Apr 02 11:09:15 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Oh, wow. That sounds worse than my own issue ;)
Apr 02 11:09:50 <benny>	your issue sounds like the syntax for .authinfo isn't what forge expects
Apr 02 11:10:26 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: try evaluating (require 'forge). I don't know if magit drops the options for it forge isn;t loaded
Apr 02 11:10:58 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: that's what I thought, but I can't see an issue. I got forge to generate a token automatically for github and it matches my format
Apr 02 11:11:21 <benny>	it looks like forge is doing stuff, it's definitely using emacsql which magit (I think) doesn't do
Apr 02 11:11:36 <benny>	my authinfo: machine gitlab.com/api/v4 login bennya^forge password xxxx
Apr 02 11:11:42 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Or does it... whitespace-mode suggests the auto-generated one is tab delimited
Apr 02 11:12:31 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: Nope. not that

Apr 02 11:12:52 <jimmyjimjim>	Mine is: machine gitlab.com/api/v4 login digehode^forge TOKENHERE
Apr 02 11:13:36 <thblt>	should the machine id takes a path component? 
Apr 02 11:14:11 <benny>	that looks wronger than what I have jimmyjimjim :P
Apr 02 11:14:11 <jimmyjimjim>	I'll try without. The few examples I found had it like that, but then they didn't seem towork for people either...
Apr 02 11:15:29 <benny>	I can't play around with my system at the moment, because it's right now at 21GB out of 16GB memory usage and not responsive ;-)
Apr 02 11:16:23 <jimmyjimjim>	benny: No worries. I think you might have spotted the problem :/
Apr 02 11:17:22 <jimmyjimjim>	FFS. I need to sleep. Sorry, I just used you to spot the typo in my file. I was convinced I had no mistakes and only seeing yours and comparing made me realise I missed the "password" keyword
Apr 02 11:18:05 <benny>	we've all been there :P
Apr 02 11:18:11 <benny>	good night
Apr 02 11:18:17 <jimmyjimjim>	Thanks :)
Apr 02 11:18:29 <benny>	even though my system is unresponsive I'm still flashed by the magit that is zram
Apr 02 11:18:34 <benny>	magic*
Apr 02 11:19:16 <benny>	I'm now at 24GB out of 16GB memory without using a disk backed swap
Apr 02 11:22:20 <thblt>	My RAM management solution is called Dell commercial practices, where when I bought my XPS 15, 32GB was cheaper than 16.
Apr 02 11:23:58 <benny>	unlucky for me I'm a thinkpad superfan and I live in Europe, so there nothing is cheap ;-)
Apr 02 11:27:07 <thblt>	My next laptop will be a reconditioned thinkpad I think.  I don't need the beefy laptop, I'd rather have a small ultraportable laptop and a beefy desktop.
Apr 02 11:27:50 <thblt>	Or even maybe a Surface tablet with a good external keyb
Apr 02 11:33:48 <benny>	keyboard is most important for me and then display, but I'm not a desktop kind of guy
Apr 02 11:59:59 <quiliro>	Hello
Apr 02 12:00:04 <quiliro>	Saluton!

Apr 02 13:46:56 <wasamasa>	apparently you can make kvass without yeast
Apr 02 13:47:09 <wasamasa>	just use some sauerkraut juice and wait a bit longer
Apr 02 13:50:56 <davemq>	I've made it with yeast, but using sauerkraut juice seems reasonable. Lacto fermentation vs. yeast fermentation
Apr 02 13:54:38 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: did you start the experiment?
Apr 02 13:55:16 <wgreenhouse>	most interesting aspect for us was finding the tiny temperature gradient within the house
Apr 02 13:55:20 <hodapp>	I thought kvass was lactobacillus fermentation, not yeast
Apr 02 13:55:26 <wgreenhouse>	warm spots where these fermentation projects go a little faster
Apr 02 13:55:44 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: the symbol kvass exists in multiple namespaces :)
Apr 02 13:56:02 <wgreenhouse>	there is bread kvass, which is yeast fermented, and there's e.g. beet kvass which is lactofermented veggie juice
Apr 02 13:56:11 <hodapp>	hmmm
Apr 02 13:56:22 <wgreenhouse>	bread kvass is like a near beer, basically
Apr 02 13:56:26 <wgreenhouse>	usually made from stale rye bread
Apr 02 13:56:44 <hodapp>	the US has breweries that do every other weird flavor. maybe they could start doing kvass too.
Apr 02 13:56:47 <hodapp>	instead of shitty IPAs
Apr 02 13:56:59 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, I think it could catch on in the states
Apr 02 13:57:08 <hodapp>	can you make it taste like pine trees?
Apr 02 13:57:26 <kensanata>	I recently started growing my own sourdough...
Apr 02 13:57:35 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: usually it has a deep yeasty funk. I think the market to peel off in .us would be kombucha-drinkers

Apr 02 13:58:48 <wgreenhouse>	I like to add some ginger to mine but that's slightly unorthodox
Apr 02 13:58:58 <wgreenhouse>	(ginger also speeds the fermentation as it's usually carrying a lot of yeast naturally)
Apr 02 14:00:47 <hodapp>	I've not made ginger beer in awhile but I had an older recipe that made pretty wonderful results. it was not exactly soda but not exactly beer either; it'd get to maybe ~1% alcohol

Apr 02 15:44:33 <offby1>	*sigh* I'd vaguely thought I'd be in NY this May
Apr 02 15:44:34 <offby1>	guess not

Apr 02 15:45:13 <grym>	but otherwise quite russian indeed 
Apr 02 15:45:20 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: me too, I was commenting earlier I don't know why it hasn't caught on in .us to compete with kombucha for all these hippie drinkers of probiotic live cultured beverages
Apr 02 15:45:31 <isBEKaml>	grym: Brigton and Yarmouth are mostly rich Russians or rich retirees
Apr 02 15:45:34 <wgreenhouse>	we can compete with kombucha on garbage-taste
Apr 02 15:45:40 <wasamasa>	my father experimented with all kinds of fruit in it
Apr 02 15:45:41 <offby1>	I think I had kvass once.  It was fizzy.
Apr 02 15:46:00 <grym>	wgreenhouse: my mother in law is still kind of incredulous that kombucha is A Thing.  "what?  the thing we used to do at dacha to make tea last longer? you idiots are drinking that now?"

Apr 02 15:48:58 <offby1>	grym: heh indeed
Apr 02 15:49:18 <offby1>	that appeals to my ... snobbishness?  Reverse-snobbisheness?  Something anyway
Apr 02 15:49:33 <grym>	my inlaws are pretty fun 
Apr 02 15:49:39 <grym>	my extended inlaws .. less so 
Apr 02 15:50:55 <grym>	their kids all came out OK though, so that's good 
Apr 02 15:51:24 <wasamasa>	offby1: the kvass is making fizzy noises at the back of my room
Apr 02 15:51:52 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: so, how do you tell it's done fermenting, when the raisins turned into grapes again?
Apr 02 15:52:05 <wgreenhouse>	lolol
Apr 02 15:52:55 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: I think I just decided it was done by sight/taste, then bottled it
Apr 02 15:52:57 <hmw>	kensanata: Why does the water from boiling potatoes work as a starting point? Shouldn't life be mostly dead in that? Or is it used because of the starch and the bacteria come from somewhere else?
Apr 02 15:53:25 <hodapp>	I keep forgetting that salt-risen bread is a thing, and it requires no yeast.
Apr 02 15:53:32 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: if you did the raisin thing, there is some folklore about the raisins floating to the top
Apr 02 15:53:39 <wasamasa>	they are already there
Apr 02 15:53:54 <hodapp>	I have heard of people making wine out of raisins but never tried it
Apr 02 15:53:58 <wgreenhouse>	maybe try a taste tomorrow and see how it is
Apr 02 15:54:09 <wgreenhouse>	it is probably already funkier than store-bought
Apr 02 15:54:14 <wgreenhouse>	esp since you're using that beer yeast
Apr 02 15:54:40 <wasamasa>	well, not exactly
Apr 02 15:54:50 <wasamasa>	honey mead yeast, with a bulldog on the packaging
Apr 02 15:55:01 <wgreenhouse>	oh interesting
Apr 02 15:55:01 <wasamasa>	this can only go well
Apr 02 15:55:05 <wgreenhouse>	hahahah
Apr 02 15:56:19 <wasamasa>	boris has a tutorial for honey mead, too
Apr 02 15:56:45 <wgreenhouse>	yup
Apr 02 15:56:46 <grym>	hmw: it'll have a bunch of starch to eat and it's sterile.  then you add yeasties 
Apr 02 15:57:02 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: but regardless I think your timescale is probably compressed compared with using bread yeast
Apr 02 15:57:06 <grym>	wasamasa: mead mead 
Apr 02 15:57:21 <grym>	wasamasa: are you sure these are the right kind of bees, though? 
Apr 02 15:59:08 <hmw>	grym: Hm, from where? I guess the bacteria comes from the air, just like in the process of brewing some sorts of beer? In that case, water from boiling rice or any other starch should work as well.
Apr 02 15:59:16 <wasamasa>	https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07HJ3B3V4/
Apr 02 15:59:28 <grym>	hmw: yeah, any starchy water would be fine.  You'd add the yeast once the wort's cooled a bit 
Apr 02 15:59:39 <grym>	(if you have some brewer's yeast)
Apr 02 15:59:59 <wasamasa>	I've tried a teaspoon, there's definitely alcohol in it
Apr 02 16:00:34 <wgreenhouse>	it is basically up to you how far to go. mostly stops when bottled
Apr 02 16:00:56 <wgreenhouse>	if you go longer it will be less sweet and more boozy/funky
Apr 02 16:08:57 <wasamasa>	alright, I'll wait one more day and filter it into other jars
Apr 02 16:09:10 <wasamasa>	I'm just afraid filtering will undo the fizziness :<
Apr 02 16:10:28 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: as long as you don't extract all the yeast when bottling, it will still be very fizzy
Apr 02 16:10:35 <wgreenhouse>	to the point that it will make you a little nervous when opening
Apr 02 16:11:00 <grym>	friend of mine made us 5 gallons of mead with champagne yeast when i got married 
Apr 02 16:11:07 <grym>	and you need to wire the bottles shut 
Apr 02 16:11:14 <wgreenhouse>	hah
Apr 02 16:11:28 <grym>	it bottle conditions, so the first ones were SWEEET to the point of being kind of gross 
Apr 02 16:12:09 <grym>	5 months in the fridge produced a dry mead that was actually palatable! but we lost 1/3 of each bottle when we opened it, and the pressure was enough to send the cork from the third floor balcony about halfway across the back yard
Apr 02 16:12:15 <grym>	a fun trick at parties.
Apr 02 16:12:20 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 02 16:12:26 <kqr>	When I run e.g. describe-function, it does something very neat with windows: if there's only one window open, it splits the frame into two windows and uses one of the windows to display the documentation. If there are already two windows, it simply uses the other window. I would like one of my commands to do this as well – any pointers on how I can accomplish that?
Apr 02 16:12:39 <kqr>	(I feel like there is a built-in function that does just that, but I have not been able to find it.)
Apr 02 16:12:40 <grym>	we took to opening the last few bottles outdoors and pointed well away from us 
Apr 02 16:12:54 <grym>	the corks needed to be touched only slightly and then they'd uncork themselves
Apr 02 16:12:54 <wasamasa>	speaking of booze, I think my relatives still have that saber-shaped bottle of cognac
Apr 02 16:14:02 <grym>	wasamasa: https://youtu.be/sWJkIxnaUkg?t=1m31s
Apr 02 16:14:21 <grym>	pro tip, don't do this 
Apr 02 16:14:29 <wgreenhouse>	kqr: the main entry point is `display-buffer' which has some rather arcane rules
Apr 02 16:16:33 <wasamasa>	grym: lol, how do these people even survive
Apr 02 16:16:58 <grym>	alton's delightful 
Apr 02 16:17:09 <grym>	but sabering things is derpy as hell :D 
Apr 02 16:17:37 <wasamasa>	naturally there's kalashnikov-shaped vodka, too
Apr 02 16:18:09 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: I think that stuff is even licensed by the Kalashnikov family
Apr 02 16:18:16 <wgreenhouse>	with knock-offs, of course
Apr 02 16:37:09 *	hodapp blinks
Apr 02 16:37:24 <hodapp>	apparently my phone's camera records video in 3840x2160 120fps by default.
Apr 02 16:37:31 <hodapp>	this seems like a tad bit of overkill.
Apr 02 16:41:19 <notzmv>	just a bit
Apr 02 16:41:43 <notzmv>	gotta have high quality tiktoks with today's youth
Apr 02 16:41:46 <notzmv>	:^)
Apr 02 16:44:08 <kqr>	wgreenhouse, thank you, that was helpful!
Apr 02 16:44:38 <wasamasa>	speaking of the topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fslh2h/dbc_control_how_and_where_to_open_buffers/
Apr 02 16:44:57 <wasamasa>	the author of that thing didn't seem as enthusiastic as me :D
Apr 02 17:53:10 <excelsiora>	can I just put `emacs --daemon` like that in my bashrc?
Apr 02 17:53:40 <wasamasa>	if anything, in .bash_profile
Apr 02 17:54:54 <excelsiora>	it's a little verbose because of spacemacs
Apr 02 17:56:26 <excelsiora>	wasn't there supposed to be a new standard where we would put our dotfiles, like in a .config directory or something?
Apr 02 17:56:43 <wasamasa>	yes, XDG
Apr 02 17:57:00 <excelsiora>	is that still relevant for a server?
Apr 02 17:57:12 <wasamasa>	it's relevant for config files
Apr 02 17:57:59 <excelsiora>	were we also going to put our e.g. .emacs.d and .vimrc in there as well?
Apr 02 17:58:07 <wasamasa>	it replaces .emacs.d
Apr 02 17:58:31 <wasamasa>	vim doesn't follow that standard
Apr 02 17:58:33 <excelsiora>	does emacs look there now?
Apr 02 17:58:39 <wasamasa>	as of emacs 27, yes
Apr 02 17:58:57 <excelsiora>	ok, who's going to tell the vim guys?
Apr 02 17:59:08 <wasamasa>	vim is a one man effort, lol
Apr 02 17:59:13 <wasamasa>	if anything, neovim does it
Apr 02 17:59:30 <Twist>	Well, that's sexy.
Apr 02 17:59:53 <Twist>	hodapp: Have you seen ox-twbs yet?
Apr 02 18:00:03 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: to really be XDG-compliant we ought to split out ~/.config/emacs from ~/.cache/emacs
Apr 02 18:00:13 <wgreenhouse>	I assume that nobody has thought that far
Apr 02 18:00:16 <wasamasa>	hence why neovim calls it partial support
Apr 02 18:00:31 <hodapp>	Twist: is that a new strain of SARS-CoV-2?
Apr 02 18:00:45 <wasamasa>	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_dev/ieoldm29ymM
Apr 02 18:01:04 <excelsiora>	k, I love you guys but I have to reboot so take care!! :P
Apr 02 18:01:21 <JordiGH>	Oh good.
Apr 02 18:01:23 <Twist>	hodapp: No, but it will infect your orgmode html export with bootstrap.
Apr 02 18:01:32 <JordiGH>	I thought for a moment you were going to halt.
Apr 02 18:01:36 <hodapp>	Twist: Hmmmm. I was already trying to get my org-mode stuff to coexist with Hugo.
Apr 02 18:01:38 <JordiGH>	Sounded like a suicide note there.
Apr 02 18:03:22 <Twist>	Looks like there's an ox-hugo too.
Apr 02 18:03:38 *	Twist loses 10 minutes exploring Hugo.
Apr 02 18:03:39 <fsbot>	oops,  Bad bounding indices: 10, 0
Apr 02 18:04:16 <hodapp>	Twist: https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo/issues/333 there's me
Apr 02 18:05:17 <hodapp>	and I admit that that is at least 50% my fault for feeding it really ugly org documents, and I'd gladly fix them, except that I keep running into things like this and I have to basically do a manual binary tree search to find the offending lines
Apr 02 18:05:36 <ngz>	hodapp: Does M-x org-lint help?
Apr 02 18:06:10 <hodapp>	ngz: trying it now. As far as org care, the file is fine.
Apr 02 18:10:46 <bpalmer>	Let's insist our conversations respect transaction atomicity and consistency.
Apr 02 18:11:54 <bpalmer>	rudybot: however, durability is optional in a two party consent state.
Apr 02 18:12:11 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I've been pretty pleased w/ the durability of my unibody mbp
Apr 02 18:13:17 <hodapp>	ngz: thanks, this found some things that may or may not matter but deserve attention anyway
Apr 02 18:17:47 <lxsameer>	hey folks, is it possible to get access to the file name and the line number where a macro is being called within the macro
Apr 02 18:27:46 <wasamasa>	,tias
Apr 02 18:27:47 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 02 18:28:03 <wasamasa>	I suspect it isn't
Apr 02 18:29:10 <rpav>	if elisp backtraces are anything to go by, it doesn't store that info at *all* ;/
Apr 02 18:29:17 <wasamasa>	in my test it returns the location of point when evaluating the macro
Apr 02 18:30:26 <wasamasa>	when compiling, the location of the end of the enclosing form
Apr 02 18:31:16 <rpav>	wait, waht gives you that?
Apr 02 18:31:25 <wasamasa>	http://ix.io/2gns
Apr 02 18:31:47 <wasamasa>	bonus: both calls of the macro returns return the same thing
Apr 02 18:31:48 <rpav>	oh bah that's not going to do it ;)
Apr 02 18:32:00 <wasamasa>	of course, but lxsameer needs something to start with
Apr 02 18:32:06 <rpav>	you don't want buffer-related things, you'd need metadata from the reader
Apr 02 18:33:50 <wasamasa>	it's still funny, shows a bit about how the interpreter works
Apr 02 18:34:15 <wasamasa>	read a form, advance point, eval it, repeat
Apr 02 18:34:47 <wasamasa>	you could probably use it as debugging help just fine
Apr 02 18:34:55 <rpav>	yeah that can definitely help demonstrate what-happens-when
Apr 02 18:37:21 <wasamasa>	I could imagine someone hacking things up to the degree of guessing for you which line the error occurred at :D
Apr 02 18:43:42 <rpav>	*actually* .. i think the info might mostly be there, but not accessible from lisp and/or too late
Apr 02 18:48:39 <rpav>	whoa. you sortof can.
Apr 02 18:49:02 <wasamasa>	I await your insights with baited breath
Apr 02 18:49:50 <rpav>	https://gist.github.com/rpav/615b876a3ec6eb85499cbf6939ca23dc
Apr 02 18:50:33 <wasamasa>	interesting
Apr 02 18:50:37 <rpav>	i was looking in read / read_internal_start and notice Vread_symbol_positions_list .. which seemed like it mihgt be a defvar from the name, and is 
Apr 02 18:50:52 <rpav>	that doesn't get you file, but it does get some vaguely interesting reader info
Apr 02 18:51:08 <wasamasa>	it's not in the elisp reference
Apr 02 18:52:31 <wasamasa>	the thing is that you don't want to permanently enable this
Apr 02 18:53:42 <wasamasa>	it's used by compile-defun
Apr 02 18:54:53 <rpav>	bah load has a Vloads_in_progress but it doesn't look usefully accessible
Apr 02 18:55:06 <rpav>	yeah but if you're just debugging, a let or something mgiht be sufficient
Apr 02 18:56:53 <rpav>	aha! current-load-list
Apr 02 18:57:27 <rpav>	put a `(message "%s" current-load-list)` in like, /tmp/foo.el, and (load "/tmp/foo.el") it
Apr 02 18:58:07 <rpav>	the stuff in read-symbol-positions-list just looks like it's offset from the current toplevel form though so not quite 100% 
Apr 02 18:59:00 <nikitamog>	Heyo, folks.
Apr 02 19:02:33 <nikitamog>	I'm having the worst time getting emacs to recognize my fonts.

Apr 02 22:11:52 <bandali>	on emacs-26.3, with the above htmlize library, i get:
Apr 02 22:11:55 <bandali>	cons: Args out of range: "interactive", -1, 0
Apr 02 22:11:59 <bandali>	when doing M-x scpaste RET
Apr 02 22:12:06 <bandali>	scpaste-region seems to work just fine tho
Apr 02 22:13:32 <bandali>	anyone able to reproduce?
Apr 02 22:15:58 <rpav>	ah, find-file-at-point .. sometimes the little things make all the difference
Apr 02 22:15:59 <bandali>	ha, but it works fine with the old htmlize technomancy uses
Apr 02 22:16:20 <technomancy>	never upgrade!
Apr 02 22:16:31 <bandali>	LOL
Apr 02 22:16:48 <bandali>	technomancy, would you consider tho? :-p
Apr 02 22:17:35 <technomancy>	bandali: I think I'd rather move to htmlfontify than upgrade htmlize if something has to change
Apr 02 22:17:42 <nikitamog>	Miyu-saki: What part of fc-list output is the font name that the system recognizes?
Apr 02 22:17:54 <nikitamog>	'/home/nikita/.local/share/fonts/Input_Fonts/InputMono/InputMono/InputMono-Light.ttf: Input Mono,InputMono Light:style=Light,Regular'
Apr 02 22:18:27 <nikitamog>	That works fine on my ubuntu right here and it's exactly the same in gentoo.
Apr 02 22:18:55 <bandali>	ha
Apr 02 22:20:15 <technomancy>	bandali: unfortunately it's still pretty gross with htmlfontify https://p.hagelb.org/scpaste-new.el.html
Apr 02 22:21:18 <Miyu-saki>	nikitamog: Have you tried `InputMono Light`?
Apr 02 22:21:24 <bandali>	god damn it, why doesn't it use a monospace type face
Apr 02 22:21:27 <Miyu-saki>	Or well, `Input Mono:style=light`
Apr 02 22:24:16 <bandali>	hm, actually, it looks way better on my end, with emacs-26.3
Apr 02 22:25:04 <technomancy>	huh, scp can copy both files in a single shot instead of invoking two scp commands
Apr 02 22:25:11 <technomancy>	why the heck didn't I do that ages ago?
Apr 02 22:25:12 <nikitamog>	Miyu-saki: I'm trying a bunch of different chunks and it still throws undefined at me. I'll try something that isn't a ttf I provided.
Apr 02 22:25:53 <udbhav>	I'm trying to learn how to make decisions on when/if I should normalize a large table with varchar fields that are used for categorization purposes, any resources you could point me to?
Apr 02 22:26:49 <bandali>	technomancy, htmlize-buffer: https://p.bndl.org htmlfontify-buffer: https://p.bndl.org/scpaste.el.html
Apr 02 22:26:55 <ecbrown>	udbhav: #postgresql?
Apr 02 22:27:01 <bandali>	technomancy, the latter looks nearly identical to what i see in emacs itself :-)
Apr 02 22:27:27 <udbhav>	lol whoops, wrong tab haha
Apr 02 22:27:30 <udbhav>	thank you
Apr 02 22:27:41 <ecbrown>	udbhav: though a more serious answer is, always maximize normalization until it hurts
Apr 02 22:27:55 <technomancy>	bandali: the latter looks really bad here
Apr 02 22:27:56 <ecbrown>	at least, according to the Codd-Date school
Apr 02 22:27:57 <udbhav>	thanks, that's helpful
Apr 02 22:28:19 <ecbrown>	it's not always easy, because database tables are often times part of an implementaiton
Apr 02 22:28:21 <technomancy>	bandali: the non-colored symbols are in a completely different font
Apr 02 22:28:24 <bandali>	technomancy, the html file on my server? can you give a screenshot? i'll give you one in a sec
Apr 02 22:29:00 <ecbrown>	udbhav: and unfortunately from a Relational Theory point of view, optimization is different than the concerns of the calculus. 
Apr 02 22:29:41 <technomancy>	bandali: yeah https://p.hagelb.org/htmlfontify.png
Apr 02 22:29:54 <technomancy>	I mean... not *really* bad, but still definitely wrong
Apr 02 22:30:15 <udbhav>	ecbrown: lost me a bit, what do you mean by the tables being a part of the implementation?
Apr 02 22:30:53 <ecbrown>	udbhav: there's a mantra "de-normalize for performance"
Apr 02 22:31:19 <ecbrown>	but that catches up to you in design: you end up having to GROUP BY or DISTINCT every darned time
Apr 02 22:31:27 <bandali>	technomancy, are they really in a different font?
Apr 02 22:31:31 <bandali>	here's what i see btw: https://p.bndl.org/scpaste.el.png
Apr 02 22:31:55 <ecbrown>	really SQL should not need to have DISTINCT: rows should always be unique and therefore normalized
Apr 02 22:32:06 <technomancy>	bandali: yes, definitely a different size; possibly the same face
Apr 02 22:32:08 <udbhav>	gotcha, thanks, that makes sense
Apr 02 22:32:22 <udbhav>	i'm gonna... add an index
Apr 02 22:32:23 <ecbrown>	cheers 
Apr 02 22:32:49 <bandali>	technomancy, in the screenshot you gave, can you point to two example differences? also, can you double check with firefox's Inspect Element?
Apr 02 22:33:30 <technomancy>	bandali: scpaste-el-location is several pixels shorter than replace-regexp-in-string, for instance
Apr 02 22:35:26 <technomancy>	bandali: the inspector refuses to tell me the font size of replace-regexp-in-string; when I click it, it says "no element selected"
Apr 02 22:36:21 <bandali>	technomancy, ha, that'd be because replace-regexp-in-string is part of the text of its containing element (the pre, i believe) rather than in a span, like scpaste-el-location is
Apr 02 22:37:02 <technomancy>	anyway the fonts are clearly inconsistent
Apr 02 22:37:14 <bandali>	right
Apr 02 22:37:17 <technomancy>	plus htmlfontify encodes COPYRIGHT SIGN as Â©
Apr 02 22:37:19 <bandali>	let me see if i can pin down the issue
Apr 02 22:37:25 <bandali>	yeah, that's an encoding issue
Apr 02 22:37:34 <bandali>	same with el files on your server
Apr 02 22:37:46 <bandali>	e.g. https://p.hagelb.org/index
Apr 02 22:38:20 <technomancy>	ah, so maybe that's an issue with HTTP headers sent by the server
Apr 02 22:38:25 <technomancy>	but still, htmlize works fine
Apr 02 22:38:55 <bandali>	right. or maybe htmlfontify needs some tweaking
Apr 02 22:39:03 <bandali>	shouldn't be a big deal
Apr 02 22:44:07 <bandali>	the reason for different fonts is that the styles set on <body> don't apply to <pre>, at least not all of them
Apr 02 22:44:19 <bandali>	looking to see if it's something easily fixable within htmlfontify
Apr 02 22:44:49 <technomancy>	problem is htmlfontify ships with emacs, so fixing it takes years =(
Apr 02 22:45:51 <bandali>	i wonder if i could get it in for emacs-27
Apr 02 22:46:17 <bandali>	but yeah, it'll take a while for those on debian, redhat, ..., and that don't compile their own emacs
Apr 02 22:46:22 <bandali>	e.g. you, i guess :-p
Apr 02 22:46:52 <bandali>	the culprit is in hfy-sprintf-stylesheet btw
Apr 02 23:16:45 <danielboston26>	Hi i am trying to run slime when i do i get an error saying no such file or directory lisp
Apr 02 23:18:42 <technomancy>	did you ... install common lisp?
Apr 02 23:19:15 <danielboston26>	yes
Apr 02 23:19:18 <danielboston26>	sbcl
Apr 02 23:19:23 <danielboston26>	i can run it fine
Apr 02 23:19:57 <danielboston26>	when i tried setq inferior lisp sbcl that didn't work either
Apr 02 23:20:36 <technomancy>	inferior lisp is for the built-in thing; slime has a different defvar
Apr 02 23:20:46 <technomancy>	not sure what it's called; slime-something-command probably
Apr 02 23:21:27 <danielboston26>	anyone know?
Apr 02 23:22:17 <danielboston26>	its (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/local/bin/sbcl --noinform")
Apr 02 23:22:50 <danielboston26>	idk what --noinform does but that fixed it
Apr 02 23:23:55 <markasoftware>	"suppress the printing of any banner or other informational message at startup."
Apr 02 23:24:01 <technomancy>	inferior-lisp isn't slime
Apr 02 23:24:12 <technomancy>	slime is superior lisp interaction method for emacs
Apr 02 23:26:27 <technomancy>	literally the opposite of inferior lisp =)
Apr 02 23:35:14 <hodapp>	technomancy: by the way, when you posted a week or two ago the Racket REPL in Emacs with inline images, how does one achieve that support?
Apr 02 23:36:07 <technomancy>	hodapp: I was using racket-mode; I think geiser.el supports it too
Apr 02 23:36:16 <hodapp>	it just understands how to do images?
Apr 02 23:36:46 <technomancy>	I think it probably tells racket to base64-encode them or something? not sure of the implementation details
Apr 02 23:36:50 <technomancy>	but greghendershott would know =)

Apr 03 09:24:35 <jcay>	hey, guys, I am a little lost, where do I find/create the configuration file for emacs on debian?? it has ~/.emacs.d/ but it's a dir and only has auto-save stuff. I tried ~/.emacs.d/init.el, but it doesn't seem to work ;/
Apr 03 09:25:11 <thblt>	It's ~/.emacs.d/init.el
Apr 03 09:25:23 <thblt>	,doesntwork
Apr 03 09:25:24 <fsbot>	We can help you with your problem better if your error description is more informative than "it doesn't work"
Apr 03 09:30:10 <jcay>	I am a very n00b here, tried "(setq custom-tab-width 4)" but it still does what it wants
Apr 03 09:32:15 <thblt>	custom-tab-width isn't a variable.
Apr 03 09:32:54 <thblt>	You probably meant (setq-default tab-width 4)
Apr 03 09:35:05 <jcay>	ah, now it does what I want, thanks
Apr 03 09:58:40 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: computation disconnected because custom-tab-width exploded
Apr 03 09:58:41 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I wonder if the gas plant that exploded earlier did more real damage
Apr 03 10:01:34 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: all plants need carbon dioxide gas for photo synthesis
Apr 03 10:01:37 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Aura_OMI_Nitrogen_dioxide_troposphere_column.png <-- China
Apr 03 10:05:39 <thblt>	Is there a way to get the (future) value of server-name in init.el with emacs --daemon=name?
Apr 03 10:07:13 <thblt>	after-init-hook doesn't work.
Apr 03 11:09:56 <fledermaus>	have you tried turning your jet liner off and then on again: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/04/02/boeing_787_power_cycle_51_days_stale_data/
Apr 03 11:46:34 <thblt>	What's a bit surprising is that it seems to imply aircrafts aren't powered off after each flight.
Apr 03 11:57:30 <siraben>	Has anyone had the issue with C-c C-p C-s [preview-section] in AucTeX causing mark to activate and select a region?
Apr 03 12:00:31 <siraben>	OTOH,  C-c C-p C-d [preview-document] works as intended, without weird selections
Apr 03 12:12:34 <quiliro>	Would anyone please check on https://termbin.com/msxq if the commented contents assign the same value to the date variable as the non-commented ones?
Apr 03 12:16:50 <quiliro>	Would the original (commented) date assignment be more clean code?
Apr 03 12:17:22 <quiliro>	Or is my latest modification (uncommented) good praactice?
Apr 03 12:27:38 <wasamasa>	neither are assignments
Apr 03 12:28:54 <wasamasa>	you could even make three bindings out of that
Apr 03 12:29:26 <wasamasa>	you start with something resembling a timestamp, then split on "T", then join
Apr 03 12:29:57 <wasamasa>	it's hard to tell what's going on since the format of the data is unknown and the variable names aren't descriptive
Apr 03 12:30:32 <wasamasa>	if I had to guess, you have a timestamp of the <date>T<time> form and want to convert it to the <date>-<time> form
Apr 03 12:35:50 <wasamasa>	or perhaps you want to turn <date> into something where the dashes have been replaced with slashes
Apr 03 12:36:29 <wasamasa>	in which case it would be better to have a datetime variable, a date variable, then use `replace-regexp-in-string' on it
Apr 03 12:40:27 <quiliro>	This is the whole file https://termbin.com/pnvo
Apr 03 12:40:52 <quiliro>	dashes to slashes , yes
Apr 03 12:41:16 <quiliro>	<date>T<time> to <date>
Apr 03 12:42:32 <quiliro>	wasamasa: So you think that using several variables is better (as in the commented area) than just assigning everything to one variable?
Apr 03 12:42:51 <wasamasa>	yes, it makes it easier to follow what's going on
Apr 03 12:43:05 <quiliro>	Thank you for your suggestion
Apr 03 12:43:12 <quiliro>	s
Apr 03 12:43:40 <quiliro>	will try to use replace-regexp-in-string
Apr 03 12:44:04 <quiliro>	and will try to use datetime variable
Apr 03 12:44:18 <quiliro>	any other suggestion?
Apr 03 12:45:11 <wasamasa>	you use two different ways of formatting let bindings
Apr 03 12:45:33 <quiliro>	datetime , date , newdate
Apr 03 12:45:39 <quiliro>	what do you mean?
Apr 03 12:46:11 <wasamasa>	look at the let forms in your example and you'll see
Apr 03 12:48:39 <wasamasa>	in one you're putting the value always on a new line, in the other it's on the same line as the variable
Apr 03 12:49:05 <wasamasa>	that aside, I have doubts your regex-replace search will actually replace anything
Apr 03 12:49:10 <wasamasa>	$ has a special meaning in regex
Apr 03 12:49:25 <wasamasa>	you'd have to use \\$ if you want to match dollar signs
Apr 03 12:50:01 <quiliro>	ok...I thought it did...maybe I added it manually to the result....nice observation
Apr 03 12:50:37 <wasamasa>	and all that stuff ends up in the current buffer
Apr 03 12:50:46 <wasamasa>	oh no, it doesn't
Apr 03 12:51:10 <wasamasa>	so no more plans to do CSV?
Apr 03 12:51:45 <quiliro>	no... the intention was to make it work with ledger-mode...
Apr 03 12:51:54 <quiliro>	ledger has a csv importer
Apr 03 12:52:18 <wasamasa>	then I'm looking forward how that mapping will be done :>
Apr 03 12:52:19 <quiliro>	that is why I thought it would be good to make a CSV
Apr 03 12:52:43 <quiliro>	but this script imports it directly......it works
Apr 03 12:53:04 <quiliro>	I have still to work on it more though
Apr 03 12:53:15 <quiliro>	BBIAW
Apr 03 13:29:48 <quiliro>	wasamasa: Which is bad, to put the values on the same line as the variable or to put them on another line?
Apr 03 13:30:13 <quiliro>	s/,/:/
Apr 03 13:47:15 <wasamasa>	quiliro: look at other elisp code and tell me :>
Apr 03 14:04:17 <quiliro>	wasamasa: esxml--css-selector-token-matchers shows the values of variables on the same lines as their names.
Apr 03 14:04:30 <quiliro>	will inspect code from others too
Apr 03 14:05:40 <quiliro>	checked all of esxml-query.el and it has that same practice on all let s-exps
Apr 03 14:06:24 <quiliro>	except when they are too long
Apr 03 14:12:35 <quiliro>	last statement is false
Apr 03 14:12:49 <quiliro>	there are no long variable assignments
Apr 03 14:13:02 <wasamasa>	truly a mystery
Apr 03 14:13:13 <quiliro>	on esxml-query.el
Apr 03 14:13:16 <jamik>	Hello friends, I often use `auto-fill-mode` for writing text documents but when I go back to edit previous lines I mess up the width of those lines. I've been tragically fixing this manually for a while but since I'm writing more these days I need a better solution. Particularly, is there a way to take a block of lines and run some command to remove/insert newlines such that each line follows the rule that `auto-fill-mode` would use?
Apr 03 14:13:27 <wasamasa>	anyway, this document applies to lisp coding in general: https://mumble.net/~campbell/scheme/style.txt
Apr 03 14:14:43 <quiliro>	ok wasamasa that is better than irony :-)
Apr 03 14:16:15 <wasamasa>	there's similar tips in the elisp reference
Apr 03 14:16:38 <quiliro>	ok...have a lot of homewerk then :-)
Apr 03 14:18:43 <hmw>	jamik: Esc q in the paragraph might be what you are looking for
Apr 03 14:20:50 <jamik>	Wow, works like a charm, thanks hmw!
Apr 03 14:22:05 <quiliro>	,fill
Apr 03 14:22:05 <fsbot>	whoops,  Wrong number of arguments: (lambda (str) (let ((temp-buffer (generate-new-buffer " *temp*"))) (save-current-buffer (set-buffer temp-buffer) (unwind-protect (progn (insert str) (let ((fill-column fsi-internal-fill-column)) (text-mode) (fill-region (point-min) (point-max)) (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max)))) (and (buffer-name temp-buffer) (kill-buffer temp-buffer)))))), 0
Apr 03 14:22:27 <quiliro>	what is fill paragraph?
Apr 03 14:24:07 <quiliro>	fill-paragraph' describe-funciton says "Fill paragraph at or after point.". It is a definition using the same word.
Apr 03 14:26:07 <wasamasa>	hard-wrap text using the value of fill-column
Apr 03 14:26:11 <wasamasa>	check the emacs manual for more
Apr 03 14:26:55 <jamik>	Fill paragraph is exactly what I was looking for in my question above quiliro 
Apr 03 14:27:01 <quiliro>	I have noticed i must read Emacs manual, Emacs Lisp Introduction and Emacs Lisp manual completely before asking further questions.
Apr 03 14:27:16 <wasamasa>	no, just the parts relevant to your questions
Apr 03 14:27:29 <quiliro>	ok...nice shortcut!
Apr 03 14:27:47 <quiliro>	But it would be good to read them completely too
Apr 03 14:27:58 <jamik>	Basically if the lines in a paragraph are shorter or longer than the value in `fill-column` it will resolve that for the entire paragraph.
Apr 03 14:28:44 <jamik>	I think it might take you a very long time to scour every manual page for emacs but more power to you!
Apr 03 15:15:10 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: to "fill" means to insert newlines into the paragraph so that lines are not longer than `fill-column'
Apr 03 15:28:53 <wasamasa>	quiliro: I have my doubts anyone read the whole thing fully
Apr 03 15:29:01 <wasamasa>	quiliro: maybe if they were really bored and had a month off
Apr 03 15:39:02 <rnkn>	whoa
Apr 03 15:39:05 <rnkn>	lotta users online
Apr 03 15:39:27 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: the kvass experiment is nearing its completion, I wonder how long to refrigerate the brew to ensure the yeast is inactive
Apr 03 15:41:11 <rnkn>	anyone know if there's a legit comparable alternative to fastmail?
Apr 03 15:42:20 <wasamasa>	snailmail??
Apr 03 15:42:20 <fsbot>	Reply unclear, try again
Apr 03 15:44:36 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: yeasts are wimpy about cold. most fermentation will stop pretty quickly (in a few hours), though they will continue to produce some CO2 for a longer tail (so you should use good bottles/jars designed for brewing or for holding carbonated liquids)
Apr 03 15:44:57 <rnkn>	"Snail Mail My Email is a worldwide community art project where volunteers handwrite strangers' emails and send physical letters to the intended recipients, free of charge." - snailmailmyemail.org
Apr 03 15:45:02 <wgreenhouse>	(except for lager yeasts which are weird and like cold)
Apr 03 15:45:18 <wasamasa>	alright, then I'll give it a try this evening
Apr 03 15:45:22 <codingquark>	wassup peeps?
Apr 03 15:46:58 <codingquark>	The lowest it gets here is 4°C
Apr 03 15:47:20 <codingquark>	At night only, for 2 hours/day, for one month a year.
Apr 03 15:47:36 <codingquark>	Should give a lot of time for yeast cultures.
Apr 03 15:48:02 <wasamasa>	I'm curious about the beets version with sauerkraut that doesn't use any yeast at all
Apr 03 15:48:11 <wasamasa>	naturally it looks less like apple juice
Apr 03 15:49:07 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, that is a lactofermented drink
Apr 03 15:49:24 <wgreenhouse>	based on the bacteria from the sauerkraut and the freeriders on the beets themselves
Apr 03 15:50:31 <wgreenhouse>	it is also a base for sauces and braises
Apr 03 15:50:53 <codingquark>	Do lactobacilli change taste? By how much?
Apr 03 15:51:16 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: typically they make things sour or tart
Apr 03 15:51:26 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 03 15:51:35 <wgreenhouse>	but it depends on the strain, and what they're working on
Apr 03 15:54:17 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: there are lactofermented soups that you can use beet kvass for
Apr 03 15:56:49 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: yogurt and kefir and the like are mostly lacto-fermentation
Apr 03 15:58:14 <codingquark>	wgreenhouse: well, I imagine kvass will taste very different from yogurt though?
Apr 03 15:59:07 <wgreenhouse>	bread kvass is mostly yeast fermentation (though there will be some incidental presence of lactobacilli if you're using a sour rye bread, which is the traditional way)
Apr 03 15:59:34 <wgreenhouse>	so it is more "beery" though it has its own hard to describe flavor

Apr 03 20:50:37 <aidalgol>	white_magic: I agree VSCode does a lot of things right, but I really hate JetBrains' IDEs.
Apr 03 20:50:50 <aidalgol>	Not as much as I hate Visual Studio, but close.
Apr 03 20:51:21 <white_magic>	aidalgol: personally, I'm not even well-versed in the JB IDEs but I know and have tried some of their refactoring abilities. The level of intuition the have on the code is unparalleled.
Apr 03 20:51:41 <white_magic>	aidalgol: imho Visual Studio is a damn fine IDE. Not unixy in any shape or form, though, of course.
Apr 03 20:51:54 <white_magic>	The most you can do is add vim bindings to it
Apr 03 20:52:21 <white_magic>	But if you haven't used Visual Studio in some years, you would be surprised how far along it has come
Apr 03 20:52:35 <white_magic>	fuzzy file searching, much better refactoring abilities
Apr 03 20:52:42 <white_magic>	I would argue it's more performant and stable, too
Apr 03 20:54:00 <grym>	i use vs for c#, pycharm for big python, and emacs for the rest of the world 
Apr 03 20:54:07 <aidalgol>	Last version I used was Visual Studio 2017.  Yes, it's come a long way, but soooo much of the UI is garbage.
Apr 03 20:54:26 <grym>	it's just a very domain specific tool
Apr 03 20:54:45 <roadie>	I use it for crysis modding
Apr 03 20:55:20 <roadie>	or, I will when I get to that
Apr 03 20:55:27 <aidalgol>	My main issue with JetBrains is how little keyboard accessibility there is.  It forces you to keep moving over to the mouse for common tasks.
Apr 03 20:55:32 <aidalgol>	roadie: haha!
Apr 03 20:55:41 <dale>	aidalgol: That is also my #1 beef with IDEA.
Apr 03 20:55:53 <aidalgol>	I got tired of Crysis at around the vehicle sections in chapter 2.
Apr 03 20:56:09 <dale>	aidalgol: To be honest, though, the rest of the product is pretty good.  If you enable the Emacs key bindings, then fix them on macOS, then maybe install some add-ons to do even more keyboard stuff you get... just pretty close.
Apr 03 20:56:35 <dale>	I think I actually have an SO question about IDEA keyboard navigability that is my most-up-voted question.
Apr 03 20:56:36 <aidalgol>	dale: Anyway, I'm done talking to heathens. :P
Apr 03 20:57:18 <aidalgol>	But it (Crysis) was already feeling tired before then.  Even on the highest difficulty, the infiltration mission in the harbour was mostly shooting dumb AI in the face as they lined up for execution.
Apr 03 20:57:34 <dale>	Yes, here we go, four years ago: "Allow page up/down in Python console [in PyCharm]", still open.  https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-18640
Apr 03 20:57:44 <aidalgol>	wth is youtrack?
Apr 03 20:57:52 <white_magic>	aidalgol: I'll grant you that the UI is kinda meh. But still.. even so.. consider this little thing: if you press 'Ctrl-Q', it takes you to this 'quick search', where you can search through various options in the IDE. Sounds like a small thing but it is not a small thing at all. This allows for better options/features discoverability than almost any IDE out there.
Apr 03 20:58:06 <dale>	aidalgol: YouTube videos of random people on the street reading bug reports.
Apr 03 20:58:15 <dale>	aidalgol: Just kidding, it's JetBrains's answer to Jira.
Apr 03 20:58:44 <roadie>	aidalgol: interesting - which FPS AI is the best you have played against?
Apr 03 20:59:12 <white_magic>	dale: PyCharm is actually quite buggy.. It's crazy how many little bugs there are. A few days ago, I found out that .. get this.. debugging broke - no idea why. It just never stops at breakpoints. I dug in a little bit. Spent like 20 minutes trying to fix it. Found various complaints and bugs on forums. After this I ditched PyCharm.
Apr 03 20:59:36 <white_magic>	I have had other annoyances with it too. Like, for example, its very lazy support of jupyter notebooks. A truly lackluster effort on their part.
Apr 03 21:00:05 <white_magic>	I think PyCharm is not a major focus of JetBrains
Apr 03 21:00:10 <dale>	As an Emacs user, what kills me the most about JetBrains IDEs is that I guess you have to restart them to install/remove/update extensions?
Apr 03 21:00:35 <white_magic>	dale: i don't think that's true anymore. Sometimes they prompt you to restart.. i think when installing a some 'beta' theme. But not usually
Apr 03 21:01:13 <white_magic>	roadie: I can chime in on the best FPS AI. Crysis & Far Cry definitely have some of the best. But also: S.T.A.L.K.E.R., F.E.A.R., and Half-Life 1 & 2
Apr 03 21:01:21 <white_magic>	all of those have realllly good AI
Apr 03 21:01:38 <white_magic>	F.E.A.R. probably has the best imho
Apr 03 21:03:55 <roadie>	white_magic: I have heard a few times that the F.E.A.R AI is great.
Apr 03 21:06:38 <white_magic>	roadie: I can attest to that. I also watched this YT vid that said that they didn't even do the most fancy of coding for its AI but rather worked at each level to provide waypointing/behaviors to the AI
Apr 03 21:07:18 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Emacs has had apropos for ages.
Apr 03 21:07:45 <white_magic>	roadie: the AI in FEAR will surprise you. The scariest thing is when you expect them to be hiding from you because you threw some nade or did suppressive fire. Then you find out .. they flanked you!
Apr 03 21:07:50 <aidalgol>	roadie: I hardly play FPS, so you're asking the wrong person.  Also, level design is almost as important as AI.
Apr 03 21:08:07 <aidalgol>	white_magic: I feel like the one person in the world who was unimpressed with the FEAR AI.
Apr 03 21:08:14 <aidalgol>	It was so obviously scripted.
Apr 03 21:08:17 <white_magic>	aidalgol: Yes, Emacs has things like that, but many mainstream IDEs don't. You just end up clicking and googling a lot to find some settings
Apr 03 21:08:19 <white_magic>	*setting
Apr 03 21:08:20 <aidalgol>	That's what made it great, but it wasn't surprising.
Apr 03 21:08:39 <white_magic>	aidalgol: maybe if you replay it, you figure out how it's scripted but I think I played it like once only
Apr 03 21:09:07 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Same.
Apr 03 21:09:10 <aidalgol>	I was bored.
Apr 03 21:09:28 <white_magic>	aidalgol: well one thing I did was I basically didn't use slo-mo at all
Apr 03 21:09:30 <aidalgol>	Maybe because I approach games looking for patterns.
Apr 03 21:09:32 <roadie>	they use waypoint decision making and maybe flanking / groupID like the crysis AI - the scripting is just that they all want to tell the story the player is supposed to see
Apr 03 21:09:37 <white_magic>	so it was more real-time for me and way way way more intense than perhaps intended
Apr 03 21:10:11 <aidalgol>	I mean, yes, it was more impressive than most FPS because the squads acted as a squad, but they were still pretty dumb.
Apr 03 21:10:36 <roadie>	you don't play FPS ... :)
Apr 03 21:10:37 <technomancy>	speaking of first person shooters, this is pretty impressive https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/108725-doom-4-vanilla-v259-new-version/?page=25
Apr 03 21:11:09 <aidalgol>	IIRC, Half-Life 2, which I found it to drag in places, had decent AI that didn't *always* just run at you to get mowed down.
Apr 03 21:11:21 <aidalgol>	Again, that was probably good level design as much as AI.
Apr 03 21:11:25 <white_magic>	aidalgol: what do you think of the Far Cry AI?
Apr 03 21:12:00 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Never played any.
Apr 03 21:12:04 <roadie>	we need a grid in the level so the AI can pretend it knows where it is - the rest is easy
Apr 03 21:12:17 <white_magic>	aidalgol: iirc far cry 1 had really good AI
Apr 03 21:12:23 <aidalgol>	roadie: I *did* say.
Apr 03 21:12:30 <roadie>	you did
Apr 03 21:12:32 <roadie>	:)
Apr 03 21:12:37 <aidalgol>	Not even for historical interest to see the origins of Ubisoft Sandbox Syndrome.
Apr 03 21:12:54 <aidalgol>	roadie: I prefer stealth games or vaguely tactical shooters.
Apr 03 21:13:10 <aidalgol>	I liked the gunplay in Shadow of Chernobyl.  Just found the story dull.
Apr 03 21:13:11 <roadie>	FarCry 1 is legendary :) and stealth is fun in that game
Apr 03 21:13:43 <aidalgol>	I wanted to like Thief, but the AI was too stupid to be fun.
Apr 03 21:13:46 <white_magic>	roadie: also, fun fact: FC1 was intended as a graphics demo for nvidia geforce3 or something. Then they decided they could also make a game out of it
Apr 03 21:14:04 <white_magic>	aidalgol: true, the story was meh but the environment was soooo immersive
Apr 03 21:14:06 <roadie>	I only played FarCry Crysis HalfLife and Doom3 and made levels for halflife and crysis
Apr 03 21:14:33 <aidalgol>	I think I enjoyed Opposing Force more than Half-Life itself.
Apr 03 21:14:42 <white_magic>	OpFor was incredible, for sure
Apr 03 21:14:45 <aidalgol>	More interesting weapons and better levels.
Apr 03 21:14:52 <white_magic>	but so was HL1.. they're very different
Apr 03 21:14:54 <aidalgol>	HL draaaaags a lot.
Apr 03 21:14:57 <roadie>	white_magic: that is correct - they went to las vegas with their last bucks and pressured nvidia to play their demo when GDC was near to closing time - the rest is history
Apr 03 21:14:59 <aidalgol>	Same with HL2.
Apr 03 21:15:08 <white_magic>	aidalgol: the xen worlds were lame AF in HL1
Apr 03 21:15:18 <aidalgol>	I do want to play Black Mesa, though.
Apr 03 21:15:31 <roadie>	Black Mesa has a nice website
Apr 03 21:15:33 <white_magic>	yea they just finished the xen worlds in BM
Apr 03 21:15:38 <aidalgol>	I think I enjoy shooters like Half-Life more than chaotic DOOM-like FPS.
Apr 03 21:15:48 <white_magic>	the last time i played BM was in like 2012.. so it took them 8 years to finish the xen worlds
Apr 03 21:16:01 <lxbarbosa>	Dr Fauci just said that "we aint even on halftime", while politicians are saying by the end of April we'll be ready to return to work. 
Apr 03 21:16:10 <roadie>	probably a few germans on the team
Apr 03 21:16:11 <white_magic>	aidalgol: me too.. the arcadey shooters are a bit much for me.. but i used to be into them once upon a time
Apr 03 21:16:29 <aidalgol>	roadie: What makes you say that?
Apr 03 21:16:34 <white_magic>	lxbarbosa: please, spare us.. this is our refuge from reality!
Apr 03 21:17:17 <roadie>	aidalgol: black mesa team
Apr 03 21:17:18 <roadie>	perfectionists
Apr 03 21:17:18 <white_magic>	speaking of Xen
Apr 03 21:17:23 <white_magic>	soo anyone played HL Alyx?
Apr 03 21:17:27 <roadie>	nope
Apr 03 21:17:33 <white_magic>	me neither.. 
Apr 03 21:17:36 <ldlework>	Only a few minutes so far
Apr 03 21:17:38 <white_magic>	wonder if it's playable without VR gear
Apr 03 21:17:54 <roadie>	I watched it and it is painful to see that god tier level design wasted on that story and dialog 
Apr 03 21:18:05 <aidalgol>	white_magic: nope
Apr 03 21:18:30 <white_magic>	i wanna wait till more VR games come out before i buy a new GPU cuz I'm pretty sure my gtx 1060 won't cut it
Apr 03 21:18:33 <aidalgol>	(to the second question)
Apr 03 21:18:43 <aidalgol>	I *think* my 1070 may cut it?
Apr 03 21:18:51 <aidalgol>	But I really don't want to gear up to play games.
Apr 03 21:19:00 <aidalgol>	So I don't think I'll ever get into VR gaming.
Apr 03 21:19:13 <roadie>	me neither - I am too old for that shit
Apr 03 21:19:14 <white_magic>	aidalgol: well they kinda make games to sell hardware half the time :D
Apr 03 21:19:23 <aidalgol>	Most of my favourites are third-person.
Apr 03 21:19:38 <roadie>	tombraider was my first 
Apr 03 21:19:38 <aidalgol>	white_magic: This is probably a large part of why most of the games I play these days are indies.
Apr 03 21:19:48 <white_magic>	aidalgol: i have seen NVidia RTX 2080 mentioned a lot so it seems like that GPU is the one to have for good perf vs quality
Apr 03 21:20:19 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Or you're just seeing posts from gamers who always want the top-tier shit.
Apr 03 21:20:20 <white_magic>	i wanna get into VR gaming because it could be an excuse to exercise :D
Apr 03 21:20:26 <roadie>	I have a 10 year old radeon jetenginenoiselevel card - good enough
Apr 03 21:20:49 <aidalgol>	I have a gtx 1070.  I'm holding onto that for quite a while.
Apr 03 21:20:55 <white_magic>	yea i hate having to upgrade hw so it may be years before i played HL Alyx 
Apr 03 21:21:13 <aidalgol>	The last game that made me upgrade was The Witcher 3.
Apr 03 21:21:14 <white_magic>	the benefit of playing games years later is that all the bugs are ironed out and perf is optimal
Apr 03 21:21:37 <white_magic>	aidalgol: that's a good game to upgrade for. I've heard so many people say that that game is perhaps the best RPG they ever played
Apr 03 21:21:37 <aidalgol>	white_magic: And all the questions have been asked on forums for you.
Apr 03 21:21:45 <white_magic>	that too
Apr 03 21:21:47 <roadie>	I have been playing crysis 1 since 2009
Apr 03 21:21:55 <aidalgol>	white_magic: Ehh, it's more a story-driven ARPG.
Apr 03 21:22:02 <roadie>	I got all the bugs ironed out
Apr 03 21:22:17 <aidalgol>	BTW, if any of you like story-driven games, I highly recommend Iconoclasts.
Apr 03 21:22:33 <roadie>	story and game ... in one sentence?
Apr 03 21:22:42 <white_magic>	as for me, i'm waiting for the next Bioshocks and Mass Effects.. super immersive games with incredible stories. Sadly, such games are so rare.
Apr 03 21:22:48 <aidalgol>	I think it marries storytelling and gameplay well, especially for a platformer.
Apr 03 21:22:55 <aidalgol>	Oh god, I hated Bioshock.
Apr 03 21:23:02 <white_magic>	why?
Apr 03 21:23:03 <fsbot>	why not?
Apr 03 21:23:32 <aidalgol>	The storytelling was lame, and the gameplay was bad.
Apr 03 21:23:49 <roadie>	oh, right - I meant plot not story
Apr 03 21:23:53 <white_magic>	gameplay was .. ok.. not bad.. but the env was so immersive..
Apr 03 21:23:57 <white_magic>	story was not bad
Apr 03 21:24:07 <aidalgol>	Most of the exposition was in audio logs.  I hate audio logs.
Apr 03 21:24:12 <ldlework>	aidalgol: I'm with you on it being overrated.
Apr 03 21:24:16 <white_magic>	oh yea i started skipping most of the audio logs
Apr 03 21:24:31 <spudpnds>	My gaming box is still on Windows 7. I haven't booted it in 6 months, because ... windows 7, and I don't want to deal with Windows 10.
Apr 03 21:24:31 <aidalgol>	Why have these characters left tape recorders lying around, in just the right order, too?
Apr 03 21:24:34 <roadie>	I like audio logs in moderate amounts
Apr 03 21:24:41 <aidalgol>	spudpnds: Switch to Wine! :P
Apr 03 21:24:41 <roadie>	anything too much - no good
Apr 03 21:24:43 <white_magic>	i mean to me, just the sound design in Bioshock puts it in a category of its own

Apr 03 23:41:22 <johnjay>	ok i improved it slightly
Apr 03 23:41:35 <johnjay>	this does what I mentioned. moves line up or down, with prefix arg moves it that many lines
Apr 03 23:41:37 <johnjay>	https://dpaste.org/sJyM
Apr 03 23:44:30 <miskatonic>	rpav = remotely piloted aerial vehicles
Apr 03 23:45:22 <rpav>	i've definitely been called worse
Apr 03 23:45:35 <rpav>	i feel like that's from an old nick/acronym expander though
Apr 03 23:48:10 <miskatonic>	There seems to be a language named J which is similar to API but no weird characters
Apr 03 23:48:35 <refusenick>	miskatonic: Believe me, the weird characters help.
Apr 03 23:49:09 <fengshaun>	how do I set the PATH env var that tramp should use with a remote host?
Apr 03 23:49:34 <fengshaun>	setting tramp-remote-path and tramp-remote-process-environment's ENV doesn't do the trick
Apr 03 23:49:43 <fengshaun>	I still get command not found
Apr 03 23:49:46 <refusenick>	J's fast, but APL can be faster: https://github.com/Co-dfns/Co-dfns
Apr 03 23:51:05 <refusenick>	I really like J's functional (real functional like Backus meant, not fake functional like lambdas) aspects because it's more like math, but pointfree really is hard to read. Adding back symbols to J helps, though.
Apr 03 23:51:52 <rpav>	"fake functional like lambdas"? ;)
Apr 03 23:52:43 <rpav>	"function-level programming", different thing
Apr 03 23:53:32 <refusenick>	rpav: The whole point of "functional programming" is to impart algebraic clarity on programs. Lambdas + recursion don't necessarily do that.
Apr 03 23:53:56 <refusenick>	Until proven otherwise, I'm calling it fake-functional because it misses the point.
Apr 03 23:54:13 <rpav>	i've always understood functional programming to be directly derived from the lambda calculus, Church's work, etc
Apr 03 23:54:49 <refusenick>	Functional programming's motivation is to make programming no different from composing and applying functions in math.
Apr 03 23:55:43 <rpav>	kinda, i mean ... the lambda calculus *is* math, FP deriving from that and being mathematical definitely makes sense, i mean, definitionally
Apr 03 23:55:44 <refusenick>	Removing the shroud of high-falutin terminology like "System F-omega", where's the clarity?
Apr 03 23:55:50 <rpav>	i have never really been a fan of FP personally
Apr 03 23:55:58 <refusenick>	*which kind*
Apr 03 23:56:21 <rpav>	*functional programming*, not Backus's "function-level programming" which .. i'm not sure what it is yet, still reading
Apr 03 23:56:56 <rpav>	i've always found FP seems to have a lot of really clever solutions to problems that only exist because of FP
Apr 03 23:56:57 <refusenick>	http://www.csc.villanova.edu/~beck/csc8310/BackusFP.pdf
Apr 03 23:57:15 <rpav>	cool, the wikipedia page is definitely not getting to the heart of the matter
Apr 03 23:57:49 <refusenick>	rpav: Lambda calculus isn't used in math. It's a logician's construction. Nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't resemble anything from algebra or analysis.

Apr 04 12:07:25 <jfb4>	question: in compilation-mode or grep-mode, cycling through errors or matches opens a number of buffers, is there a way to automatically close them as you keep looking for results?
Apr 04 12:27:11 <roadie>	is there any way to run a file through uniq without changing the order of the lines? I have a 174MB that reduces to 37MB when sorted and 'uniqed' but then a lot of sense is lost ...
Apr 04 12:53:47 <roadie>	nvm
Apr 04 13:09:32 <andinus>	roadie: how did you solve it?
Apr 04 13:14:39 <grift>	there seems to be an inaccuracy in https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rmail-Inbox.html
Apr 04 13:15:08 <grift>	it does not seems to use ".newmail-NAME" but instead if uses "tmpXXXXXX"
Apr 04 13:15:44 <grift>	i guess that might have changed over time but that docs might not have been adjusted to reflect the new
Apr 04 13:16:24 <grift>	there shouldnt be a need for that random name though as its in ~
Apr 04 13:16:43 <grift>	and having a predictable name has its advantages
Apr 04 13:24:57 <roadie>	andinus: I did not - is it doable? 
Apr 04 13:28:49 <roadie>	grift: how do you know?
Apr 04 13:30:03 <grift>	auditing
Apr 04 13:30:32 <andinus>	roadie: if the order is a pattern then you can pipe it to sort
Apr 04 13:30:37 <grift>	but i might have a solution to the issue i was trying to solve (not sure yet)
Apr 04 13:30:48 <grift>	you can define rmail-file-name
Apr 04 13:31:18 <grift>	if i set that to something in a predicably named dir then i can rely on it
Apr 04 13:32:10 <grift>	ie ~/RMAIL/RMAIL
Apr 04 13:32:30 <grift>	but something says that it creates a backup in "~/RMAIL~"
Apr 04 13:32:42 <grift>	and if thats true than that would defeat the purpose
Apr 04 13:37:30 <grift>	yes rmail-file-name solves my issue, it doesnt doesnt create a backup ~/RMAIL~
Apr 04 13:39:26 <roadie>	that is set to ~/RMAIL here, yup
Apr 04 13:39:33 <parsnip>	roadie: M-x delete-duplicate-lines works here

Apr 04 14:04:45 <dustfinger>	Is there a way to specify the TERM used by serial-term for a specific session? I am connecting to a device using vt100, but vt100 is not a valid termcap for the device I am connecting to.
Apr 04 14:05:18 <codingquark>	Investing why my laptop disconnects from znc again and again
Apr 04 14:08:17 <isBEKaml>	dustfinger: I don't use term-mode or serial-term, but I suspect it's just an env var. so, use setenv?
Apr 04 14:08:55 <codingquark>	Looks like pathetic RF drivers are causing the connection to drop.
Apr 04 14:08:57 <codingquark>	Oh fuck it.
Apr 04 14:09:09 <dustfinger>	Yah, I can change it with setenv, but that would set it for the entire emacs session, what if I want one buffer to use TERM=linux and another to use TERM=dummy?
Apr 04 14:09:28 <dustfinger>	I will experiment. Maybe it will just work.
Apr 04 14:10:04 <expert975>	My terminal emulator changes themes with a key press. Some emacs face colors adapt to the new theme, such as background and foreground, but others, such as strings and function names, don't. Is there a way to set faces to follow the current terminal theme?
Apr 04 14:10:53 <dustfinger>	nm. the $TERM environmentn variable from emacs has nothing to do with the device defaulting to vt100.

Apr 04 22:11:12 <wrycode>	oh I found it, it's in his workflow.org file
Apr 04 22:38:07 <jfb4>	a question: in compilation-mode or grep-mode, cycling through errors or
Apr 04 22:38:08 <jfb4>	       matches opens a number of buffers, is there a way to automatically
Apr 04 22:38:08 <jfb4>	       close them as you keep looking for results?
Apr 04 22:45:06 <dale>	jfb4: I have never seen anything like that.  I'm kind of interested to know if you find something, though.
Apr 04 22:46:18 <dale>	For writing something super-general to do that, I guess you could hook into buffer-list-update-hook to notice what command has just created a buffer.  Then something like pre-command-hook/post-command-hook to notice if you're doing the same command over and over.
Apr 04 22:47:10 <dale>	Alternatively maybe you could do something like recording in each buffer what command caused the buffer to be created, then a timer that will kill the buffer after N seconds if no other command has caused the buffer to be activated.
Apr 04 22:47:32 <dale>	Less generally I assume you could just wrap next-error and do... something.
Apr 04 22:48:46 <shrysr>	wrycode: i've been finding helm-swoop to be helpful for writing longer programs with org documents.
Apr 04 22:54:59 <shrysr>	bremner: howddya mean combining multiple files? Curious to know if you have any tricks/tips for that in general. For example, tangle different sets of headings to different directories apparently can work if the directory is specified via elisp? Doesnt work as one would expect with the :dir header-argument.

Apr 04 23:44:13 <dale>	wrycode: Actually, maybe variable org-clock-heading is even better for your purposes.  Here's how I put the task name in the tooltip indicator for being clocked in on my mode line: https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/master/init.el#L2612
Apr 04 23:44:35 <wrycode>	sort of but I'm using a custom modeline with powerline so I'm not sure how to put that back in the mode line 
Apr 04 23:45:19 <wrycode>	oh shoot org-clock-heading is literally exactly what I want
Apr 04 23:45:25 <dale>	I don't know if org-clock-heading gets cleared after you clock out or not.  If so you could probably easily save it off into a file, if you really want to know the last clocked task.
Apr 04 23:45:48 <wrycode>	it shows the most recent task, and I can use org-clocking-p to display the clock status
Apr 04 23:45:50 <dale>	org-clock-out-hook could do that, for example.
Apr 04 23:50:02 <wrycode>	dale: I'll try it with a conditional in the mode-line-format which is easier to write. If it's too slow I'll use org-clock-out/in-hook. Thanks for pointing out org-clock-heading, I didn't see it at all

Apr 04 23:53:15 <bremner>	shrysr: basically I want to re-use functions in multiple org files, for export and tangle
Apr 04 23:54:01 <bremner>	shrysr: the only method I have so far is # Local Variables: \n# eval: (org-babel-lob-ingest "lecture21.org")\n# End:
Apr 05 00:00:14 <shrysr>	bremner: yea. i am not aware of anything other than lob and local variables to do this.. but then i discover new stuff every other day.
Apr 05 00:00:29 <shrysr>	bremner: i wonder if projectile based .dir-locals.el would help tho. Currently experimenting with that for python environments. Would still probably mean lob ingesting, but could be easier to handle as a single file catering to many? 
Apr 05 00:01:50 <bremner>	I'm not sure. I have multiple "projects" in one directory, so...
Apr 05 00:27:00 <shrysr>	wrycode: not sure about that. i have not used isearch much. helm-swoop appears to limit searches to source blocks or headers depending on where you start / filter...also has a buncha other nifty functions. I've also been using hippie-expand for variable names..

Apr 10 10:02:34 <aidalgol>	Man, I want to add to my `shackle-rules' for the first time in almost four years, and I've completely forgotten the interface.
Apr 10 10:02:49 <aidalgol>	Is this the inverse of code entropy?
Apr 10 10:03:26 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 10 10:03:35 <wasamasa>	has it been that long?
Apr 10 10:03:47 <aidalgol>	It has.  I checked with git blame
Apr 10 10:03:54 <aidalgol>	(on my config, not on shackle)
Apr 10 10:05:09 <wasamasa>	wow, I really did create it six years ago
Apr 10 10:05:31 <wasamasa>	IIRC you were the one who made me devise a EBNF grammar
Apr 10 10:06:39 <aidalgol>	Yeah, that's actually pretty good in combination with the English explanations above.
Apr 10 10:06:53 <wasamasa>	I wonder whether it was helpful for anyone else than you :D
Apr 10 10:06:59 <aidalgol>	I still plead Sgt Schultz.
Apr 10 10:09:23 <aidalgol>	OK, that joke might not translate well...
Apr 10 10:10:23 <wasamasa>	the three monkeys?
Apr 10 10:10:33 <aidalgol>	Hogan's Heroes.
Apr 10 10:11:24 <aidalgol>	Schultz was always trying to avoid responsibility by saying "I hear nothing. I see nothing!" when witnessing or overhearing the plotting of the prisoners he was supposed to be keeping watch on.
Apr 10 10:11:40 <wasamasa>	see/hear/speak no evil
Apr 10 10:12:02 <aidalgol>	This was more feigning ignorance.
Apr 10 10:15:14 <aidalgol>	Hmm, ("*inferior-lisp*" :ignore t) works as expected, but ("*inferior-lisp*" :other t) does not.  Instead, it behaves as ("*inferior-lisp*" :same t) should.
Apr 10 10:16:01 <wasamasa>	this :other/:same thing is super limited
Apr 10 10:19:02 <faceface>	hihi
Apr 10 10:19:09 <faceface>	Ctrl-x Ctrl-c isn't working 
Apr 10 10:19:19 <faceface>	The term seems broken somehow
Apr 10 10:19:32 <faceface>	I had to manually set TERM=xterm

Apr 10 10:20:49 <wasamasa>	kill-emacs skips the saving part
Apr 10 10:21:00 <faceface>	k, I'm saved
Apr 10 10:21:29 <aidalgol>	Is there something else I could use to achieve the same effect, just for `run-lisp'?
Apr 10 10:21:53 <wasamasa>	it uses `pop-to-buffer-same-window'
Apr 10 10:22:17 <aidalgol>	IIRC, geiser opens the REPL buffer in a separate window, whereas run-lisp opens its buffer in the current window.
Apr 10 10:22:20 <aidalgol>	Which is super annoying.
Apr 10 10:24:34 <wasamasa>	wait, what if you try :popup
Apr 10 10:24:45 <wasamasa>	does that do it?
Apr 10 10:25:04 <aidalgol>	Same behaviour.
Apr 10 10:26:47 <wasamasa>	weird, with :popup t I get the lisp buffer in a new window
Apr 10 10:26:53 <wasamasa>	or isn't that what you wanted?
Apr 10 10:27:07 <faceface>	thanks again
Apr 10 10:28:02 <aidalgol>	That's what I want, but not what I'm getting.
Apr 10 10:28:17 <aidalgol>	I don't need to disable then re-enable shackle-mode after setting shackle-rules, do I?
Apr 10 10:29:26 <wasamasa>	nah
Apr 10 10:29:39 <wasamasa>	try with a minimal config
Apr 10 10:33:55 <aidalgol>	OK, I just tried with emacs -q with only shackle loaded, and I get the exact same behaviour.
Apr 10 10:34:10 <aidalgol>	I'm running Emacs 26.1 from Debian.
Apr 10 10:34:13 <wasamasa>	I mean, a minimal set of rules
Apr 10 10:34:21 <aidalgol>	And just that one rule.
Apr 10 10:34:30 <wasamasa>	what is the rule?
Apr 10 10:34:31 <fsbot>	rule is For a horizontal bar/line on the page, do !l Some text \\ \rule{\textwidth}{1pt} \\ Some more text. The width can be given instead of \emph{1pt}.
Apr 10 10:34:38 <aidalgol>	("*inferior-lisp*" :popup t)
Apr 10 10:34:42 <aidalgol>	or ("*inferior-lisp*" :other t)
Apr 10 10:34:47 <wasamasa>	try inferior-lisp-mode
Apr 10 10:34:50 <aidalgol>	,shoot fsbot 
Apr 10 10:34:50 *	fsbot loads its neural lace and wires aidalgol up to the console as a shell.
Apr 10 10:35:11 <aidalgol>	AAAAHHH!!!!
Apr 10 10:35:16 <wasamasa>	yeah, I know
Apr 10 10:35:59 <aidalgol>	no. no joy.
Apr 10 10:36:27 <wasamasa>	I must be doing something wrong
Apr 10 10:38:13 <aidalgol>	Where in shackle.el should I start step-through debugging?
Apr 10 10:38:38 <wasamasa>	http://ix.io/2hqG
Apr 10 10:38:49 <wasamasa>	this is a minimal init file I cannot reproduce the issue with
Apr 10 10:39:05 <wasamasa>	it splits the current window into two
Apr 10 10:40:01 <wasamasa>	this is on emacs 26.3
Apr 10 10:40:17 <wasamasa>	try emacs -Q -l test.el
Apr 10 10:40:33 <wasamasa>	and don't forget adjusting the path to shackle :P
Apr 10 10:41:04 <aidalgol>	Is it OK if it's an elpa directory from my main emacs config?
Apr 10 10:41:09 <wasamasa>	sure
Apr 10 10:41:26 <wasamasa>	you could even try to avoid it by using package-initialize
Apr 10 10:41:35 <aidalgol>	oh yeah, I'm using shackle 1.0.3
Apr 10 10:41:58 <wasamasa>	wow, me too
Apr 10 10:58:39 <wasamasa>	so, how do your tests go?
Apr 10 10:59:07 <mixfix411>	asdffsff
Apr 10 10:59:40 <wasamasa>	not sure whether mixfix411 is a badly programmed bot or clueless person
Apr 10 11:00:09 <mixfix411>	casdasdasd
Apr 10 11:05:53 <wasamasa>	ok, a 9-year-old
Apr 10 11:29:39 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: OK, that worked.
Apr 10 11:29:44 <aidalgol>	(sorry, got waylaid)
Apr 10 11:29:52 <wasamasa>	you what?
Apr 10 11:30:00 <aidalgol>	dragged away
Apr 10 11:32:44 <wasamasa>	well, if the snippet works, then it must be something in your init file
Apr 10 11:33:07 <aidalgol>	Uh, how do I use the bisect method when ELPA packages are part of my init?
Apr 10 11:33:53 <bpalmer>	mv away half of them.
Apr 10 11:34:00 <aidalgol>	ugh...
Apr 10 11:36:54 <aidalgol>	wtf is canlock?
Apr 10 11:49:36 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: This gets weirder: if I run emacs -l test.el with test.el containing just (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/racket") (call-interactively 'run-lisp), with my full, normal config, it works as expected.
Apr 10 11:50:17 <aidalgol>	Eval-ing that file, With that exact same config, it behaves incorrectly.

Apr 10 12:09:38 <aidalgol>	That's a minimal reproduction of the bug.
Apr 10 12:23:45 <wasamasa>	but why are you using :other?
Apr 10 12:30:00 <wasamasa>	anyway, the issue is that window--try-to-split-window fails creating a new one
Apr 10 12:30:50 <aidalgol>	I get the same behaviour as with :popup.
Apr 10 12:34:08 <wasamasa>	this happens because it calls split-window-sensibly (hahaha)
Apr 10 12:34:14 <wasamasa>	which considers the window unsplittable
Apr 10 12:34:36 <wasamasa>	ffs
Apr 10 12:36:04 <wasamasa>	for that it calls window-splittable-p which honors a few customizables
Apr 10 12:36:57 <wasamasa>	neither vertical nor horizontal split are deemed OK
Apr 10 12:38:47 <giorgian>	Hi. What does "assignment to free variable `some-variable'" means, exactly?
Apr 10 12:39:41 <wasamasa>	it means the variable hasn't been declared
Apr 10 12:40:18 <wasamasa>	assigning to an undeclared variable isn't something you should do in package code
Apr 10 12:41:48 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: the easy workaround is setting both `split-height-threshold' and `split-width-threshold' to a low number, like 0
Apr 10 12:42:06 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: this is what I do, hence why I've never run into your behavior
Apr 10 12:42:25 <giorgian>	So, should I stop splitting my emacs configuration in packages, or should I be sure to assign the variable after loading the package that defines it?
Apr 10 12:42:47 <giorgian>	(or both?)
Apr 10 12:42:51 <wasamasa>	your emacs configuration is not package code
Apr 10 12:43:09 <wasamasa>	it's above code quality checking
Apr 10 12:43:43 <wasamasa>	using a byte-compiler on it is overkill
Apr 10 12:44:00 <wasamasa>	honor these warnings when writing your own packages, otherwise they're useless
Apr 10 12:44:05 <giorgian>	should I use (load "my-file.el") to split my configuration into several files?
Apr 10 12:44:18 <wasamasa>	depends on what you want to do
Apr 10 12:44:50 <wasamasa>	I'd use load-file
Apr 10 12:45:05 <giorgian>	ok, thank you.
Apr 10 12:45:39 <wasamasa>	require assumes you want to load something identified by its feature name, which is mostly useful when writing packages
Apr 10 12:45:52 <wasamasa>	load-file assumes you want to load something identified by its path
Apr 10 12:45:57 <wasamasa>	load is used by both
Apr 10 12:46:11 <giorgian>	perfect, thank you.
Apr 10 12:46:31 <wasamasa>	while you can organize your init file like a package, it doesn't make much sense to do that and has side effects such as reloading not working
Apr 10 12:46:54 <giorgian>	oh, I wasn't aware of that, thank you
Apr 10 12:48:50 <giorgian>	Another question: my biggest problem in splitting my init.el file, right now, is the huge custom-set-variables block. Should I just stop using customize-variable, customize-group etc. forever and just use setq, or is there a way to use those functions and have them write in different files?
Apr 10 12:49:11 <wasamasa>	custom.el doesn't support multiple blocks
Apr 10 12:49:31 <wasamasa>	that's why many people forego it for everything it's not needed for
Apr 10 12:49:46 <giorgian>	excellent, thank you
Apr 10 12:49:50 <jamzattack>	(setq custom-file "wherever") at the beginning of your init file if it gets in your way
Apr 10 12:51:52 <jamzattack>	It's sometimes a good idea to put groups of related functions etc. into their own package that can be loaded with use-package or something though
Apr 10 12:53:36 <jamzattack>	e.g. https://0x0.st/iSWb.el
Apr 10 12:55:36 <giorgian>	jamzattack: I see, thank you
Apr 10 12:55:36 <giorgian>	 
Apr 10 13:02:20 <giorgian>	So, How do I tell flycheck that "some-file.el" is not a package?
Apr 10 13:03:05 <wasamasa>	simply by not enabling it for that buffer
Apr 10 13:03:39 <wasamasa>	enable it for buffers where you want it, not globally
Apr 10 13:04:10 <wasamasa>	for that you can use a hook that checks `buffer-file-name' before enabling it
Apr 10 13:04:56 <giorgian>	OK, thank you -- maybe I could do the opposite, have a list of filenames for which not to enable it
Apr 10 13:05:07 <wasamasa>	it's elisp, go wild
Apr 10 13:05:26 <wasamasa>	you have conditional forms, you have regex matching, ...
Apr 10 13:05:38 <bremner>	pcase!
Apr 10 13:06:08 <giorgian>	wasamasa: you're right, of course
Apr 10 13:06:58 <wasamasa>	I have a directory where all the packages I hack on are and check for it in such a hook
Apr 10 13:07:49 <giorgian>	Yes, that's what I was thinking, thank you
Apr 10 13:13:54 <giorgian>	Is there a way to have flycheck display the name of the rule alongside the message?
Apr 10 13:15:41 <wasamasa>	flycheck just displays whatever the checker figured out
Apr 10 13:15:49 <wasamasa>	if the checker uses rules, sure
Apr 10 13:15:56 <wasamasa>	but the byte-compiler doesn't have such a thing
Apr 10 13:25:04 <giorgian>	I was hoping to keep emacs-lisp while disabling (locally) emacs-lisp-checkdoc...
Apr 10 13:34:14 <wasamasa>	that's something else though
Apr 10 13:36:27 <wasamasa>	the emacs-lisp checker is configured to run the emacs-lisp-checkdoc checker next
Apr 10 13:36:27 <giorgian>	wasamasa: yes, sorry - initially I thought they were part of the same checker, it took me some grepping to find out. Also, I found my answer: a .dir-locals.el file in my ~/.emacs.d/config directory
Apr 10 13:37:44 <giorgian>	as described here https://www.flycheck.org/en/27/_downloads/flycheck.html

Apr 10 13:39:36 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: I like that emacs gives you the option to customize these thresholds, but it's still surprising when you're using a 23" screen, yet can't split a window in a frame

Apr 10 15:37:19 <quiliro>	haha
Apr 10 15:38:03 <bremner>	delay due to lab overwork
Apr 10 15:38:18 <mplsCorwin>	he lives!
Apr 10 15:38:50 <bremner>	who you calling alive?
Apr 10 15:38:55 <mplsCorwin>	Ack.  Got you confused with bandali again bremner.
Apr 10 15:39:00 <bremner>	ook
Apr 10 15:39:03 <mplsCorwin>	 lol
Apr 10 15:39:32 <cvandusen>	The resemblance is uncanny 
Apr 10 15:39:33 <bremner>	I've met bandali, so I'm relatively sure he's not me. Unlike bpalmer and rudybot
Apr 10 15:39:56 <quiliro>	Maybe he is you in another dimension!
Apr 10 15:40:05 <quiliro>	or in another reality
Apr 10 15:40:25 <cvandusen>	rudybot: reality, what a concept
Apr 10 15:40:36 <rudybot>	cvandusen: m4 is an interesting concept but a terrifying reality.
Apr 10 15:41:08 <cvandusen>	much like the baconator
Apr 10 15:41:32 <Plazma>	,baconator
Apr 10 15:41:35 <fsbot>	Not enough people play SKEE-BALL..  They're always thinking about COCAINE or and ALIEN BEINGS!!
Apr 10 15:41:44 <Plazma>	i like everything i just read within the past 10 seconds
Apr 10 15:41:58 <Plazma>	rudybot: baconator
Apr 10 15:41:59 <rudybot>	Plazma: much like the baconator
Apr 10 15:42:15 <highmemorydaemon>	What package does Spacemacs use to get that menu pop up when you hit spacebar?
Apr 10 15:42:28 <Plazma>	highmemorydaemon: helm maybe?
Apr 10 15:42:35 <Plazma>	or the other one
Apr 10 15:42:40 <cvandusen>	C-h k will tell the tale 
Apr 10 15:43:19 <highmemorydaemon>	cvandusen: I don't think I can because it is a map. Like it expects you to hit another key after spacebar.
Apr 10 15:43:39 <highmemorydaemon>	cantstanya: Ex. after hitting the spacebar you can hit ! to run a shell cmd
Apr 10 15:43:45 <cvandusen>	Then press C-h 
Apr 10 15:44:09 <bremner>	there's hydra, but I suspect spacemacs NIHs it.
Apr 10 15:44:18 <bremner>	,spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:19 <fsbot>	I think spacemacs is [0/6] A Emacs distribution centered around evil-mode, with the tag line "the best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and Vim"
Apr 10 15:44:19 <fsbot>	[1] at https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:20 <fsbot>	[2] support is available at https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs
Apr 10 15:44:20 <fsbot>	[3] has its own subreddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/spacemacs/ ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 15:44:24 <quiliro>	Plazma: you like: '("<Plazma>" "baconator," "<fsbot>" "Not" "enough" "people" "play" "SKEE-BALL.." "They're" "always" "thinking" "about"
Apr 10 15:44:25 <quiliro>		"COCAINE" "or" "and" "ALIEN" "BEINGS!!")
Apr 10 15:44:30 <cvandusen>	Though, the fact that spacemacs is overriding the spacebar is another selling point against it.
Apr 10 15:46:23 <highmemorydaemon>	cvandusen: I think it only does that if you select evil mode during setup. It's pretty intuitive in that case because what else would you use the spacebar for in normal mode in Vim editing.
Apr 10 15:46:49 <Plazma>	i use C-Space for my tmux setup, actually.. C-a and C-b would interfere with emacs bindings
Apr 10 15:46:58 <Plazma>	i got tied of hitting C-a C-a twice
Apr 10 15:49:39 <grym>	i settled on C-o 
Apr 10 15:49:57 <grym>	C-space opens Spotlight on some of my machines 
Apr 10 15:51:26 <Plazma>	grym: for tmux? you do a lot of emacs in the terminal?
Apr 10 15:51:49 <grym>	Plazma: C-o for tmux; i don't do a whole lot of emacs in terminal but do love readline bindings 
Apr 10 15:52:02 <Plazma>	readline bindings? 
Apr 10 15:54:40 <highmemorydaemon>	Ok, so I think it's using which-key
Apr 10 15:56:31 <grym>	Plazma: most shells use GNU readline at the prompt 
Apr 10 15:56:34 <grym>	which act like emacs 
Apr 10 15:56:37 <grym>	normally 
Apr 10 15:56:46 <Plazma>	ohhh
Apr 10 15:56:56 <grym>	ever wondered why C-a, C-k "work at the bash prompt"? readline is why 
Apr 10 15:57:06 <Plazma>	ah yes, i did
Apr 10 15:57:16 <Plazma>	it's like they planned it out or something
Apr 10 15:57:22 <grym>	funny thing 
Apr 10 15:57:42 <grym>	speaking of which: C-u is "kill backwards to start of line" in bash/readline -- what's this spelled like in emacs? 
Apr 10 15:59:17 <rpav>	you'd think there's be backward-kill-line, but no .. i write my own backward-delete-line (which i would have anyway, because adding to the kill ring i find annoying)
Apr 10 16:01:41 <ngz>	grym: It is `kill-line' with a 0 argument.
Apr 10 16:03:32 <rpav>	ah .. doesn't respect the visual line though
Apr 10 16:03:56 <grym>	rpav: what do you mean by visual line 
Apr 10 16:04:01 <wgreenhouse>	,,df kill-visual-line
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	kill-visual-line is an interactive compiled Lisp function in
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	‘simple.el’.
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	(kill-visual-line &optional ARG)
Apr 10 16:04:02 <fsbot>	Kill the rest of the visual line. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 16:04:06 <wgreenhouse>	^
Apr 10 16:04:06 <ngz>	rpav: Then use `kill-visual-line' with a 0 argument.
Apr 10 16:04:13 <wgreenhouse>	grym: soft wrapping
Apr 10 16:04:48 <Plazma>	,helm
Apr 10 16:04:49 <fsbot>	helm is [0] incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're looking for stuff in Emacs

Apr 10 16:04:49 <fsbot>	[2] unofficial tutorial: https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html
Apr 10 16:04:54 <grym>	wgreenhouse: ahha.  
Apr 10 16:04:56 <grym>	ok cool 
Apr 10 16:05:07 <wgreenhouse>	as in visual-line-mode
Apr 10 16:05:15 <grym>	and you can bind "a function with some prefix arguments" to a normal binding right 
Apr 10 16:05:30 <wgreenhouse>	(Not stellar naming even by Emacs standards)
Apr 10 16:05:36 <wgreenhouse>	grym: yep
Apr 10 16:05:54 <grym>	cool cool
Apr 10 16:06:00 <rpav>	visual-line is soft wrapping, yeah, and with adaptive-wrap-prefix is magical
Apr 10 16:06:39 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: if that works these days with heavy indent-using things like org-mode, I'm sokd
Apr 10 16:06:43 <wgreenhouse>	*sold
Apr 10 16:06:56 <rpav>	dunno, i don't even use org mode, i don't see the need
Apr 10 16:07:01 <wgreenhouse>	Tired of using emacs like a typewriter for natural language 
Apr 10 16:07:21 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: k, I'll ,,tias
Apr 10 16:07:22 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 10 16:07:48 <rpav>	(i'd be surprised if it didn't, unless org-mode already handles auto-indent/wrap on its own)
Apr 10 16:08:19 <ngz>	wgreenhouse: what is heavy indent-using in Org? I only see plain lists. Any other indentation is optional.
Apr 10 16:09:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ngz: Perhaps they enable the optional indent mode.
Apr 10 16:10:36 <wgreenhouse>	ngz: paragraphs. I use org to author docs with lots of subheadings
Apr 10 16:10:40 <Twist>	org has an indent startup option
Apr 10 16:10:52 <ngz>	Paragraphs do not need to be indented, do they?
Apr 10 16:10:57 <wgreenhouse>	Traditionally this looked terrible in visual-line-mode
Apr 10 16:11:02 <wgreenhouse>	No but I want them to be
Apr 10 16:11:13 <Twist>	oddly, this seems to have become the default somwehere along the line.. I just noticed I'm not specfying indent on my fedora box, and it's enabled
Apr 10 16:11:45 <wgreenhouse>	it may also depend on whether you use electric indent globally 
Apr 10 16:11:52 <wgreenhouse>	(I do_
Apr 10 16:11:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I heavily use sub-headings, so it annoys me far too much to use it.
Apr 10 16:12:00 <rpav>	what looks terrible in vlm+org mode? it doesn't indent the paragraph body?
Apr 10 16:12:02 <ngz>	I think a sane change is to set `org-adapt-indentation' to nil.
Apr 10 16:12:14 <Twist>	wgreenhouse: I don't suppose you've found a usable wrapping solution for org tables?
Apr 10 16:12:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	There's no way I can imagine of sanely wrapping tables.
Apr 10 16:12:46 <rpav>	wrapping tables doesn't make any sense
Apr 10 16:12:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	^
Apr 10 16:13:09 <Twist>	You'd need word wrap in individual cells.
Apr 10 16:13:12 <rpav>	i mean unless you print them, roll them up, and put them in a package, or something ;)
Apr 10 16:13:30 <rpav>	i think at that point org-mode is probably not the tool for the job
Apr 10 16:13:35 <Twist>	Excel certainly manages.
Apr 10 16:13:44 <mplsCorwin>	A (better) solution for table cells containing multi-line and paragraph content would be cool.
Apr 10 16:14:07 <ngz>	There's `org-table-wrap-region'.
Apr 10 16:14:14 *	Twist googles
Apr 10 16:15:03 <ngz>	It is a strange beast, tho.
Apr 10 16:15:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Excel doesn't afaik. It simply scrolls out of sccreen.
Apr 10 16:15:16 <Twist>	That appers to insert a manual linebreak into a cell, if I'm reading correctly
Apr 10 16:15:33 <Twist>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: you can enable wrapping within cells.
Apr 10 16:15:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Unless you mean per-cell wrapping.
Apr 10 16:15:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah
Apr 10 16:16:03 <Twist>	ANd you can select columns or the entire sheet to quickly and broadly apply the attribute
Apr 10 16:16:31 <mplsCorwin>	Eipes. "If you formatted it to more lines than it was before, fields further down in the table get overwritten"
Apr 10 16:17:02 <Twist>	I admit my use case is wierd. I'm using org babel with sql server.
Apr 10 16:17:15 <Twist>	The result sets return as tables, and of course are sometimes very wide
Apr 10 16:17:18 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: correct, paragraph body not indented 
Apr 10 16:17:43 <Twist>	So I wind up having to toggle wrap on and off depending on whether I'm working in prose or with the result set.
Apr 10 16:17:45 <rpav>	wgreenhouse: yeah the adaptive wrap prefix should definitely solve that
Apr 10 16:19:20 <mplsCorwin>	Twist: what about iteratively breaking down your big table into more human facing structures e.g. with calc/formulas?  Maybe the "raw" data table can be hidden or deemphasized in the output document.
Apr 10 16:20:25 <Twist>	Manual display formatting has rapidly diminshing returns. 
Apr 10 16:20:54 <mplsCorwin>	Right, but writing code to turn big ones into little ones is a time honored method of creating useful human facing reportage.
Apr 10 16:22:04 <mplsCorwin>	In any case, sorry if that's the wrong direction.  Luck.
Apr 10 16:22:07 <Twist>	I'm doing sysadmin work, not creating reports for downstream consumption. 
Apr 10 16:22:46 <Twist>	So the only real problem is my own allergic reaction to hscroll.
Apr 10 16:24:36 <rpav>	let's make everything diagonal, to maximize horizontal space
Apr 10 16:25:00 <ngz>	Note that you can narrow an Org column
Apr 10 16:25:09 <mplsCorwin>	Won't work.  Too many of us are crooked.
Apr 10 16:25:32 <Twist>	ngz: doesn't that truncate rather than wrap?
Apr 10 16:26:06 <ngz>	Twist: That truncates, yes. It is useful to hide boring stuff and keep row short enough.
Apr 10 16:26:23 <mplsCorwin>	I wonder if items + column view mode would be better than tables...
Apr 10 16:26:46 <Twist>	My lowbrow solution is just to html export and pop it open in a browser, where tables behave like this by default.
Apr 10 16:27:45 <rpav>	yeah i just typically type markdown-ish files with lots of indentation myself .. if i ever really, really care about how it looks formatted, i'll format it
Apr 10 16:28:11 <rpav>	and not even like some markdown-mode, just good ol' text-mode
Apr 10 16:28:19 <Twist>	But visual-line-mode looks like garbage with wide tables. You essentially have to ignore the region.
Apr 10 16:28:37 <Twist>	It'd also be nice if tables just didn't wrap
Apr 10 16:28:47 <rpav>	yeah i dunno what to do if you need a lot of tables... it actually annoys me a bit there's not a good format for importing data that's also relatively simple
Apr 10 16:29:26 <quiliro>	Talking about tables, what do you recommend for handling the following situation for me. I need to make a list of products I buy ...those products have several producers....those producers have contact information.
Apr 10 16:29:44 <rpav>	it's too bad visual-line-mode can't stop wrapping around certain markers, or something
Apr 10 16:30:08 <Twist>	Some sort of soft wrap that isn't the actual document width
Apr 10 16:30:22 <rpav>	quiliro: how many?
Apr 10 16:30:36 <quiliro>	Right now i have a list of the products with the names of the producers and contact details repeating for producers of multiple products
Apr 10 16:30:57 <rpav>	sounds like a job for a database with any realistic number of records
Apr 10 16:31:01 <quiliro>	and also I would have to repeat a product if there are several producers of the same product
Apr 10 16:31:04 <Twist>	quiliro: Did this just turn into a relational database normalization question?
Apr 10 16:31:13 <quiliro>	2000 products
Apr 10 16:31:20 <rpav>	database :p
Apr 10 16:31:38 <quiliro>	nosql?
Apr 10 16:31:40 <fsbot>	[->] mongodb is [0] an open source document-oriented nosql database ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 10 16:31:58 <rpav>	i wouldn't use nosql for anything that wasn't specifically freeform-document-oriented.. and maybe even then
Apr 10 16:32:03 <Twist>	or sqlite 
Apr 10 16:32:35 <Twist>	Sure, there are better DBs.. but sqlite has pretty low startup cost.
Apr 10 16:32:39 <rpav>	then it's a matter of "how important is your data and who's using it," which ranges from "sqlite" (not very, me) to "postgres" (very, a lot of people)
Apr 10 16:33:04 <rpav>	actually i'm not sure there's much in between either
Apr 10 16:33:24 <Twist>	access. :D
Apr 10 16:33:27 <quiliro>	it is just me
Apr 10 16:33:41 <quiliro>	I heard about BBDB
Apr 10 16:33:52 <Twist>	Actually, doesn't libreoffce have a db module?
Apr 10 16:33:59 <rpav>	ah, i didn't consider negative space .. "my data needs destroyed, and not even i am using it"
Apr 10 16:34:07 <Twist>	haha
Apr 10 16:34:23 <quiliro>	negative space?
Apr 10 16:34:32 <rpav>	sqlite is a really solid option unless you're trying for distributing or big backups
Apr 10 16:34:56 <quiliro>	I woooould not use LO...rather something that works with Emacs
Apr 10 16:34:59 <rpav>	it's not unreliable, it's just i think the options for backup and restore might be slightly more limited
Apr 10 16:35:12 <Twist>	quiliro: are you already using org mode?
Apr 10 16:35:17 <quiliro>	yes
Apr 10 16:35:26 <Twist>	quiliro: how about org babel?
Apr 10 16:35:38 <mplsCorwin>	My $.02. I'd probably just go with seperate org docs for each product, or maybe sections, and writing my own queries with org-ql or some such.  Nothing wrong with an RDBMS here, but probably overkill and having narratives around each product that you don't have think about data-modeling for may be more useful vs faster queries you don't have to plumb.
Apr 10 16:35:39 <quiliro>	I am using a table on org-mode
Apr 10 16:35:49 <Twist>	quiliro: Not for long.
Apr 10 16:36:11 <rpav>	mplsCorwin: yeah that would work .. or like, a wiki-esque setup
Apr 10 16:36:13 <rpav>	if it's all just descriptive
Apr 10 16:36:20 <quiliro>	I only have 200 products now
Apr 10 16:36:33 <quiliro>	but it will get to about 200
Apr 10 16:36:34 <quiliro>	2000
Apr 10 16:36:40 <rpav>	does org-mode act as a wiki? i.e. pages that can trivially link to others by name?
Apr 10 16:37:19 <mplsCorwin>	quiliro: I think the number of starting products is more vial then the potential size of the pool assuming you will personally do all data entry.  If you started with 2k I'd def write something to import, at which an RDBMS may be more attractive (e.g. to be able to use existing loader tools).
Apr 10 16:37:23 <quiliro>	is there an example of a database constructed with one product per file?
Apr 10 16:37:24 <grym>	rpav: you can do this, sure
Apr 10 16:38:29 <mplsCorwin>	there's a gnu project that has some emacs support for flat-file DB.  I forget the name but it handles relationships and semi structured data pretty reasonably and has query semantics already developed.
Apr 10 16:39:04 <quiliro>	so I have one product per file which contains links with the names of all providers of that product and each provider can have its own file with its contact details
Apr 10 16:39:12 <rpav>	you could just spit out org-mode whatever too if that suits you .. if you just want descriptions+link-to-producer/etc you wouldn't have much redundant data that way
Apr 10 16:39:21 <rpav>	or some other wiki format
Apr 10 16:39:28 <Twist>	quiliro: Those who fail to learn SQL are doomed to reimplement it. Poorly.
Apr 10 16:39:34 <mplsCorwin>	Recutils, I'm thinking of.
Apr 10 16:39:51 <quiliro>	I have used sql
Apr 10 16:39:57 <rpav>	i think the main question is how you want to consume the data
Apr 10 16:40:02 <quiliro>	but never on production
Apr 10 16:40:32 <mplsCorwin>	unless it's how you want to edit the data.  decided which of those is more driving is a great first step.
Apr 10 16:40:50 <grym>	mplsCorwin: recutils seems super interesting 
Apr 10 16:40:50 <rpav>	nah, because an editor is just a data consumer
Apr 10 16:41:03 <mplsCorwin>	rpav: ok, I can see that
Apr 10 16:41:04 <grym>	rpav: org-roam and org-brain are both other ways to do mappings like this 
Apr 10 16:41:08 <rpav>	but if you want to write other things that use/process the data, you're stuck 
Apr 10 16:41:18 <mplsCorwin>	org-brain is a pretty interesting suggestion
Apr 10 16:41:23 <grym>	and org-rifle if you tag stuff rigorously 
Apr 10 16:41:34 <quiliro>	I would like to have a report that tells me which are the providers of a certain product and be able to get hold of their contact details....and to make a lis of all the products I can buy from a certain provider
Apr 10 16:41:38 <rpav>	grym: sure probably
Apr 10 16:41:42 <rpav>	i'm not really an org-mode fan
Apr 10 16:41:50 <grym>	it's how i do my notes 
Apr 10 16:41:54 <grym>	but i have yet to cult further
Apr 10 16:42:26 <rpav>	reporting sounds the the job for a db ;/
Apr 10 16:42:45 <quiliro>	oh....because of select *
Apr 10 16:42:48 <rpav>	otherwise, you end up hacking a db on top of a not-db, when you could more easily go the other way
Apr 10 16:42:52 <quiliro>	from *
Apr 10 16:42:55 <quiliro>	in *
Apr 10 16:43:01 <Twist>	quiliro: you can use org-babel with several DB back ends.
Apr 10 16:43:16 <Twist>	quiliro: Run a query in a code block, and get the output as an org table right back into your document.
Apr 10 16:43:29 <mplsCorwin>	This is sounding more and more like a BBDB to me.  Maybe driving insert/update from changes to org-mode sources if there's a narrative or other data worth keeping outside the contact list.
Apr 10 16:44:04 <mplsCorwin>	Or yea, recutil may well be perfect for this.
Apr 10 16:44:12 <quiliro>	I can make a list of products from ledger-mode
Apr 10 16:44:26 <quiliro>	I can make a list of providers from org mode too
Apr 10 16:44:46 <quiliro>	ledger-mode I meant
Apr 10 16:45:18 <mplsCorwin>	quiliro: what I'm getting from this convo is there are quite a few reasonable ways to do this.  Maybe make a list of what you need to be able to do in order of importance and then you can pick based on how much work you want to make of it.
Apr 10 16:45:22 <quiliro>	I don't know how to make a list of products that come from a certain provider
Apr 10 16:46:42 <quiliro>	I don't know how to make the list of provider contact details
Apr 10 16:47:11 <quiliro>	I mean the contact details of each provider
Apr 10 16:47:32 <mplsCorwin>	Something is going to have to compare the sets, I guess.  If you use an RDBMS (even recutil) the DB is that thing.  If you roll something in emacs then you'll need to write that function, including sourcing the data, performing the calculations/comparisons, and doing the right thing with the output (show a buffer, make a file), etc.
Apr 10 16:48:46 <quiliro>	OK...thank you...I will try BBDB since it is integrated with Emacs and will work well with the ledger-mode reports
Apr 10 16:56:15 <mbrumlow>	I am trying to debug this :( -> Error running timer ‘exwm-input--update-focus-commit’: (wrong-type-argument window-live-p nil)
Apr 10 16:56:28 <mbrumlow>	How does it know it is the wrong type? 
Apr 10 17:12:38 <wasamasa>	lol, managing 2000 products with emacs
Apr 10 17:13:59 <codingquark>	Good morning!
Apr 10 17:14:11 <wasamasa>	FYI, fsbot uses bbdb for its many factoids
Apr 10 17:14:24 <wasamasa>	it's not fast by any means, just convenient
Apr 10 17:14:32 <bremner>	there's an endorsement :P
Apr 10 17:16:36 <codingquark>	My freedombox is not able to reach outside network, for some reason.
Apr 10 17:16:45 <codingquark>	Outside is able to reach it though
Apr 10 17:17:10 <wasamasa>	it has 15k entries
Apr 10 17:17:41 <bremner>	didn't someone make sqlite bindings for emacs?
Apr 10 17:19:56 <wasamasa>	emacsql is a thing
Apr 10 17:20:07 <wasamasa>	which shells out to a custom sqlite shell
Apr 10 17:20:20 <wasamasa>	which is terrible for obvious reasons
Apr 10 17:21:33 <wasamasa>	https://github.com/syohex/emacs-sqlite3 looks better
Apr 10 17:24:03 <Twist>	see also https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-sql.html
Apr 10 17:26:16 <wasamasa>	and ob-sqlite
Apr 10 17:27:18 <codingquark>	I do use things like sql-mysql or postgresql
Apr 10 17:27:37 <codingquark>	They let me copy-pasta, and that's all I really need from them
Apr 10 17:28:29 <wasamasa>	I still think programmatic use of babel is a bad idea
Apr 10 17:29:10 <hodapp>	what other way is there to use it?
Apr 10 17:29:17 <wasamasa>	interactively, duh
Apr 10 17:29:23 <hodapp>	oh, I see what you mean
Apr 10 17:29:37 <wasamasa>	pressing C-c C-c in a source code block, then waiting until it inserts something below

Apr 10 17:56:12 <codingquark>	Huh, weird things with my network these days
Apr 10 17:56:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Since pandemic or before?
Apr 10 17:56:50 <codingquark>	Since last 2 days
Apr 10 17:57:23 <codingquark>	Today my static IP expired. And I spent 2 hours trying to figure out which service or router config is fucked up
Apr 10 17:57:48 <ldlework>	Anyone wanna play some Go?
Apr 10 18:00:18 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Might it be ISP-side?
Apr 10 18:00:35 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: certainly it was.
Apr 10 18:00:41 <codingquark>	Got it fixed, as well.
Apr 10 18:00:57 <codingquark>	Then, my router started to refuse assigning IPv4 to my RPi
Apr 10 18:00:57 <parsnip>	let's benchmark retail sites
Apr 10 18:01:04 <codingquark>	,greet parsnip
Apr 10 18:01:05 <fsbot>	Olá parsnip!
Apr 10 18:01:16 <parsnip>	i cut my hair yesterday >.<
Apr 10 18:01:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Oh, that's odd.
Apr 10 18:01:28 <codingquark>	ldlework: if I manage to stay awake long enough, I shall try
Apr 10 18:01:33 *	parsnip looks for a hat
Apr 10 18:01:49 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: it runs OpenWRT, so it is not some messy OS issue
Apr 10 18:01:49 <ldlework>	codingquark: you make an account at online-go.com at your leisure
Apr 10 18:01:51 <codingquark>	parsnip: super!
Apr 10 18:01:59 <codingquark>	What style?
Apr 10 18:02:05 <codingquark>	ldlework: okay, thanks
Apr 10 18:02:10 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Oh goody, tried resetting the DHCP server?
Apr 10 18:02:22 <parsnip>	i dug out my clippers i haven't used in like ten years
Apr 10 18:02:41 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I rebooted the router, which seem to have solved the issue.
Apr 10 18:03:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: Well, that'd do it too. heh
Apr 10 18:03:15 <parsnip>	i think a 7 on top, then 6 5 4 near the edgeof top, 4 3 2 on sides, 2 1 near bottom
Apr 10 18:03:29 <parsnip>	i haven't actually gotten a good look at it
Apr 10 18:03:42 <parsnip>	it was jsut getting too thick
Apr 10 18:03:50 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: now it is not able to reach irc.oftc.net and I'm too lazy to check again.
Apr 10 18:03:58 <codingquark>	parsnip: sounds like a lot of work tbh
Apr 10 18:04:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: dig/kdig irc.oftc.net ; dig/kdig @1.1.1.1 irc.oftc.net
Apr 10 18:04:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: If you don't get results with your default DNS, then it's probably dns.
Apr 10 18:06:19 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: hmm, getting results with both
Apr 10 18:06:27 <codingquark>	So issues is with znc
Apr 10 18:07:10 <codingquark>	Amazing, now znc connected too
Apr 10 18:07:17 <codingquark>	Perhaps a lot of packets drops a while ago
Apr 10 18:08:21 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: thanks to you, it got fixed :)
Apr 10 18:08:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Didn't get beyond step-1 of debugging, but you're welcome all the asme.
Apr 10 18:09:55 <codingquark>	ha ha, indeed
Apr 10 18:10:33 <codingquark>	It's really late and I've been writing C for huawei chips all day long
Apr 10 18:10:34 <codingquark>	My brain is so dead, it did not want to think of dig before you mentioned it.
Apr 10 18:10:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh, fair. I know that feeling.
Apr 10 18:11:05 <wasamasa>	codingquark: why
Apr 10 18:11:14 <codingquark>	wasamasa: it is $WORK
Apr 10 18:11:15 <grym>	that sorghum won't harvest itself 
Apr 10 18:30:38 <codingquark>	Share your blog URLs, I shall add to feed if I haven't yet!
Apr 10 18:35:20 <sveit>	hello (tried this yesterday) i think i am hitting a bug in ivy-completing-read, but it seems like it would be so commmon/pervasive i am worried i am misinterpreting. when using ivy-completing-read with history and requiring match, ivy adds the last input, not the last completion, to the history. this is different than ido or the default completing-read, and messes up completion lists in applications.
Apr 10 18:35:48 <sveit>	Minimal example: https://pastebin.com/AKDhi1tg
Apr 10 18:38:00 <sveit>	the problem is that if you add a history variable, even if require-match is true, all these completion engines will add any element from history to the possible completions. if it is agreed this is a bug i can try to fix, but it seems somewhat embedded in the ivy-read function to do things this way
Apr 10 19:04:44 <markasoftware>	Are there any fuzzy matchers for IDO that support out-of-order matching? I.e, so that if I have a file named "2020-tax-reports.pdf", I will be able to find it with the search term "tax-2020"
Apr 10 19:04:47 <markasoftware>	i know helm and ivy are good at this
Apr 10 19:05:03 <markasoftware>	so far, i have tried flx-ido and ido-clever-match, neither works.
Apr 10 19:05:08 <markasoftware>	(by design)
Apr 10 19:06:20 <lxsameer>	hey folks, what's the equivalent of lisp `define` in elisp ? defvar ?
Apr 10 19:07:44 <spikemaster>	defvar and defun
Apr 10 19:07:59 <spikemaster>	and all the def* variations
Apr 10 19:08:49 <lxsameer>	cool 
Apr 10 19:08:55 <spikemaster>	defvar adn defun are split out i believe becuase elisp is a lisp2. variables and functions can have the same name so 2 defs are needed
Apr 10 19:09:40 <spikemaster>	the extra defs like "defcustom" are just some extra fancy ways to declare special things to wire them up with the emacs UI in a special way.

Apr 10 19:21:52 <lxsameer>	thanks man 
Apr 10 19:22:10 <spikemaster>	you may and to change apply to funcall.  looks like you are passing separate args rather than a list of args
Apr 10 19:22:42 <spikemaster>	and you may want to put a "," in front of docstring at the end of your macro
Apr 10 19:23:37 <spikemaster>	use macroexpand-1 to see what your macro actually expands to.
Apr 10 19:23:40 <spikemaster>	(macroexpand-1 '(defsystem blah-me (+ 1 1)))
Apr 10 19:24:09 <lxsameer>	sure
Apr 10 19:28:46 <mns>	Is there a way to take a space separated region and turn it into an org-table ? 
Apr 10 19:30:11 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Replace the spaces by | and press tab inside any of those?
Apr 10 19:31:14 <mns>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: actually its simpler then that.  Select region and do M-x org-table-create-or-convert-from-region.
Apr 10 19:31:36 <mns>	just found it.  sometimes I guess looking for functions helps
Apr 10 19:31:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh, neat.
Apr 10 19:32:14 <mns>	yeah I am surprised by the simplicity as well
Apr 10 20:11:45 <SLeePy1234>	Hi everyone, I'm learning elisp, going through the debugger documentation I found this
Apr 10 20:11:55 <SLeePy1234>	"edebug-all-forms controls whether eval-region should instrument any form, even non-defining forms"
Apr 10 20:12:10 <SLeePy1234>	may sound stupid, but what are forms?
Apr 10 20:12:23 <wasamasa>	top-level sexps
Apr 10 20:13:03 <mplsCorwin>	,sexp
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	sexp -- [0] an expression in lisp, also called a form
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	[1] (info "(elisp)Forms")
Apr 10 20:13:04 <fsbot>	[2] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Sexp
Apr 10 20:13:26 <wasamasa>	typically a (defun ...) or (defvar ...)
Apr 10 20:15:10 <bremner>	Lisp phreak: "Lisp doesn't have syntax". Also Lisp phreak: "Lisp has all these important forms"
Apr 10 20:16:35 <SLeePy1234>	I though edebug-all-defs already took care of defuns
Apr 10 20:16:54 <wasamasa>	hence why it refers to "non-defining forms"
Apr 10 20:17:11 <wasamasa>	like a (progn ...)
Apr 10 20:17:19 <SLeePy1234>	oh I see now
Apr 10 20:17:55 <SLeePy1234>	so progn steps would be skipped if edebug forms is nil?
Apr 10 20:18:01 <wasamasa>	,tias
Apr 10 20:18:02 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Apr 10 20:20:54 <SLeePy1234>	thanks :) really appreciate it
Apr 10 20:21:57 <wasamasa>	the exact behavior is... funny
Apr 10 20:47:01 <daniele->	hi!
Apr 10 20:47:49 <daniele->	is there a way in elisp to unpack a list? in python I can do `a, b = 1, 2`. is there an equivalent in elisp?
Apr 10 20:48:27 <wasamasa>	there's a bunch of macros binding list items to variables
Apr 10 20:48:39 <wasamasa>	destructuring-bind, pcase, -let, ...
Apr 10 20:49:44 <daniele->	wasamasa: thanks. where can i look for documentation?
Apr 10 20:50:37 <wasamasa>	the first two are part of emacs
Apr 10 20:50:54 <wasamasa>	the latter is from a popular dependency
Apr 10 20:51:02 <wasamasa>	they all have excessive docstrings
Apr 10 20:51:20 <lxsameer>	what's the appropriate way to change a record ? aset ?
Apr 10 20:52:12 <daniele->	wasamasa: which popular dependency?
Apr 10 20:52:15 <wasamasa>	dash.el
Apr 10 20:54:30 <dale_>	lxsameer: Must be?  Does it work?
Apr 10 20:54:50 <wasamasa>	records are basically structs done right
Apr 10 20:55:02 <wasamasa>	use the accessors/setters defined for that record
Apr 10 20:55:20 <dale>	wasamasa: Where are those defined when you use (record)?
Apr 10 20:55:36 <dale>	wasamasa: I don't see that they get names?  Unlike with something such as cl-defstruct.
Apr 10 20:55:43 <wasamasa>	yes exactly
Apr 10 20:56:09 <tobiasBora>	Hello,
Apr 10 20:56:15 <dale>	Oh, OK, now I see.
Apr 10 20:56:19 <dale>	Just kidding, I dont
Apr 10 20:56:22 <daniele->	wasamasa: i would not call the docstring of cl-destructuring-bind extensive :)
Apr 10 20:56:37 <wasamasa>	for more details there's the CL info manual
Apr 10 20:56:38 <wasamasa>	and CLHS
Apr 10 20:56:43 <tobiasBora>	I'd like to know, how can I quickly jump in Helm to a given entry? I can see numbers in front of the entries but not sure how to select them.
Apr 10 20:57:41 <lxsameer>	daniele-:  yeah it does, but there might be a better function to do it 
Apr 10 20:57:57 <daniele->	lxsameer: ?
Apr 10 20:58:26 <daniele->	i actually like -let better
Apr 10 20:59:02 <lxsameer>	daniele-: well, i thought there might be a set of functions dedicated to records
Apr 10 20:59:33 <daniele->	lxsameer: records? i think you are confused
Apr 10 20:59:52 <dale>	lxsameer: I think you meant to direct that to me, perhaps.
Apr 10 21:01:18 <lxsameer>	ah yeah sorry folks, totally confused the nicks
Apr 10 21:02:16 <dale>	lxsameer: ISTR I tried to use records once.  I don't see any evidence that I'm still using them today, so I'm guessing I switched to either cl-defstruct or else just lists/vectors.
Apr 10 21:03:36 <wasamasa>	hm, I thought of the #s(...) objects cl-defstruct returns
Apr 10 21:03:49 <lxsameer>	dale: i'm using cl-defstruct as well, apparently they're using records internally 
Apr 10 21:03:55 <wasamasa>	oh, these are records
Apr 10 21:04:01 <wasamasa>	why not #r(...) then
Apr 10 21:04:03 <dale>	Yeah, docs suggest cl-defstruct is just returning records.
Apr 10 21:04:07 <lxsameer>	dale: do you use setf to change the struct fields ?
Apr 10 21:04:16 <wasamasa>	> A “record” is much like a ‘vector’.
Apr 10 21:04:31 <wasamasa>	you can use aset, but really, use the accessors/setters defined by cl-defstruct
Apr 10 21:04:34 <dale>	lxsameer: Yes.
Apr 10 21:04:39 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: the name caused me a bit of confusion
Apr 10 21:04:41 <wasamasa>	don't break encapsulation
Apr 10 21:04:44 <lxsameer>	dale: cool thanks mate
Apr 10 21:05:19 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: does it actually create setters as well ?
Apr 10 21:05:29 <wasamasa>	if you tell it to
Apr 10 21:06:16 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ow , didn't know it. thanks
Apr 10 21:07:04 <wasamasa>	how else would the setf with an accessor form work?
Apr 10 21:10:32 <wasamasa>	it turns out the generated setter is a compiler macro to convert the setf form into an aset call with the right index
Apr 10 21:10:39 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: i'm a bit confused here, setf sets the value of the place to the given value right 
Apr 10 21:11:13 <wasamasa>	setf expands an accessor form to the equivalent setter form
Apr 10 21:11:53 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ahhh, so basically (cl-defstruct person name) with create an accessor person-name which using setf
Apr 10 21:12:03 <wasamasa>	for most stuff it's a trivial translation, like car -> setcar
Apr 10 21:12:05 <lxsameer>	it would be like (setf (person-name p) asdasd)
Apr 10 21:12:35 <wasamasa>	but in this case (person-name p) is turned into (aset p ...)
Apr 10 21:13:22 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: now i get it 
Apr 10 21:13:26 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: thanks a lot 
Apr 10 21:14:10 <wasamasa>	which means that unlike with the car -> setcar example, one cannot cleverly avoid the use of setf and would need to count slots instead
Apr 10 21:14:27 <wasamasa>	which I cannot recommend :>
Apr 10 21:14:41 <aidalgol>	Naming anything you make using words like "do what I mean", "sensible", or "smart" is just tempting fate.
Apr 10 21:14:50 <aidalgol>	e.g. split-window-sensibly
Apr 10 21:15:06 <wasamasa>	:D
Apr 10 21:15:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Good move not naming shackle something like "smart windows".
Apr 10 21:15:39 <wasamasa>	thank you
Apr 10 21:16:01 <aidalgol>	rudybot: wait, was that a back-handed compliment?
Apr 10 21:16:07 <rudybot>	aidalgol: "back-handed compliment"
Apr 10 21:20:20 <cvandusen>	rudybot: can you calculate two's back-handed complement? 
Apr 10 21:20:30 <rudybot>	cvandusen: that's a backhanded complement
Apr 10 21:23:54 <tobiasBora>	Another question, I'm trying to use use-package to set the display-line-number to nil in shell mode: http://paste.debian.net/1139609
Apr 10 21:24:00 <tobiasBora>	however it does not work
Apr 10 21:24:11 <tobiasBora>	Do I need to use hooks, or is there any better alternative?
Apr 10 21:25:55 <cvandusen>	Could you narrow down the paste? It's hard to parse that for the relevant code.
Apr 10 21:26:02 <dale>	tobiasBora: That's a big paste, I'm looking at the very bottom.  I think maybe you want to call (display-line-numbers-mode -1) in a shell-mode-hook function.
Apr 10 21:26:17 <dale>	tobiasBora: So, yes, add a hook.
Apr 10 21:26:31 <dale>	tobiasBora: (I mean that in the general Emacs sense, I don't know use-package very well.)
Apr 10 21:26:40 <tobiasBora>	dale: oh, I'm very sorry, I wanted to paste only the last part
Apr 10 21:27:05 <dale>	tobiasBora: The least you could have done was left some juicy logins/passwords in there too, sheesh.
Apr 10 21:28:05 <cvandusen>	Never thinking of others...
Apr 10 21:29:10 <tobiasBora>	ahah I'm sorry ^^
Apr 10 21:29:22 <tobiasBora>	So I tried that, but it still does not work http://paste.debian.net/1139612
Apr 10 21:29:46 <tobiasBora>	I'll try with display-line-numbers-mode instead
Apr 10 21:29:49 <dale>	tobiasBora: I would try (display-line-numbers-mode -1) instead of setq
Apr 10 21:30:09 <dale>	In this specific case I'm surprised it makes a difference, but I haven't looked at that code in a while.
Apr 10 21:30:09 <tobiasBora>	dale: indeed it works... But why? 
Apr 10 21:31:03 <dale>	tobiasBora: The only extra thing I see it doing is removing a pre-command-hook.  Maybe that's important.
Apr 10 21:31:12 <tobiasBora>	I don't understand why if I evaluate (setq display-line-numbers nil) it works, but if it's in the hook it fails
Apr 10 21:31:34 <tobiasBora>	dale: who is doing that?
Apr 10 21:31:39 <dale>	tobiasBora: But since you were doing (global-display-line-numbers-mode) to turn it on, I thought it was polite to turn it off with a function as well.
Apr 10 21:32:07 <dale>	tobiasBora: (display-line-numbers-mode -1), M-x find-function RET display-line-numbers-mode RET to see source.
Apr 10 21:32:14 <cvandusen>	Do you know if the code in the hook is being executed?
Apr 10 21:32:49 <dale>	When do global minor mode initializers run, before or after major mode hooks?
Apr 10 21:32:54 <dale>	I think before.
Apr 10 21:33:26 <tobiasBora>	cvandusen: well I guess it should if when I replace it with display-line-*-mode it works no?
Apr 10 21:34:08 <tobiasBora>	how, you mean that the global hook sets the variable, but then the minor mode display-line resets it?
Apr 10 21:34:14 <dale>	tobiasBora: FWIW, in your code that was NOT using a hook, you were only executing that (setq) form once, the first time something caused 'shell to be loaded.
Apr 10 21:34:46 <dale>	tobiasBora: And that setq under :config was being run in who-knows-what current buffer.
Apr 10 21:35:20 <dale>	Doesn't use-package require packages by default?  If so, (use-package shell :config (setq ...)) would run the setq with *scratch* as the current buffer.
Apr 10 21:35:46 <cvandusen>	It runs :config when the package is loaded. 
Apr 10 21:36:06 <dale>	Right, but isn't use-package-always-defer nil by default, some variable like that?
Apr 10 21:36:44 <dale>	Oh, it's more complicated than that, I forgot.
Apr 10 21:38:41 <dale>	But in this case, I believe tobiasBora originally had just (use-package shell :config (setq...)).  Without one of the other use-package keywords, I believe that means shell will be loaded immediately by use-package.
Apr 10 21:39:14 <dale>	tobiasBora: So I bet your original setq, without a hook, was setting display-line-numbers-mode in *scratch*, at Emacs startup.  (And then the value was killed when *scratch* was probably put into lisp-interaction-mode.)
Apr 10 21:40:02 <dale>	tobiasBora: Now, why your hook with (setq ...) didn't work, that is a mystery.
Apr 10 21:41:39 <dale>	tobiasBora: My first guess is that it works but you made a mistake in testing.  My second guess is that the pre-command-hook I mentioned was left on, and that somehow turns line numbers back on when it runs.
Apr 10 21:46:59 <fishyfriend>	hi #emacs! shameless plug for a new package: https://gitlab.com/fishyfriend_/execute-other-window
Apr 10 21:47:05 <fishyfriend>	(hope that's ok here)
Apr 10 21:49:42 <aidalgol>	Emacs in #emacs?  Outrageous!!
Apr 10 21:49:52 <MerlinTheWizard>	Hi all.
Apr 10 21:50:02 <fishyfriend>	:)
Apr 10 21:50:12 <MerlinTheWizard>	I'm trying to learn emacs, and that means I need to learn emacs info...
Apr 10 21:50:39 <MerlinTheWizard>	So I type C-h i and end up in info.
Apr 10 21:51:16 <MerlinTheWizard>	I type C-x C-f and open the info.info.<somethingorother>
Apr 10 21:51:44 <MerlinTheWizard>	And it says if you are new to the Info reader, type 'h' now.
Apr 10 21:51:49 <MerlinTheWizard>	So I type 'h'.
Apr 10 21:52:01 <aidalgol>	Don't do that.  Navigate to info manuals from the directory (the buffer C-h i brings you to).
Apr 10 21:52:17 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, ok, so what did I do wrong?
Apr 10 21:52:33 <aidalgol>	C-x C-f
Apr 10 21:52:41 <MerlinTheWizard>	This page here says to use 'C-x C-f':
Apr 10 21:52:44 <aidalgol>	You don't want to use that to navigate info.
Apr 10 21:52:46 <aidalgol>	Which page?
Apr 10 21:52:50 <MerlinTheWizard>	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InfoMode
Apr 10 21:53:15 <MerlinTheWizard>	It doesn't say the standard way at all.
Apr 10 21:53:20 <ahungry>	On some Emacs/OS setup, I notice my default "C-h i" info TOC is quite sparse
Apr 10 21:53:33 <ahungry>	To fix it so I get the same TOC as the CLI "info" call, I set these
Apr 10 21:53:35 <ahungry>	(add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "/usr/share/info")
Apr 10 21:53:42 <ahungry>	and also /usr/local/share/info
Apr 10 21:53:59 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: That's only for info manuals not on the default info path.  "Suppose you want to read an Info manual that is not in your InfoPath"
Apr 10 21:54:00 <ahungry>	there is an INFOPATH env var as well
Apr 10 21:54:05 <noobly>	Blackbeard: the reboot has gotten me much closer! 
Apr 10 21:54:09 <MerlinTheWizard>	So did I navigate to the incorrect file, or set info into the wrong 'mode', or what?
Apr 10 21:54:13 <dale>	MerlinTheWizard: Did you do the rest of the steps there, after the C-x C-f?  In particular M-x Info-on-current-buffer RET for example?
Apr 10 21:54:15 <aidalgol>	ahungry: Those should be in the default path list.  Something is wrong.
Apr 10 21:54:31 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: Let's back up.  What are you trying to do?
Apr 10 21:54:43 <dale>	MerlinTheWizard: Probably ignore me and listen to aidalgol.
Apr 10 21:54:46 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, learn info.
Apr 10 21:54:48 <ahungry>	Yea, I'm not sure, as they exist in INFOPATH as you'd expect 
Apr 10 21:55:17 <MerlinTheWizard>	I just want to know what's wrong. Did I put emacs info into the wrong state, navigate to the wrong file, or what?
Apr 10 21:55:32 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: OK, there's too much to try learning everything it can do at first.  Just try navigating the Emacs and Elisp manuals normally.
Apr 10 21:56:10 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidalgol, I got you on that. But can you or someone else answer my question please?
Apr 10 21:56:47 <MerlinTheWizard>	The file is info.info.gz. So is that the wrong file, or is it in the wrong mode, or what?
Apr 10 21:56:48 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: It doesn't look like you did anything wrong, but I would avoid using C-x C-f to open info manuals.
Apr 10 21:57:01 <aidalgol>	Yeah, you didn't need to do that step.
Apr 10 21:57:16 <aidalgol>	That would have opened the raw info source file.
Apr 10 21:57:36 <MerlinTheWizard>	aidolgol, no problem. But why doesn't info respond correctly. Am I even in info? The modeline says (Fundamental)...
Apr 10 21:57:47 <aidalgol>	You're not; that's why.
Apr 10 21:58:04 <MerlinTheWizard>	Okie doke, so I'm not in info mode. Ok, I get it.
Apr 10 21:58:31 <aidalgol>	I think dale was right about M-x Info-on-current-buffer being what would get you into info mode from there, but that's a roundabout way of getting to built-in documentation.
Apr 10 21:59:12 <MerlinTheWizard>	I agree. So I'll try to do it the correct way now.
Apr 10 21:59:39 <aidalgol>	ahungry: Which OS is this?
Apr 10 22:00:20 <MerlinTheWizard>	Ok, so I'm at the top level directory. Is there a quick way to get to the info info manual from here? Should I just search, or is there a shortcut?
Apr 10 22:00:51 <aidalgol>	MerlinTheWizard: Type h
Apr 10 22:01:08 <MerlinTheWizard>	Ah, ok aidalgol, thanks
Apr 10 22:01:25 <aidalgol>	Also, how's King Arthur these days?
Apr 10 22:01:40 <MerlinTheWizard>	I'm not sure right now. 
Apr 10 22:01:46 <MerlinTheWizard>	I haven't seen him in a long time.
Apr 10 22:02:06 <dale>	Probably social distancing.
Apr 10 22:02:25 <MerlinTheWizard>	Sensible hypothesis, dale.
Apr 10 22:08:43 <parsnip>	is holiday a neutral term?
Apr 10 22:09:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	In etymology, no.
Apr 10 22:09:42 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	https://www.etymonline.com/word/holiday
Apr 10 22:11:26 <tobiasBora>	dale: ok, I have no idea... Thanks for your help!
Apr 10 22:15:32 <bpalmer>	rudybot: stick a sword in a rock and we'll figure out some sort of reward for whomever draws it out later. 
Apr 10 22:15:53 <rudybot>	bpalmer: thanks to whomever recommended "ergo proxy"; I like the first two episodes at least.
Apr 10 22:16:24 <bpalmer>	rudybot: proxy voting is a poor substitute for a truly distributed electoral system.
Apr 10 22:16:29 <rudybot>	bpalmer: yeah, politically controlled voting districts are not sane, nor is the Electoral College process
Apr 10 22:17:01 <parsnip>	rudybot: later tell twb hi is there a more neutral term you prefer over \"holiday\"?
Apr 10 22:17:01 <rudybot>	parsnip: I asked `MemoServ' to forward the message to twb.
Apr 10 22:17:28 <bpalmer>	parsnip: what do you mean by neutral?
Apr 10 22:18:18 <parsnip>	bpalmer: like, i just like getting paid to not work, i want to say, "happy exemption day" to coworkers, without a reference to some sort of holiness
Apr 10 22:18:20 <grym>	 bpalmer: pH 7
Apr 10 22:18:38 <bpalmer>	happy paid time off day!
Apr 10 22:18:40 <grym>	parsnip: holiday is nonsectarian anyway
Apr 10 22:18:56 <bpalmer>	holiday may be associated with religion, but isn't particularly associated with *a* religion.
Apr 10 22:19:13 <parsnip>	yeah, holiday is /somewhat/ neutral
Apr 10 22:21:57 <grym>	parsnip: if it makes you feel better, "holy" and "whole" are very closely related ideas 
Apr 10 22:22:17 <grym>	and one can certainly speak of "good being-made-whole-ness" that is athiestic if you so choose
Apr 10 22:22:36 <parsnip>	"happy your day"
Apr 10 22:22:46 <wgreenhouse>	"nefarious" comes from conducting business on days where it was forbidden for religious reasons in the Roman calendar (dies nefasti)
Apr 10 22:22:53 <grym>	holiness and "set-apart-ness" are also related; cf also 'sacrifice' which doesn't necessarily mean what you think 
Apr 10 22:23:03 <wgreenhouse>	not giving time off is nefarious. I like that :)
Apr 10 22:23:10 <parsnip>	happy mind your own business day
Apr 10 22:23:23 <bpalmer>	as long as it doesn't mean me, I'm happy sacrificing anything.
Apr 10 22:23:35 <grym>	bpalmer: yeah that's the potentially not so great sense :) 
Apr 10 22:24:22 <grym>	but this is, uh, an interesting theological debate more than a usage conversation

Apr 10 22:37:14 <rpav>	wow i failed
Apr 10 22:37:24 <rpav>	sigh, long day
Apr 10 22:39:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rpav: Yeah, Ergo Proxy's good. Might care for Texnolyze

Apr 10 22:39:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rudybot: 
Apr 10 22:39:47 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	sorry rpav 
Apr 10 22:41:01 <rpav>	texnolyze D:
Apr 10 22:41:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	rpav: Don't like it?
Apr 10 22:42:50 <rpav>	i may have been too young to appreciate it or something, but all i remember was watching what i could only describe as the slowest and most non-eventful anime involving cyborg mafia (or yakuza or whatever specific crime syndicate) that is probably possible
Apr 10 22:46:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	heh, it wasn't quite that slow but yeah it's no shonen
Apr 10 22:47:43 <rpav>	i mostly appreciated slow/experiential stuff too, i mean .. i thought SEL was pretty neat heh
Apr 10 22:48:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	:3
Apr 10 22:49:23 <bpalmer>	SEL?
Apr 10 22:49:26 <rpav>	lain
Apr 10 22:49:29 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Serial Experiments Lain
Apr 10 22:49:44 <rpav>	i mean, i think stuff happened in that though .. it's been awhile
Apr 10 22:49:48 <bpalmer>	ah. I seem to recall that's the goto anime for talking about lisp's influence
Apr 10 22:49:55 <rpav>	hah really
Apr 10 22:50:38 <bpalmer>	See https://lain.wiki/wiki/Source_code (but C is also present, I guess)
Apr 10 22:50:47 <rpav>	ooh yeah
Apr 10 22:50:53 <bpalmer>	oh, mips-assembly
Apr 10 22:50:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Yeah. It also has a bunch of obscure early-Apple references.
Apr 10 22:51:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Remember NeXtStep?
Apr 10 22:51:26 <rpav>	quite
Apr 10 22:57:41 <bpalmer>	rudybot: that's one small nextstep for man
Apr 10 22:57:42 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Oh, I never found any information on him coding anything. I only saw a NeXTSTEP video on YouTube where he made a small app, and wasn't sure if he had just learned a bit for the demo.
Apr 10 23:22:38 <spikemaster>	is defstruct considered the best way to make structs in the lisp world?
Apr 10 23:23:36 <parsnip>	offby1: i found a good office supply store nearby: https://duckysofficefurniture.com/collections/all/products/test-product-1
Apr 10 23:40:19 <spudpnds>	Speaking of NeXTSTEP, WindowMaker 0.95.9 was released this month.
Apr 10 23:41:10 <gendl>	Hi, in emacs-26.3-x86_64/bin/, why is there both emacs.exe and emacs-26.3.exe, identical to each other, each taking up 136MB? 
Apr 10 23:41:21 <gendl>	can i delete one of these? 
Apr 10 23:42:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Are they hardlinked?
Apr 10 23:42:21 <gendl>	how could i tell? 
Apr 10 23:42:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	With stat they'd have the same inode number
Apr 10 23:42:34 <bremner>	ls -i iirc
Apr 10 23:42:48 <bremner>	although foo.exe sounds like windows
Apr 10 23:43:02 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Oh right. Missed that bit.
Apr 10 23:43:05 <gendl>	yes this is emacs  26.3 compiled for windows. 
Apr 10 23:43:48 <gendl>	from  https://ftp.wayne.edu/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-26/
Apr 10 23:46:19 <gendl>	the main launch program is runemacs.exe
Apr 10 23:46:35 <gendl>	it seems i can blow away emacs-26.3.exe with no ill effect. 
Apr 10 23:46:36 <gendl>	runemacs.exe still works. 
Apr 10 23:46:55 <gendl>	but removing emacs.exe breaks it. It looks like it's only using emacs.exe not emacs-26.3.exe.
Apr 10 23:48:37 <bremner>	it might not actually be using up extra space, but you'd need to ask a windows expert how to tell
Apr 10 23:49:01 <markasoftware>	What mechanism does electric-indent use to automatically re-indent a line ending with : when the : is typed?
Apr 10 23:49:23 <gendl>	bremner:  well it sure it using extra space in my build, where the built files end up on a Linux system. 
Apr 10 23:49:34 <gendl>	according to du -sk it's using plenty of extra space. 
Apr 10 23:49:38 <markasoftware>	the colon is not in electric-indent-chars and there's no electric-indent-functions
Apr 10 23:50:10 <markasoftware>	or rather, electric-indent-chars is set to (10), which seems like just the newline.
Apr 10 23:50:24 <gendl>	my whole build is ending up as 700-odd MB just for an emacs and a little common lisp program. 
Apr 10 23:50:35 <gendl>	things have become bloated beyond belief. 
Apr 10 23:51:09 <parsnip>	why would you put a .exe on linux?
Apr 10 23:51:40 <parsnip>	let me rephrase that. are you putting a .exe on linux?
Apr 10 23:52:00 <markasoftware>	the only thing i can find is that electric-indent-mode-hook is bound to c-electric-indent-mode-hook, but i would still imagine that it has to set electric-indent-chars to be able to do anything
Apr 10 23:52:22 <gendl>	because i'm running a distributed build system where a "manager" program running on a Linux host ends up managing the files
Apr 10 23:52:53 <gendl>	a linux host which is also running Gitlab CI fires off builds on Linux, Mac, and Windows, then collects all the resultant installer files. 
Apr 10 23:53:34 <gendl>	which for Windows means both a .zip version and a setup .exe made with Inno Setup. 
Apr 10 23:53:39 <parsnip>	wow, i had to uninstall amazon app to get it to stop showing blank pages
Apr 10 23:54:01 <parsnip>	there's even a review suggesting even "uninstalling update" didn't fix. i had tried clearing cache
Apr 10 23:54:09 <parsnip>	i wonder if clearing data would have fixed it
Apr 10 23:54:30 <gendl>	and those install .zip and .exe are getting incredibly bloated, so i'm going through trying to see where the main bloat is coming from.. 
Apr 10 23:55:38 <parsnip>	it seems like you want the "alpine linux" of emacs builds
Apr 10 23:55:53 <bremner>	I guess the windows binary must include a bunch of libraries that are shared on linux. I think the installed size is less than 50MB on linux
Apr 10 23:56:18 <bremner>	well, ok, closer to 100M with lisp files
Apr 10 23:56:18 <gendl>	parsnip: indeed.
Apr 10 23:56:23 <bremner>	but that's unpacked
Apr 10 23:57:25 <gendl>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/OBeN1eV7/
Apr 10 23:57:44 <gendl>	309MB and that's with the superfluous emacs-26.3.exe removed. 
Apr 10 23:58:12 <greenline>	speaking of WindowMaker, I was sad this did not continue: http://etoileos.com/etoile/
Apr 10 23:58:52 <gendl>	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/mwiN5ktT/
Apr 10 23:59:25 <gendl>	The share/emacs directory is 132MB - I don't see how the entire Linux install can be 100MB including binaries. 
Apr 10 23:59:46 <gendl>	unless for some reason the Windows one comes with a ton more lisp files. 
Apr 10 23:59:53 <ecbrown>	98MB is gnus 
Apr 11 00:00:18 <bremner>	it's possible. the uncompiled lisp files are about 17MB. Anyway I just did quick guestimate, so *shrug*
Apr 11 00:00:46 <bremner>	(and I didn't include the uncompiled lisp files in my estimate)
Apr 11 00:02:05 <ecbrown>	(i was just kidding, by the way)

Apr 11 00:19:39 <ecbrown>	intuition of a greybeard
Apr 11 00:25:43 <parsnip>	heh, "quarantine" means "40 days"

Apr 11 00:29:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Quarantine is derived from quarante, but it's not limited by its etymology.
Apr 11 00:29:25 <parsnip>	it is interesting that our lockdown has been approximately 15 + 30 = 45
Apr 11 00:29:43 <parsnip>	yeah, fsvo "means"

Apr 11 00:30:11 <parsnip>	i needed a catchy headline
Apr 11 00:31:20 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	So, I give up finding out what changed since Debian's package of Geiser and upstream's main.

Apr 11 01:43:13 <parsnip>	well, probably facebook fixed the problem, but figured out how to assess damages
Apr 11 01:43:20 <parsnip>	so like, overtime costs, etc
Apr 11 01:43:22 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, that's a shame.
Apr 11 01:43:27 <parsnip>	just guessing
Apr 11 01:43:39 <parsnip>	but if i was a lawyer, that's what i would think
Apr 11 01:43:47 <parsnip>	QED
Apr 11 01:45:07 <parsnip>	i think facebook also got a lot of heat for reacting and catching false positives, so maybe they can put a price on that too
Apr 11 01:45:21 <parsnip>	if i'm right that the two are related
Apr 11 01:54:55 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I'm not too fond of such networks.
Apr 11 01:59:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh. Was the change realy just in Geiser's scheme/guile/geiser/emacs.scm's ` (define·​(compile*·​form·​module-​name·​opts)​'
Apr 11 01:59:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	8 lines of change. That's what was breaking for me I'm pretty sure.

Apr 11 08:53:22 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Apr 11 09:13:21 <parsnip>	i just got a pop up on a web site, "Right Click blocked for business policy!"
Apr 11 09:13:34 <parsnip>	at http://www.bonettocinturini.it/en/catalogo/catalogo.php?page=3
Apr 11 09:14:13 <andinus>	try pressing alt, should override that
Apr 11 09:14:21 <andinus>	or maybe ctrl, i just disable that feature
Apr 11 09:14:37 <parsnip>	cmd+click does what i meant anyways
Apr 11 09:28:58 <roadie>	parsnip: very cool popup, I had to enable javascript to see it
Apr 11 09:29:18 <roadie>	so its opt-in
Apr 11 09:36:01 <codingquark>	wasamasa: I'm reading your gopher hole, and sometimes I feel I should ditch my stupid html blog and simply server gopher and rss
Apr 11 09:36:05 <parsnip>	i give up on picking a rubber strap for now. i'll order a cheap one after i get the watch.
Apr 11 09:36:21 <codingquark>	parsnip: do you dislike canvas straps?
Apr 11 09:36:27 <parsnip>	$50 on left, $550 on right: https://imgur.com/oKkrtlp
Apr 11 09:37:14 <parsnip>	codingquark: i think most will be floppy, because i like to wear my strap a little loose. rubber seems to hold it's shape better when loose.
Apr 11 09:37:28 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 11 09:37:48 <parsnip>	also, rubber seems easier to keep clean
Apr 11 09:38:00 <codingquark>	For sure
Apr 11 09:38:39 <parsnip>	maybe one day i'll try to get into the canvas, but i'm just assuming for now i won't like it.
Apr 11 09:39:33 <parsnip>	i bought some victorinox field watch thing a few years ago, and immediately returned it because i was surprised at how flimsy it was
Apr 11 09:40:14 <codingquark>	:O
Apr 11 09:40:37 <parsnip>	maybe one day i'll buy a really nice canvas strap and love it
Apr 11 09:40:51 <parsnip>	or w/e they're made of
Apr 11 10:05:28 <monotux>	I'm on 26.3, but I can't seem to use sieve-mode. it logins OK and when I try to follow a file to see it, it just hangs. if I abort (C-g) I can see the sieve file printed in the sieve-manage-log, but I can't upload my changes or create a new file. does anyone know anything more about this?
Apr 11 10:05:37 <monotux>	I'm compiling a mail to the maintainer
Apr 11 10:11:27 <fifi-v>	hi, how do I compose a ivy regex to match "ac" or "ad" or "bc" or "bd"?  (ivy--regex-plus "[ab][cd]") returns "\\([ab]\\).*?\\([cd]\\)", which means things like "aXXXc" will be matched too, which is unwanted.
Apr 11 10:21:30 <codingquark>	wasamasa: revision is on, quite nice actually
Apr 11 10:22:55 <wasamasa>	I dunno whether putting your blog on gopher is a good idea
Apr 11 10:23:08 <wasamasa>	same with self-hosting your git stuff :D
Apr 11 10:24:45 <codingquark>	Oh right, you've been on it since last week IIRC
Apr 11 10:24:48 <codingquark>	(at least)
Apr 11 10:25:10 <wasamasa>	yeah, I'm slowly coding up everything needed
Apr 11 10:25:35 <wasamasa>	so far the parts to export/initialize repos are done, currently figuring out how to statically generate pages with readme, file listing, usage instructions, ...
Apr 11 10:25:54 <wasamasa>	it turns out that my choice of mostly using rst and occasionally org/md wasn't that good :D
Apr 11 10:26:04 <wasamasa>	because rst is only properly implemented with python
Apr 11 10:26:10 <wasamasa>	and org with emacs
Apr 11 10:26:35 <wasamasa>	whereas only markdown allows me the necessary freedom for fancy postprocessing
Apr 11 10:27:55 <codingquark>	Shouldn't something like pandoc give more flex there?
Apr 11 10:28:08 <wasamasa>	I want to do it all in scheme
Apr 11 10:28:37 <wasamasa>	my blogs use rst and it sure takes time with all the shelling out
Apr 11 10:28:56 <codingquark>	Hmm
Apr 11 10:29:16 <wasamasa>	I wouldn't want to install pandoc on a server either, too many dependencies
Apr 11 10:29:27 <codingquark>	BTW, "Intriguing texts found on the web" do not refer back to OP, do they?
Apr 11 10:29:35 <wasamasa>	no
Apr 11 10:29:51 <codingquark>	pandoc is big
Apr 11 10:29:53 <wasamasa>	but the title is sufficient to find them again if needed
Apr 11 10:30:04 <wasamasa>	it's funny how the title won over the purl idea
Apr 11 10:31:51 <codingquark>	How?
Apr 11 10:32:12 <wasamasa>	by ease of use I guess
Apr 11 10:32:44 <codingquark>	Sure
Apr 11 10:33:00 <codingquark>	Fascinating one, on user-agents
Apr 11 10:33:14 <codingquark>	Now reading "On electronic wastefulness"
Apr 11 10:33:23 <codingquark>	And listening to the demoscene in the bg
Apr 11 10:33:46 <wasamasa>	copying or screenshotting the title is less work than figuring out some link that will survive linkrot :D
Apr 11 10:33:49 <codingquark>	Thinking if I should setup speakers in bedroom instead of study and listen that way.
Apr 11 10:34:09 <codingquark>	Linkrot is an important point.
Apr 11 10:34:30 <codingquark>	And pointing to archive links every time manually is pain
Apr 11 10:43:55 <aidalgol>	Can someone explain this reference from this week's n-gate for me?  "A webshit manages to question the React/javascript hypostatic union without provoking a Nestorian crisis."
Apr 11 10:46:15 <wasamasa>	I guess they mean that Nest controversy
Apr 11 10:48:26 <aidalgol>	Oh, that's less exciting.
Apr 11 10:49:15 <codingquark>	lol
Apr 11 10:49:28 <wasamasa>	I recall a hackernews piece on how web developers should not be allowed to build smoke detectors
Apr 11 10:50:12 <codingquark>	Oh no, in the name of democratizing tech, we are going to make interfaces for anyone and everyone to do everything
Apr 11 10:50:57 <wasamasa>	where the first mistake is to run a whole linux system :D
Apr 11 10:50:59 <aidalgol>	Does the verb "democratize" have any valid etymology, or did some writer pull it out of their ass one day?
Apr 11 10:51:18 <codingquark>	Interesting question
Apr 11 10:51:41 <codingquark>	Deciding, however, on a system other than linux will be the second mistake?
Apr 11 10:51:52 <codingquark>	I suppose the keyword there was "whole"
Apr 11 10:51:56 <wasamasa>	yeah
Apr 11 10:52:09 <aidalgol>	Let's just run FORTH on Arduinos.
Apr 11 10:52:12 <wasamasa>	smoke detectors should ideally be a simple circuit
Apr 11 10:52:21 <wasamasa>	going for a microcontroller is pushing it
Apr 11 10:52:31 <aidalgol>	hold up.  nest had a smoke detector??
Apr 11 10:52:31 <fsbot>	I'm telling you, you don't want to know.
Apr 11 10:52:33 <wasamasa>	and anything beyond that requiring an OS with internet connectivity, good luck
Apr 11 10:52:39 <aidalgol>	what the ever-loving fuck.
Apr 11 10:52:40 <wasamasa>	they did all kinds of home stuff
Apr 11 10:53:01 <aidalgol>	How does the Internet of Things^WShit keep on surprising me?
Apr 11 10:53:37 <aidalgol>	I thought you meant don't run linux for end-user PCs.
Apr 11 10:54:36 <codingquark>	But then how will I turn my lights on from my bed?
Apr 11 10:54:48 <aidalgol>	codingquark: AFAICT, browser-side web dev is so hellish because the community has ADHD and can't settle on any one thing for more than a couple months, if that.
Apr 11 10:55:12 <codingquark>	word
Apr 11 10:55:13 <aidalgol>	STOP FUCKING WITH THE FRAMEWORKS
Apr 11 10:55:39 <wasamasa>	> On April 3, 2014, sales of the Nest Protect were suspended, due to the potential for the alarm feature to be accidentally disabled.[37] [38][39] 440,000 existing Nest Protect units were recalled because of this problem on May 21, 2014 and a software update was distributed to disable this functionality.[40][41]
Apr 11 10:55:41 <codingquark>	"The last major release was 1 year ago, this is dead"
Apr 11 10:55:54 <wasamasa>	the update functionality is a great excuse to half-ass whatever you launch
Apr 11 10:55:59 <wasamasa>	you can still fix it with an update
Apr 11 10:56:02 <wasamasa>	or so they thought :D
Apr 11 10:56:26 <aidalgol>	codingquark: I am guilty of looking at the last commit date as a litmus test for whether a given project is still kicking.
Apr 11 10:56:28 <codingquark>	If you don't think that way, then you're late to market and won't be the one monopolizing entity
Apr 11 10:56:46 <aidalgol>	But that's commit activity, not major release date.
Apr 11 10:56:47 <codingquark>	aidalgol: that's still perhaps acceptable.
Apr 11 10:56:50 <codingquark>	Right
Apr 11 10:57:08 <aidalgol>	And that's only my *first* measure, not my first and last.
Apr 11 10:57:33 <wasamasa>	here it is: https://gekk.info/articles/iot.html
Apr 11 10:57:40 <aidalgol>	For my hobby game dev, I'm using lua libs that have had hard any activity in recent years.
Apr 11 10:57:48 <wasamasa>	> This article has been linked on hacker news, far more visibility than I ever expected, and unsurprisingly someone in the comments says they worked on it and my accusations are unfounded and it doesn't run Linux.
Apr 11 10:58:11 <aidalgol>	I'd probably be using really old blender add-ons, too, if 2.8 hadn't just come out with breaking changes.
Apr 11 10:58:30 <wasamasa>	that kind of ruins the story
Apr 11 10:58:50 <codingquark>	wasamasa: well if it does not run Linux then it is probably even worse
Apr 11 10:59:14 <aidalgol>	The last paragraph of that intro is great, though.
Apr 11 10:59:20 <codingquark>	Like, who in their right mind would think that they're going to write a better bootloader than u-boot for PRODUCTION hardware?
Apr 11 10:59:22 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Yeah, it probably runs WinCE 7.
Apr 11 10:59:28 <codingquark>	ha ha
Apr 11 10:59:31 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Oh, oh!  I know!
Apr 11 10:59:39 <codingquark>	RMS?
Apr 11 11:00:52 <aidalgol>	They did for something at my job because u-boot being GPL'd meant that they couldn't put their own obfuscated signature-checking shit into it to prevent someone on the outside putting unsanctioned OS builds on it.
Apr 11 11:01:36 <codingquark>	That is indeed interesting
Apr 11 11:01:53 <aidalgol>	Frankly, I'm a little surprised that after the "I'm going to make my own club where I can do whatever I want and you're not invited" corporate rage rewrite that is known as toybox, we don't have an analogue for u-boot.
Apr 11 11:02:05 <codingquark>	Instead of realizing that weird-ass sig checking shit is a shit move
Apr 11 11:02:26 <wasamasa>	> With apologies to the late Mitch Hedberg, always design your device to fail like an escalator, not an elevator. When an escalator fails, it becomes stairs. When an elevator fails, it becomes jail.
Apr 11 11:02:42 <aidalgol>	Maybe because every vendor already NIH's their own shitty bootloater.
Apr 11 11:02:44 <wasamasa>	thanks Mitch, I guess I won't be enabling HSTS, ever
Apr 11 11:02:46 <codingquark>	Oh, nice one
Apr 11 11:03:04 <aidalgol>	codingquark: This product is full of half-baked "security" measures.
Apr 11 11:03:35 <aidalgol>	If it didn't have failsafes outside our control, it would be terrifying.
Apr 11 11:03:39 <codingquark>	aidalgol: do you feel half-backed is a larger problem than having (and thereby knowing) none-to-basic sec?
Apr 11 11:03:50 <wasamasa>	I like getting paid for pointing out to other companies they have half-baked "security" measures, even though their own staff already told them
Apr 11 11:04:04 <wasamasa>	that's the best part of being a consultant
Apr 11 11:04:06 <codingquark>	haha
Apr 11 11:04:54 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Yes, because it will not stop a determined user from reverse-engineering our stuff, or malicious actors from successfully attacking users installations, and it makes our job harder, all while providing a false sense of security, as well as ass-covering for execs.
Apr 11 11:04:54 <codingquark>	First the devs put the measures there, then they spoke about it, then nobody trusted them, so they hired you, then you got to say they are right.
Apr 11 11:05:09 <aidalgol>	Oh, no, we in engineering all think it's stupid.
Apr 11 11:05:10 <wasamasa>	half-baked security measures are dangerous if you believe they help you and stop striving to do better
Apr 11 11:05:23 <aidalgol>	Product management tell us to put it there.
Apr 11 11:05:58 <adgtl>	You can run the command ‘flycheck-credo-setup’ with M-x f-cr RET [2 times]
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	Am currently using this company config https://0x0.st/iSwd.el (copy/pasted) along with `company-flex.el` two have fuzzy search a la Sublime Text but still, am facing two issues:
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	1 - the order: (see image)
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	2 - fuzzy doesn't work for HTML file/buffer at all.
Apr 11 11:06:00 <work_>	*NOTE*: I didn't test for other files beside elisp file*
Apr 11 11:06:01 <work_>	Is there I can add/remove to improve this?
Apr 11 11:06:01 <codingquark>	Make sure there is *some* password in the header. No need to validate it right now, will do as an update
Apr 11 11:06:09 <adgtl>	When I type -fcr nothing happens
Apr 11 11:06:12 <aidalgol>	work_: Too many lines at once.
Apr 11 11:06:15 <adgtl>	You can run the command ‘flycheck-credo-setup’ with M-x f-cr RET [2 times]
Apr 11 11:06:22 <work_>	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/mS6erQtg/emacs-company-issue.png
Apr 11 11:06:32 <adgtl>	folks, emacs is giving me suggestions which don't work
Apr 11 11:06:37 <adgtl>	what is emacs doing? :D
Apr 11 11:06:45 <codingquark>	Trolling?
Apr 11 11:06:47 <fsbot>	[->] troll is [0/4] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 11 11:06:48 <aidalgol>	And then when the senior engineers tell them what those requirements entail, they pick away at the proposal with a rusty scalpel until we have to implement something worse than nothing.
Apr 11 11:06:51 <adgtl>	M-x f-cr doesn't run that command
Apr 11 11:06:54 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: exactly
Apr 11 11:07:08 <wasamasa>	but having none isn't exactly better
Apr 11 11:07:12 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Think more obscure than that.
Apr 11 11:07:17 <wasamasa>	some baseline helps definitely
Apr 11 11:07:34 <wasamasa>	like ensuring a minimum of functionality, then ensuring a minimum of that is reachable
Apr 11 11:08:07 <wasamasa>	applying all security measures is lots of work and churn for not nearly as much benefit as that baseline
Apr 11 11:08:25 <andinus>	so lsp-find-definition is s-l g g, what does s mean here?
Apr 11 11:08:48 <aidalgol>	What's especially dumb about the DRM part is that most of our business is in servicing and a lock-in suite of products, and the industry has a creepy level of brand loyalty, so people tend to stick with whatever they bought in to.
Apr 11 11:09:25 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: It also helps if you have someone trying to poke holes in your shit.
Apr 11 11:09:40 <wasamasa>	that happens to be most of my job
Apr 11 11:09:42 <aidalgol>	The powers that be tend to go, "edge case. WONTFIX"
Apr 11 11:09:58 <wasamasa>	but it's in no way exhaustive
Apr 11 11:10:01 <adgtl>	(use-package
Apr 11 11:10:01 <adgtl>	  counsel
Apr 11 11:10:03 <adgtl>	  :ensure t
Apr 11 11:10:03 <adgtl>	  :bind ("M-x" . counsel-M-x)) 
Apr 11 11:10:09 <aidalgol>	Just for bugs and usability in general, not with security bugs in particular.
Apr 11 11:10:10 <adgtl>	but when I start emacs, M-x is bound to something else
Apr 11 11:10:13 <aidalgol>	,tell adgtl about paste.
Apr 11 11:10:14 <fsbot>	adgtl: try:  hpaste.el lisppaste.el openpaste.el paste2.el pastebin pastebin.ca pastebin.com pastebin.el pastebot
Apr 11 11:10:17 <aidalgol>	,tell adgtl about paste
Apr 11 11:10:17 <adgtl>	how to find out who is overriding it
Apr 11 11:10:18 <fsbot>	adgtl: Please do not paste mutiple lines of text into the channel. Use a paste service like http://ix.io/, webpaste.el or dpaste.com instead.
Apr 11 11:10:20 <wasamasa>	and relatively expensive work if you do it all the time for your products
Apr 11 11:10:43 <wasamasa>	some of that work could be avoided if you had sensible design before implementing that thing :D
Apr 11 11:10:43 <adgtl>	http://dpaste.com/1CJ3SDN
Apr 11 11:11:11 <adgtl>	folks, how to know my bind got overriden.. I am setting one but is not applied when I start emacs
Apr 11 11:11:11 <andinus>	adgtl: by bisecting your init?
Apr 11 11:11:26 <aidalgol>	Yeah, I second the bisect recommendation.
Apr 11 11:11:31 <adgtl>	andinus any simpler way?
Apr 11 11:11:49 <andinus>	idk
Apr 11 11:12:17 <andinus>	or just search for M-x in your init lol
Apr 11 11:12:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Let's just say that "architecture astronauts" comes to mind a fair bit here.
Apr 11 11:12:43 <andinus>	adgtl: if your init is overriding it then it should be there, also look in custom-file
Apr 11 11:12:56 <aidalgol>	What does C-h M-x say?
Apr 11 11:13:06 <aidalgol>	Er, not that...
Apr 11 11:13:13 <aidalgol>	C-h c M-x
Apr 11 11:14:19 <adgtl>	aidalgol my bad. I think I didn't load the related config in my init.el
Apr 11 11:14:22 <adgtl>	now it works fine
Apr 11 11:14:29 <aidalgol>	haha
Apr 11 11:14:39 <aidalgol>	fsbot: shoot adgtl
Apr 11 11:14:40 *	fsbot loads its slamhound and hunts down and blows up adgtl
Apr 11 11:17:50 <codingquark>	revisionparty people keep drinking coffee and it is no-coffee weekend for me.
Apr 11 11:18:58 <notnotdan>	why is it a no-coffee weekend codingquark ?
Apr 11 11:19:41 <codingquark>	notnotdan: to keep my brain from becoming addicted.

Apr 11 11:24:52 <codingquark>	No music for next 4hr?
Apr 11 11:24:53 <codingquark>	:(
Apr 11 11:25:03 <wasamasa>	or watch last year's stuff: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNqQO7lFY6dlIHKi5geI2faS00dzA0_2_
Apr 11 11:27:28 <codingquark>	I have forgotten one of my important passphrases and I've spent 2 hours since morning trying to recall
Apr 11 11:27:44 <codingquark>	So far, I have reached to the event in past when I had last typed it.
Apr 11 11:27:57 <codingquark>	I now have to take a break before I explore this further
Apr 11 11:32:10 <codingquark>	wasamasa: regarding On electronic wastefulness, perhaps situations like COVID-19 can push people towards relying on software more than hardware because hardware needs physical supplychain.
Apr 11 11:37:22 <lxsameer>	hey folks, how can i access the location (filename and line number) of where my macro is being called?
Apr 11 11:39:40 <wasamasa>	you can't
Apr 11 11:39:52 <wasamasa>	ask emacs-devel for better ideas
Apr 11 11:41:13 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: ahh, i thought it might be like some other lisps
Apr 11 11:41:17 <lxsameer>	thanks
Apr 11 11:47:59 <mplsCorwin>	Hmm.  Seems to have been a bad idea to (let (print-depth print-level) (print giant-hash-table))  10% CPU, 40% RAM and shows no sign of stopping.
Apr 11 11:53:35 <ldlework>	mplsCorwin: oops
Apr 11 11:55:30 <bremner>	,gourds
Apr 11 11:55:32 <fsbot>	SQUEEZE THEM!!
Apr 11 11:59:03 <libertyprime>	ugh.. this is triving me nuts. why would (activate-mark) not work programmatically? (i.e. as part of an interactive function)
Apr 11 11:59:33 <mplsCorwin>	,call-interactively
Apr 11 11:59:34 <fsbot>	You have no real enemies.
Apr 11 11:59:35 <ldlework>	libertyprime: are you call-interactively?
Apr 11 11:59:47 <ldlework>	noob
Apr 11 11:59:53 <mplsCorwin>	shaddap
Apr 11 11:59:56 <ldlework>	:)
Apr 11 11:59:59 <mplsCorwin>	:)
Apr 11 12:00:57 <libertyprime>	idlework: sometimes i cant fathom my own noobness. nah i dont think it can be called that way 
Apr 11 12:01:45 <ldlework>	libertyprime: (activate-mark) works for me
Apr 11 12:02:41 <ldlework>	(progn (beginning-of-buffer) (activate-mark) (end-of-buffer))
Apr 11 12:02:45 <ldlework>	this highlights the whole buffer
Apr 11 12:03:13 <ldlework>	There's also (set-mark-command)
Apr 11 12:03:42 <mplsCorwin>	maybe check C-h v transient-mark-mode?
Apr 11 12:04:05 <ldlework>	you can pass t/nil to (activate-mark)
Apr 11 12:05:11 <mplsCorwin>	Without transient mark you might not be noticing that it's marking the buffer.  I think that flag just tells activate-mark not to change TMM?
Apr 11 12:05:30 <libertyprime>	ldlwork: https://asciinema.org/a/QxgJBqyBkifhh1orh8k3xqdUM fml
Apr 11 12:11:42 <mplsCorwin>	Hrm.  What'd I do? ...  Eager macro-expansion failure: (error "Loading file c:/Emacs-27.0.90/x86_64/share/emacs/27.0.90/lisp/subr.elc failed to provide feature ‘subr’") [2 times]

Apr 11 12:12:01 <mplsCorwin>	ug, sorry.  Should have ,,paste,, that afterall
Apr 11 12:12:02 <fsbot>	Please do not paste mutiple lines of text into the channel. Use a paste service like http://ix.io/, webpaste.el or dpaste.com instead.
Apr 11 12:12:56 <yourfate>	using tramp and dired, is there an easy method to open a file on the remote system with su rights? Ideally it would be just navigate to file in dired and then do something like `s` to open it with sudo?
Apr 11 12:13:17 <codingquark>	http://ix.io/2hA7 <- I seem to have messed my HDD, it has data and I would like to restore it. Please help.
Apr 11 12:13:26 <yourfate>	I don't want to have to specify the path to the file again etc
Apr 11 12:14:59 <wasamasa>	codingquark: there's this data recovery nut on ##security, goes by flyback / beanbag
Apr 11 12:15:25 <codingquark>	wasamasa: thanks, joining!
Apr 11 12:15:47 <wasamasa>	hope you've got plenty of time and space for that adventure :P
Apr 11 12:16:12 <wasamasa>	time because every time you do it right it takes ages, space because you better work with backups and a read-only image of the disk
Apr 11 12:17:00 <codingquark>	Hmm, I think this happened when I tried reading ext4 on win10
Apr 11 12:17:10 <codingquark>	Some weird software fucked up my partition table
Apr 11 12:17:35 <wasamasa>	if it's just that, you should be able to recreate it with photorec
Apr 11 12:17:57 <wasamasa>	but still, better safe than sorry :>
Apr 11 12:18:36 <codingquark>	True
Apr 11 12:18:45 <codingquark>	Has some single copy files of mine in there
Apr 11 12:19:11 <wasamasa>	in that case I'd make a copy of MBR/GPT stuff to be able to revert easily
Apr 11 12:20:24 <wasamasa>	anyway, I should go over my disks, some are exhibiting signs of fragmentation
Apr 11 12:21:26 <wasamasa>	I've fixed a read error with flyback's help before and made copious notes
Apr 11 12:21:53 <codingquark>	I'm playing with testdisk
Apr 11 12:22:20 <wasamasa>	testdisk/photorec are parts of the same bundle
Apr 11 12:22:29 <wasamasa>	so that's what I was referring to
Apr 11 12:22:59 <wasamasa>	they can detect existing filesystems on disk and recreate a matching partition table
Apr 11 12:24:14 <roadie>	does that work on apfs partitions?
Apr 11 12:24:53 <wasamasa>	doubtful
Apr 11 12:25:23 <wasamasa>	https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk#Filesystems
Apr 11 12:26:57 <roadie>	I will have to wait to retrieve my lost 2TB partition filled with important data 
Apr 11 12:28:33 <codingquark>	It seem to have detected my original partition as MS, but it actually was ext4
Apr 11 12:28:37 <codingquark>	Let me write that change
Apr 11 12:30:36 <codingquark>	Restored!
Apr 11 12:30:39 <codingquark>	Thanks dude

Apr 11 12:32:17 *	roadie does it
Apr 11 12:32:26 <andinus>	,discourage roadie
Apr 11 12:32:26 <fsbot>	roadie: you didn't put nearly enough effort into it. Pathetic.
Apr 11 12:32:39 <roadie>	,judges
Apr 11 12:32:40 <fsbot>	it was very close, but roadie won by a nose
Apr 11 12:33:16 *	codingquark finishes taking notes
Apr 11 12:33:48 *	roadie waves the pathetic prize ribbon around
Apr 11 12:34:17 *	codingquark looks around
Apr 11 12:36:12 <lxsameer>	hey folks, I need to execute a one time function on specific file type when users open any of those file, what's your recommended way of doing this ?
Apr 11 12:36:32 <andinus>	hook it?
Apr 11 12:36:35 <lxsameer>	my aim is to make sure it's a one time thing 
Apr 11 12:37:07 <andinus>	one time for every emacs daemon?
Apr 11 12:37:11 <mplsCorwin>	have your hook remove itself.  maybe check something before installing it too
Apr 11 12:37:18 <lxsameer>	andinus: one time per installaiton 
Apr 11 12:37:42 <andinus>	yeah then hook and ask your hook to dehook
Apr 11 12:38:01 <roadie>	so it shows one partition on that HD - but it knows there are 2 - 'child count: 2' but it says the capacity is that of the only one partition it lists ... how does it know there are 2 partitions?
Apr 11 12:38:02 <lxsameer>	thanks folks

Apr 11 12:49:58 <adgtl>	Any good soul want to review my Emacs config? https://github.com/anildigital/emacs/tree/use-package 
Apr 11 12:53:23 <ldlework>	not even in org-mode
Apr 11 12:53:26 <ldlework>	smh
Apr 11 12:55:26 <work_>	In Emacs when your init file have error and you restart, is there a way for Emacs to at least tell at what line the error is located?
Apr 11 12:55:35 <ldlework>	work_: --debug-init
Apr 11 13:23:46 <roadie>	would it not work to assign a var a different value every 10 lines and then you know whereabouts the error is by reading it out?
Apr 11 13:24:43 <wasamasa>	or you could just search for the relevant forms and zone in
Apr 11 13:24:53 <wasamasa>	no, emacs does not preserve line number information, at all
Apr 11 13:25:44 <ldlework>	oh line number, missed that
Apr 11 13:26:04 <wasamasa>	the best you'll get is figuring out what form it was reading in and the position of point after it
Apr 11 13:31:09 <libertyprime>	ldlework: found the problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9069514/emacs-problems-with-activating-mark-in-an-interactive-command
Apr 11 13:31:25 <libertyprime>	basically, im a noob
Apr 11 13:33:26 <jamzattack>	Is there a way to run an idle timer only for a particular buffer? Currently checking the buffer in the function
Apr 11 13:33:45 <wasamasa>	that's the best you'll get
Apr 11 13:47:54 <giorgian>	Hi. Is there a way to get the file name from which a feature was loaded?
Apr 11 13:50:32 <ayuce>	hit `C-h f` and read the first line.
Apr 11 13:51:57 <giorgian>	Sorry, I mean non interactively, and often there isn't a function matching exatcly the feature name
Apr 11 13:52:31 <wasamasa>	`load-history'
Apr 11 13:53:20 <giorgian>	wasamasa: that's great, thank you
Apr 11 13:53:34 <wasamasa>	I can't recommend inspecting it with F1 v
Apr 11 13:54:55 <jamzattack>	yeah just got ~10 second hang...
Apr 11 13:55:31 <giorgian>	Yes, it got me worried for a few seconds
Apr 11 14:35:18 <codingquark>	wasamasa: shouldn't live stream have started by now?
Apr 11 14:36:18 <wasamasa>	there's a shader semifinals going on
Apr 11 14:37:07 <wasamasa>	my clock says 23 minutes left
Apr 11 14:43:46 <codingquark>	Your clock seems out of sync
Apr 11 14:44:13 <codingquark>	Hmm, perhaps you skipped opening

Apr 11 15:12:47 <codingquark>	wasamasa: is this a real person translating realtime?!
Apr 11 15:14:07 <wasamasa>	oh, I'm talking about revision, not divoc
Apr 11 15:14:20 <wasamasa>	but yeah, it's normal at CCC events for volunteers to provide live translation
Apr 11 15:14:26 <codingquark>	Amazing
Apr 11 15:15:04 <codingquark>	Let me checkout the part while they're talking about Germany's climate issues
Apr 11 15:18:29 <offby1>	parsnip: I can't go office-supply shopping now, you insensitive clod!!
Apr 11 15:20:56 <codingquark>	wasamasa: so in normal cases, people would gather and watch all these amazing stuff on a big screen?
Apr 11 15:21:00 <arussel>	https://orgmode.org/manual/Block-agenda.html#Block-agenda in this document aren't agenda and tags-todo function ? I can't find them with C-h f
Apr 11 15:21:18 <wasamasa>	codingquark: well, not me, but yes
Apr 11 15:24:52 <codingquark>	64k intro
Apr 11 15:26:02 <wasamasa>	most of these are from the revision 2019 playlist I've linked
Apr 11 15:27:15 <codingquark>	Oh
Apr 11 15:27:17 <codingquark>	I see
Apr 11 15:36:31 <wgreenhouse>	What is a good term for the phenomenon of a sleepy project suddenly getting a lot of commits now that the author is in lockdown?
Apr 11 15:38:03 <codingquark>	Hmm, it literally says demo for Revision 2019
Apr 11 15:39:50 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: I'd normally attribute that to spring cleaning
Apr 11 15:43:44 <codingquark>	But this has to do with lockdown
Apr 11 15:44:16 <wasamasa>	yeah, I know
Apr 11 15:45:26 <codingquark>	Lock it down!!!1!
Apr 11 15:46:06 <wasamasa>	this demoscene party from home has a great benefit, the parties themselves are not terribly engaging when there's no competition going on, so you can spend hours drinking, sleeping or coding up something on your rig, if you have any
Apr 11 15:46:21 <wasamasa>	but at home I can do whatever I want
Apr 11 15:46:39 <codingquark>	What else would you want to do?
Apr 11 15:46:50 <codingquark>	I'm being sarcastic
Apr 11 15:47:29 <wasamasa>	obtaining food is the most annoying thing
Apr 11 15:47:44 <wasamasa>	whereas cooking food at your own leisure is far nicer
Apr 11 15:53:08 <codingquark>	Oh yes
Apr 11 15:53:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ordering from delivery apps tends to minimize that annoyance.
Apr 11 15:53:23 <adgtl>	Any good soul want to review my Emacs config? https://github.com/anildigital/emacs/tree/use-package
Apr 11 15:53:32 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Of course now with the pandemic one can't trust that either. -_-
Apr 11 15:53:37 <codingquark>	Also I prefer drinking at home with close friends than drinking at parties with friends.
Apr 11 15:53:47 <wasamasa>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: you do that while you're on an event?
Apr 11 15:53:57 <codingquark>	Deliveries are closed here
Apr 11 15:54:05 <wasamasa>	ordering food during the pandemic is depressing
Apr 11 15:54:22 <wasamasa>	"Your order number is #7 and your pizza will be ready in 15 minutes."
Apr 11 15:54:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	wasamasa: Depends if the event has food. If not or it's thrice as expensive, yeah.
Apr 11 15:54:47 <codingquark>	If you want to go out far enough that you would need vehicle, allowed timings are 7am to 11am and 3pm to 5pm
Apr 11 15:55:06 <wasamasa>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: last Evoke had hot dogs and pretzels :D
Apr 11 15:55:09 <codingquark>	Ordering also means you're risking the other people
Apr 11 15:55:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: I wonder what they do regarding those without cars.
Apr 11 15:55:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	codingquark: And really? You don't have contactless delivery?
Apr 11 15:55:43 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: nope. Basically don't got out on streets at all.
Apr 11 15:56:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm. How does one get groceries without a car?
Apr 11 15:56:14 <neeasade>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: weren't you just talking about delivery
Apr 11 15:56:24 <neeasade>	groceries can be delivered now as well :P
Apr 11 15:56:35 <codingquark>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: right, for that 7-11am, 3-5pm in car/bikes
Apr 11 15:56:48 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	neeasade: Well yes, I know that. I was just confused by the "don't go out on the streets at all"
Apr 11 15:56:55 <neeasade>	ah
Apr 11 15:58:07 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	But yes, contactless delivery is probably safer than drive-through.
Apr 11 15:58:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	At no point does the customer interact with the chain at all.
Apr 11 16:01:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Months without going out. Hikki life~
Apr 11 16:01:56 <adgtl>	Folks how to fix http://dpaste.com/0WAH8G1 Warning (bytecomp): reference to free variable ‘counsel-projectile-grep-action’ ?
Apr 11 16:01:56 <bremner>	good practice for when we all go to jail for running illegal software
Apr 11 16:02:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: Meh, just move to countries that don't respect foreign copyright.
Apr 11 16:02:57 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: By illegal software, I meant free software
Apr 11 16:03:08 <codingquark>	ho ho ho
Apr 11 16:03:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: I know.
Apr 11 16:03:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bremner: But given the "recent" uptake of everything open-source (and often even Libre as well) in "Cloud" stuff, I think it's doubtful.
Apr 11 16:04:22 <bremner>	I was mostly joking, but talk to your central IT / admin types some time. It's a different world.
Apr 11 16:04:50 <bremner>	actually don't. it will just make you angry, but you get my point.
Apr 11 16:04:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I've actually worked in a lot of ops that are pretty much going full cloud.
Apr 11 16:05:07 <wasamasa>	I could never do these shader competitions
Apr 11 16:05:16 <wasamasa>	look at their braces not lining up
Apr 11 16:05:18 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: us too. Full Microsoft cloud
Apr 11 16:05:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Not for us, way too expensive.
Apr 11 16:06:06 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Outside of America Microsoft has a very weak offering, I find.
Apr 11 16:06:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	(As in, there's few reasons to go for them over Red Hat)
Apr 11 16:06:48 <codingquark>	wasamasa: totally ugly
Apr 11 16:06:54 <codingquark>	Much cringe
Apr 11 16:07:23 <bremner>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I'm talking about office365 and related crap. RH doesn't really compete in that space afaik
Apr 11 16:07:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Google Does.
Apr 11 16:07:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Which admitedly isn't much better.
Apr 11 16:08:29 <roadie>	are you saying there are people in this channel using office, running windows and searching with google?
Apr 11 16:08:32 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I thought you meant the LDAP infra, which is why I brought up RH.
Apr 11 16:09:07 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	roadie: Probably. Sometimes business policies are annoying.
Apr 11 16:10:26 <roadie>	if its business, ok no biggie
Apr 11 16:11:04 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	At home there's use for a separate machine with a GPU & Windows (consider the machine pwn'd) for those few games that don't work well on Wine/Proton.
Apr 11 16:11:44 <roadie>	I have my win7 box for the cryengine2 sandbox - totally resepected. of course it is offline.
Apr 11 16:11:53 <roadie>	respected even
Apr 11 16:12:00 <offby1>	re-specc'd?
Apr 11 16:12:12 <offby1>	are ee ess pea ee sea pea
Apr 11 16:12:13 <roadie>	Hut ab, Respekt!
Apr 11 16:12:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I have a separate gaming machine dual-booting Windows & Linux. Because I figure that the games being proprietary themselves, and how anti-cheats work, means it's pretty much malware-ridden even if I only use purchased games on it.
Apr 11 16:13:37 <roadie>	makes sense
Apr 11 16:14:29 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	The unfortunate thing is that while I can do that, I'm very aware some people can't afford to.
Apr 11 16:15:22 <roadie>	my favorite OS's were: DOS, Windows95SE, Blag GNU/Linux and now macos. All of them are great!
Apr 11 16:15:38 <roadie>	oh, 98SE ... Typo
Apr 11 16:16:00 <roadie>	Debian rules of course
Apr 11 16:16:11 <ldlework>	nixos bestos
Apr 11 16:16:33 <roadie>	,laugh
Apr 11 16:16:35 <fsbot>	BAAAAHAHAHAHAH HaHAHAA HA HA HHHHA AH *snort* HA HHA HAHAHA HA HAH HAH HAH HAHAH HAH HAH oh man HAH AH HAAAAAHAAAHHH *cough* *cough* *cough* hah hehhh hehhhhh geez.. *cough*
Apr 11 16:16:40 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	OSX is generally more comfortable than Windows.
Apr 11 16:17:48 <roadie>	I had to get OSX when I saw the transparent terminal windows piling up in the girl with the dragon tattoo
Apr 11 16:18:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	For home stuff, I find that Debian & Arch/Manjaro are decent daily-drivers. Guix System will one day be, but for now it's mostly messing around in a dev VM 
Apr 11 16:19:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	roadie: Can't you do that fairly easily with openbox & terminator?
Apr 11 16:21:23 <roadie>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: I would not know - I ran blackbox once but that's it
Apr 11 16:21:31 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah I see.
Apr 11 16:22:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I just checked, one can also just install compton & urxvt, adjust composition (compton) transparency settings and it works.
Apr 11 16:22:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Btw, if you experience screen tearing on videos, it's worth checking if you have a compositor installed in the first place, and then if it's a good one.
Apr 11 16:25:00 <soda__hobart>	hi everybody, what is a good way to change tab width within just the current buffer?  I have an XSD file I am looking at, and the tab width is 8, but I would like it to be 2 or 4.
Apr 11 16:27:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Buffer_002dLocal-Variables.html Might this work?
Apr 11 16:33:08 <soda__hobart>	cool, yeah thanks, that worked.  come to think of it, I don't think I even needed the make-local-varaible func, because (setq tab-width) is for the local buffer anyways, it's (setq-default) to make it a default?
Apr 11 16:47:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	setq operates at another level that'd set it globally, iirc
Apr 11 16:48:17 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, setq-local is a thing though.
Apr 11 17:14:19 <codingquark>	ANSI art is cool
Apr 11 17:15:00 <codingquark>	Well, that was out of context for most
Apr 11 17:25:09 <wasamasa>	I remember creating big ascii art letters in notepad, then discovering many years later these can be generated by tools
Apr 11 17:25:55 <bremner>	that's a bit unkind as a characterization of ascii-artists
Apr 11 17:26:05 <technomancy>	lol
Apr 11 17:30:48 <wasamasa>	sure, but for random open source projects I have my doubts they wouldn't use figlet
Apr 11 17:31:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I consider it unlikely any simple lettering output on projects was done otherwise than by tools.
Apr 11 17:31:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Now for crack nfo files, that's a different story
Apr 11 17:32:15 <wasamasa>	true, these are the real deal
Apr 11 17:32:25 <wasamasa>	I don't get the rivalry between amiga and ansi style though
Apr 11 17:32:46 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I don't know enough of the topic to know of that rivalry.
Apr 11 17:32:59 <wasamasa>	then there's petscii
Apr 11 17:33:34 <wasamasa>	well, there's people who love extended ascii with block drawing characters and colors
Apr 11 17:33:47 <wasamasa>	and then there's people who love drawing things with slopes into some weird form of graffiti
Apr 11 17:33:48 <codingquark>	there are subcultures of a subculture, not surprising
Apr 11 17:33:53 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I've sometime wondered if they tend to make the art in ascii-first or if they make it in some bitmap drawing program first and then convert it.
Apr 11 17:34:38 <wasamasa>	petscii is something even more elusive with charsets used on the C64
Apr 11 17:34:56 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It just seems like making it in text first would, especially with block drawing chars, require an absurdly accurate and broad knowledge of the charset.
Apr 11 17:35:33 <wasamasa>	there's this shop selling amiga-style t-shirts: https://shop.harikazen.com/
Apr 11 17:36:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	heh, nice
Apr 11 17:36:54 <wasamasa>	though, I kind of doubt the `sl` train counts :D
Apr 11 17:38:57 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh, ascii tattoos are a thing. Neat.
Apr 11 18:55:37 <wgreenhouse>	huh, now I've seen it: a large complex package whose official build system is guix
Apr 11 18:55:41 <wgreenhouse>	proper dogfooding
Apr 11 18:55:46 <wgreenhouse>	https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/blob/master/build-scripts/guix.scm
Apr 11 19:00:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Huh, neat.
Apr 11 19:01:32 <wgreenhouse>	also neat in general. a webkit/qtwebengine browser largely written in common lisp, and designed to be hacked from SLIME
Apr 11 19:04:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	One day I'll stop being lazy and see about adding umatrix-like functionality to it.
Apr 11 19:07:13 <bremner>	I wonder how much of a nightmare it would be to package for debian
Apr 11 19:07:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I mean, you're packaging for debian. :p
Apr 11 19:07:45 <bremner>	right. But, as whois attests, I'm used to that part
Apr 11 19:08:57 <bremner>	upstream provides packages, which might or might not be a good sign
Apr 11 19:48:41 <sveit>	dale: sorry, i got disconnected yesterday, are you still around?
Apr 11 19:59:58 <parsnip>	offby1: dangit, i was trying to rick roll, you insensitive clod
Apr 11 20:04:56 <parsnip>	rudybot: do you believe in the horrendous space kablooie?
Apr 11 20:05:14 <rudybot>	parsnip: "big bang" is much shorter than "the horrendous space kablooie" or even "HSK" (when said out loud)
Apr 11 20:05:45 <parsnip>	rudybot: you know what happens if you say it out loud, though
Apr 11 20:05:57 <rudybot>	parsnip: oh yeah? YOu want to get into a big loud flamewar that is boring but happens to drown out the git discussion?
Apr 11 20:06:32 <giorgian>	Hi. How can I prevent files compiled by package to show up in recentf?
Apr 11 20:08:23 <parsnip>	giorgian: i went to source file of recentf and searched for "regex", and found some leads
Apr 11 20:08:45 <giorgian>	parsnip: thank you
Apr 11 20:08:58 <parsnip>	maybe a better way to do that is M-x customize-group RET recentf RET
Apr 11 20:09:34 <parsnip>	my next research would be info-apropos recentf, but i hate cuz it's slow
Apr 11 20:11:17 <parsnip>	emacs info manual does mention recentf-edit-list, if you need to clean up an existing list, i guess
Apr 11 20:11:33 <parsnip>	(i just C-s search emacs's info manual
Apr 11 20:11:35 <parsnip>	)
Apr 11 20:12:04 <giorgian>	yes, I found recentf-edit-list, but I don't want to do that every time I install or upgrade a package...
Apr 11 20:24:59 <markasoftware>	What's the logic behind c-mode implementing their own electric indentation instead of relying on electric-indent-mode?
Apr 11 20:25:11 <bremner>	lol, logic
Apr 11 20:25:18 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Grandfathered in?
Apr 11 20:25:31 <markasoftware>	ok lol
Apr 11 20:25:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I wasn't stating so, just guessing it might predate it.
Apr 11 20:26:06 <markasoftware>	i'm thinking of disabling the special c-electric-flag and just turning on electric-indent-mode, was wondering why it's not like that by default
Apr 11 20:30:47 <giorgian>	wow, it only took me two attempts to edit the regex correctly!
Apr 11 20:31:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	gratz
Apr 11 20:44:22 <johnjay>	>logic
Apr 11 20:44:26 <johnjay>	>emacs
Apr 11 20:44:26 <johnjay>	wat
Apr 11 20:44:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I mean, pretty much any legacy codebase will have this kind of stuff where completely redundant code is kept because refactoring isn't a thing.
Apr 11 21:33:04 <jfb4>	emacs tty seems to have a lot of advantages over emacs gui.  Even things like certain key combinations being impossible actually helps your rsi.
Apr 11 21:33:05 <jfb4>	  
Apr 11 21:34:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I find that good posture and actually using the duplicates of keys on your keyboard (like meta & shift) helps.
Apr 11 21:34:31 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: emacs on tty is more limited (and limiting) than emacs on a 1970s lisp machine. But it's better than no Emacs
Apr 11 21:34:48 <Sketch>	that's the first time i've ever heard lack of features described as a positive ;)
Apr 11 21:34:48 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: that's fascinating - why?
Apr 11 21:35:13 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It doesn't mix well with tmux, which makes multi-frame usage annoying, for one.
Apr 11 21:35:14 <Sketch>	no space cadet keyboard on a tty?
Apr 11 21:35:16 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: do you mean the MIT Lisp machine that rms was involved with or the symbolics one
Apr 11 21:35:33 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: symbolics
Apr 11 21:35:36 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: zmacs on the Symbolics had vector graphics, good mouse support, and great modifier keys
Apr 11 21:36:00 <wgreenhouse>	tty emacs rather pathetic by comparison 
Apr 11 21:36:21 <jfb4>	yes I wish you could find a modern Space cadet keyb. There was a Hall Effect keyboard maker but that went out of stock.
Apr 11 21:36:23 <ldlework>	vector graphics in emacs would be so awesome
Apr 11 21:36:47 <wgreenhouse>	ldlework: well you can generate svg on the fly at least
Apr 11 21:36:48 <Sketch>	isn't there svg support?
Apr 11 21:36:54 <Sketch>	(on graphical emacs)
Apr 11 21:37:02 <ldlework>	Yeah but imagine doing in-buffer ui 
Apr 11 21:37:07 <ekleog>	what do people use nowadays to have a shell inside emacs? I can see shell, eshell and term, and these are only the built-in ones… can't even imagine how many shells there are in the environment ^^'
Apr 11 21:37:15 <ldlework>	like an outline around a text input or something
Apr 11 21:37:17 <ldlework>	just simple stuff
Apr 11 21:37:19 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: emacs tty seems so much more stable (in conjunction with GNU screen) over the network 
Apr 11 21:37:26 <wgreenhouse>	Sketch: yes, see e.g. ,,slime-volleyball,, for a goofy PoC
Apr 11 21:37:27 <fsbot>	slime-volleyball -- [0] <https://github.com/fitzsim/slime-volleyball>, an elisp clone of the classic Slime Volleyball game
Apr 11 21:37:27 <fsbot>	[1] upping the ante from svg-clock as a demonstration of Emacs SVG rendering for animation
Apr 11 21:37:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	term & ansi-term are okay
Apr 11 21:38:14 <ldlework>	had a conversation in another channel today about how it is surprising there is no termbox/urwid -like package for emacs
Apr 11 21:38:24 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: that's true. lispm model would be to have a beefy local workstation and a fileserver behind it
Apr 11 21:38:32 <ldlework>	like, yeah, those kind of libraries are annoying to write as it's super finicky and it's a bunch of work
Apr 11 21:38:36 <wgreenhouse>	lispm was fundamentally a single user platform
Apr 11 21:38:37 <ldlework>	but emacs been out for a while :)
Apr 11 21:39:06 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: ok, thanks :) I'll have a look at it!
Apr 11 21:39:52 <jfb4>	wgreenhouse: why do you think rms seems to prefer the console (according to emacs-devel)
Apr 11 21:40:14 <ldlework>	jfb4: do you know how incredibly useful image tooltips are in org-mode documents?
Apr 11 21:40:24 <aidalgol>	fsbot: lispm?
Apr 11 21:40:25 <fsbot>	try:  AutoLispMode ElispMailSigs ElispManual EmacsLispManual GoLispMode ILispMode InferiorEmacsLispMode LispMachine LispMachines LispMeralda LispmeraldaArchive MitCadrLispm
Apr 11 21:40:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	jfb4: Probably because the machines he uses aren't exactly what one could call beefy.
Apr 11 21:40:55 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	When you're stuck <2G of RAM, you'll avoid the overhead of a graphic server as long as you can.
Apr 11 21:41:10 <jfb4>	ldlework: thanks but I don't currently use org mode, but good to know.
Apr 11 21:41:24 <ldlework>	jfb4: killer app
Apr 11 21:41:32 <wgreenhouse>	jfb4: he also uses rmail
Apr 11 21:41:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I found mu4e to be nicer personally.
Apr 11 21:41:49 <wgreenhouse>	His .emacs would be as much ,,hell,, to me as yours: )
Apr 11 21:41:50 <jfb4>	I used to have lots of GUI nistance but over time I find having GNU Screen with several emacs (for some apps) works well
Apr 11 21:41:50 <fsbot>	hell is other people's .emacs
Apr 11 21:42:09 <jfb4>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: yes mu4e is what I use also.
Apr 11 21:42:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It's fast, but mostly it has a very nice user interaction ing eneral.
Apr 11 21:42:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	But the fact it doesn't block all my other frames is definitely good.
Apr 11 21:42:51 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: is there, like, an easy way to kill the term buffer apart from C-x k <enter>? I'll probably just define one myself if not, but it feels like something that should already be there, so one could just pop-up a shell and close it just as easily
Apr 11 21:43:02 <ryouma>	there is a new one coming out, i think it is a c module or something --- 13:37 <ekleog> what do people use nowadays to have a shell inside emacs? I can see shell, eshell and term, and these are only the built-in ones… can't even imagine how many shells there are in the environment ^^'
Apr 11 21:43:07 <ryouma>	,termbox
Apr 11 21:43:08 <fsbot>	Th' MIND is the Pizza Palace of th' SOUL
Apr 11 21:43:23 <wasamasa>	how do these demo people manage to always put the horse shit first in compos and ramp up to the good things
Apr 11 21:43:37 <wasamasa>	the first pc 4k entry shows bible verses
Apr 11 21:44:12 <ryouma>	ekleog: i use shell beacuse glitches in term and term does not have obvious keybindings for everything i wnat to do.  it has issues though.  eshell is for those who do not have sunk costs in bash.  term is for htop.
Apr 11 21:44:17 <ekleog>	ryouma: hmm… got any references? `emacs termbox` doesn't look like it raises anything on google
Apr 11 21:44:31 <ryouma>	i was not claiming termbox was the name of the new one
Apr 11 21:44:39 <ekleog>	ooh thought so :)
Apr 11 21:44:49 <ryouma>	somebody here will know
Apr 11 21:45:02 <ekleog>	hmm so shell and term I guess, I have way too much sunk cost in zsh :°
Apr 11 21:45:34 <wgreenhouse>	,vte
Apr 11 21:45:36 <fsbot>	I think vterm is [0] https://github.com/vterm/vterm
Apr 11 21:45:37 <fsbot>	[1] https://github.com/emacsmirror/vterm
Apr 11 21:45:50 <wgreenhouse>	I think that's the new one
Apr 11 21:45:54 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I'm not aware of one, but that is mainly because I haven't looked for one. Old buffers get recycled by clean-buffer-list sometimes. Generally after a few hundred async commands are lying around with no-process, I open c-x c-b, create a macro searching for "no proc", mark d, and run it a few hundred times.
Apr 11 21:46:12 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I check that it didn't mark anything not intended to be deleted, and confirm with x.
Apr 11 21:46:36 <holomorph>	wgreenhouse: emoji commit messages, so futuristic
Apr 11 21:46:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	␣☣️
Apr 11 21:46:51 <ekleog>	wgreenhouse: thank you!
Apr 11 21:47:04 <ryouma>	shell is based on comint.  comint was supposed to unify all the smiilar things.  it has glitches or obscurities.  or shell does.  idk.  but it is better than non-emacs.
Apr 11 21:49:20 <ekleog>	hmmmmmmm soooo that makes shell, eshell, term, ansi-term and vterm
Apr 11 21:49:44 <wgreenhouse>	ekleog: and compilation-mode (also comint derived)
Apr 11 21:50:24 <ekleog>	hmmmm
Apr 11 21:50:44 <ekleog>	wonder how much I could twist compilation-mode to compile over ssh (I've got some code I can only compile on a remote machine)
Apr 11 21:50:49 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: What's lispm?
Apr 11 21:51:24 <ekleog>	like, usually my process was git add, git push, then on an open shell on theremote git fetch, git reset --hard, build; but if compilation-mode were able to handle that it'd be awesome
Apr 11 21:51:25 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Could always connect via TRAMP+ssh over it and open a shell or term on it.
Apr 11 21:51:49 <ryouma>	i am confused.  compilation-mode is comint?  even shell compilation minor mode is just a think that lets you ret i think.
Apr 11 21:51:54 <ryouma>	thing
Apr 11 21:51:58 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Somewhat more fond of putting things in tmux sessions because it means if I manage to crash emacs or xorg, I don't lose anything.
Apr 11 21:52:32 <wgreenhouse>	aidalgol: a lisp machine for short
Apr 11 21:52:41 <aidalgol>	ah
Apr 11 21:52:46 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: or it is if you C-u M-x compile
Apr 11 21:52:49 <ryouma>	so you run x via tmux?  like, tmux startx or somethign?
Apr 11 21:53:07 <ekleog>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: thank you!
Apr 11 21:53:19 <wgreenhouse>	ekleog: compilation-mode is tramp-aware
Apr 11 21:53:26 <ekleog>	guess I now have asked enough questions to have package documentation to read for the day, so it'll be fun :)
Apr 11 21:53:27 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I rather more recommend something like: ssh user@server -t tmux attach
Apr 11 21:53:36 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Or just "tmux" if no session already exists.
Apr 11 21:53:45 <ryouma>	i never use compile.  also compilation shell minor mode is too slow.  but i would use it.
Apr 11 21:53:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: Otherwise connection loss can fuark your things up.
Apr 11 21:54:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: I run background tmux sessions, detach and reattach periodically to check for completion or launch new jobs.
Apr 11 21:54:17 <ekleog>	wgreenhouse: hmm I need to understand what tramp is actually about before that, like, it looks like that's remote-edit plus some… thousands of things? here I'd be hoping for local-edit, and compile by push+compile (because what Aurora_iz_kosmos is saying)
Apr 11 21:54:53 <ekleog>	(don't have stuff that takes hours to compile, though, so it's not that bad if connection drops, so long as I'm not editing over it)
Apr 11 21:55:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: So, if you're looking at your code on the remote machine and can launch a shell on it, then you could also directly use compilation in a buffer opened from that TRAMP session
Apr 11 21:55:26 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Mind, tmux is more advisable if cannot guarantee 100% connectivity during the build.
Apr 11 21:55:44 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: Those sessions survive xorg crashing as tmux daemonizes itself.

Apr 11 22:12:24 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: If all you want to do is file management you can use /scp:blah@bleh:/ and it'll work fine.
Apr 11 22:12:51 <ekleog>	oh cool :)
Apr 11 22:13:24 <ekleog>	so now, the last issue I guess (apart from how to actually get a shell) is tramp never prompts me for the 2FA code I need to enter to start an ssh connection, meaning that I have to manually start an ssh session in another shell before running tramp just to enter the 2FA code
Apr 11 22:13:30 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	? eh? Running a command from scp worked for me just now? That's new...
Apr 11 22:14:28 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ekleog: I guess you may disregard ssh-tunneling mode entirely then, just use scp.

Apr 11 22:21:01 <ekleog>	yeah, I've looked at tramp-shell-prompt-pattern, but theoretically it should first try shell-prompt-pattern, and I've tried adding  in this one without success
Apr 11 22:21:04 <parsnip>	hmm, maybe i should explicitly select "Teen Girl Bedrooms"

Apr 11 22:21:34 *	bpalmer looks at the channel
Apr 11 22:21:59 <ryouma>	idk what pinterest is, but 1) it is named pinterest.  it is not surprising that it asks for interests.  2) it is probably social.  it is not supruising that it asks for social information.  (this makes me sound like i am defending it.)
Apr 11 22:22:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	It's a social network which sometimes happen to be the only remaining host for copies of certain images from artist that decided to censor their whole galleries as cashgrabbing measures
Apr 11 22:23:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	DMCA'ing your stuff is demonstrating you're not worth helping.
Apr 11 22:23:19 <parsnip>	oh, i can select all. that's similar enough to none for me.
Apr 11 22:23:24 <ryouma>	i think there is an onion site thingie for archiving random sites.  cannot be taken down.
Apr 11 22:23:26 <ekleog>	yup, just tried adding  alongside > in tramp-shell-prompt-pattern, looks like it fails too
Apr 11 22:23:38 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ryouma: That is relevant to my interests.
Apr 11 22:23:43 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: trying to appropriate some one else's art is a terrible practice.
Apr 11 22:24:08 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I meant more hosting it on repositories like gelbooru (with credits & appropriate tags), and then having it removed because "lol they complained"
Apr 11 22:24:20 <bpalmer>	ekleog: not sure what that other character is; perhaps it is an encoding issue?
Apr 11 22:24:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Generally having the artist visible in tag categories is seen as helpful and desirable by users of such repositories.
Apr 11 22:24:48 <ryouma>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: quite useful for proving that bad guys did bad things
Apr 11 22:25:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Appropriating art would be more removing any credits and claiming you made it. Which is entirely distint from my use-case.
Apr 11 22:25:26 <ekleog>	bpalmer: it's the powerline marker, clearly utf-8, so encoding issues sound likely but I can't find a way to investigate that more, and it displays just the same way when I run ssh in eshell and when I'm on tramp-shell-prompt-pattern's customize buffer
Apr 11 22:25:30 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: the artist complains? Then the people posting it are violating the license and appropriating the artist's work
Apr 11 22:25:39 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: just like taking GPL code and using it against that license.
Apr 11 22:25:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I think we have a different definition of appropriation.
Apr 11 22:25:58 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I define as taking the credit for something you didn't make.
Apr 11 22:26:21 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	You put it online, it's online. QED
Apr 11 22:26:36 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: cool. Glad to know you don't believe in FLOSS
Apr 11 22:26:48 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: I rather consider that the opposite.
Apr 11 22:27:02 <bpalmer>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: sorry, someone puts the code online, it's online. QED.
Apr 11 22:27:24 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Aye. Which implies that respect of copyright and patents is also unnecessary, as well as licenses.
Apr 11 22:27:43 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Other than being a tad bit anarchistic, it doesn't seem very freedom-restricting to me.
Apr 11 22:28:09 <ekleog>	“tad bit” :D (this is neither an endorsement nor a criticism)
Apr 11 22:28:14 <bpalmer>	And copyleft licenses explicitly require licenses to be respected.
Apr 11 22:28:59 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I care more about public domain/free accessible than copyleft strictly.
Apr 11 22:29:05 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	*freely accessible
Apr 11 22:29:08 <jennie>	hello any chemist here
Apr 11 22:29:23 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	bpalmer: Copyleft is a mechanism required because of the oxymoron of IP.
Apr 11 22:29:43 <parsnip>	jennie: i make coffee, does that make me a chemist? i also took an introduction to chemistry class.
Apr 11 22:29:44 <bpalmer>	at any rate. I don't care enough at this time to get into an argument about morals, but people who think artists should never be able to stop rampant piracy of their work strike me as immoral.
Apr 11 22:30:00 <jennie>	lol
Apr 11 22:30:12 <parsnip>	don't drink bleach
Apr 11 22:30:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	And I consider hiding cultural references to be akin to censorship and just as ethically distasteful.
Apr 11 22:30:33 <parsnip>	don't mix ammonia and bleach, it can kill you
Apr 11 22:30:47 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Or at least, wear eye protection and an organic-vapor filter first.
Apr 11 22:30:48 <parsnip>	the mechanism of soap is really cool
Apr 11 22:30:57 <jennie>	i need some help looking to understand an equation
Apr 11 22:31:20 <bandali>	yeah bleach + ammonia produces chlorine gas iirc, or some other chlorine-related gas
Apr 11 22:31:36 <parsnip>	2 * H + O = H_2 O
Apr 11 22:33:32 <bpalmer>	jennie: you can ask your question and people may be able to help, but something like chemistry stack exchange may have more direct and experienced answers
Apr 11 22:34:36 <hodapp>	jennie: what level of chemistry? is this, like, grad level, or closer to high school or undergrad 101 level?
Apr 11 22:34:57 <jennie>	beginner level 
Apr 11 22:35:04 <jennie>	maybe highschool
Apr 11 22:35:13 <hodapp>	jennie: go ahead and ask. if I'm out of my depth, I'll try to tell you
Apr 11 22:35:31 <jennie>	Zn + Na2CO3 + 2H2O = 2NaOH + ZnCO3 + H2
Apr 11 22:35:37 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	My stance on IP can generally be summarized as: Abolitionism. Attribution/credits is simply kudos & good manners. But that's all.
Apr 11 22:36:12 <jennie>	the equation balancer tells that i will get ZnCO3 but wiki is saying that i will get ZincHydroxide, 
Apr 11 22:36:17 <jennie>	"Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode. Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced. The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide. "
Apr 11 22:36:36 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Also I'm mildly amused by the possibility of this being homework related.
Apr 11 22:36:50 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah it is.
Apr 11 22:36:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Heh
Apr 11 22:36:58 <hodapp>	I sort of don't care that it is
Apr 11 22:37:19 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	hodapp: Oh me neither, I'm just amused that #emacs was the resource someone chose to reach out to.
Apr 11 22:37:36 <jennie>	its not homework
Apr 11 22:37:45 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Ah, my bad.
Apr 11 22:39:20 <hodapp>	jennie: I'm seeing that also ZnCO3 -> ZnO + CO2 in the presence of 200-300 C heat
Apr 11 22:39:33 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	jennie: So, I may not remember 100%, but it may have multiple possible outputs.
Apr 11 22:40:36 <jennie>	ok, hodapp i ran that setup in a small water glass at home, i put sodium bicarbonate in distilled water and put 99% zinc rods in the solution and ran it, now i see lots of powder settled down at the bottom of glass, what is it?
Apr 11 22:40:40 <jennie>	is it ZnCO3
Apr 11 22:41:35 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	This whole thing is making me remember I should really read those chemistry textbooks I have in my archives.
Apr 11 22:51:16 <hodapp>	jennie: hmmm I suppose it could be but I am not sure how to verify that
Apr 11 22:51:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Perhaps it has a distinctive color when set on fire?
Apr 11 22:52:38 <jennie>	yes, i am wondering that too, lets assume that it is zinc carbonate, then why wiki is saying that electrolysis is making zinc hydroxide :?
Apr 11 22:54:12 <hodapp>	hmm, I'm seeing that zinc hydroxide is also a white powder
Apr 11 22:59:54 <jennie>	yes, i am just scratching my head for a while
Apr 11 23:00:54 <hodapp>	don't do too much of that, or the white powder will just be dandruff
Apr 11 23:02:01 <parsnip>	maybe dry it and weigh it?
Apr 11 23:04:59 <jennie>	i guess, i will re-do the experiment, with NaCl electrolyte this time, because i've just found this equation, what do you think?
Apr 11 23:04:59 <jennie>	 H2O + 2NaCl + Zn = ZnO + 2NaH + 2Cl

Apr 11 23:34:20 <technomancy>	geiser is very pro-interactive-development and racket is very much not, so I imagine it has to pull off some impressive hacks =)
Apr 11 23:39:42 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Is that so? I found that Racket is basically impossible to write without either interactive deployment or reading all the contract docs.
Apr 11 23:40:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Which I suppose they might be expecting us to do the latter...
Apr 11 23:40:09 <technomancy>	they have a saying "the top level is hopeless" which I find terribly depressing
Apr 11 23:40:16 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Eh?
Apr 11 23:40:21 <technomancy>	I think the assumption is that you restart your entire program for every reload
Apr 11 23:40:34 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	the top level is hopeless?
Apr 11 23:40:41 <technomancy>	that's what they call the repl
Apr 11 23:41:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Well. That's rather unlispy.
Apr 11 23:42:03 <technomancy>	it's definitely my least favorite aspect of racket
Apr 11 23:43:14 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	The genereal availability of REPLs has made it so most Scheme tooling sorta requires one.
Apr 11 23:43:41 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hence some of the hacks I'm reading.
Apr 11 23:44:06 <ecbrown>	you should try the scheme in gimp
Apr 11 23:44:41 <technomancy>	I agree, however the general way that programming works makes it so doing any programming in any language without a repl is unbearably tedious so...
Apr 11 23:45:39 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm, I'm not to the point where I find it unbearable, but it is definitely a noticeable friction/hindrance during development.
Apr 11 23:46:09 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	ecbrown: What version do they run?
Apr 11 23:46:41 <parsnip>	inb4 everyone is using zsh
Apr 11 23:47:17 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Hm?
Apr 11 23:47:39 <parsnip>	well... it's now default on macos
Apr 11 23:47:49 <ecbrown>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: not sure it has a version, just a scheme for an extension language.  it's remarkably productive though
Apr 11 23:47:52 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	parsnip: Ah, yes.
Apr 11 23:48:16 <parsnip>	i guess that doesn't mean bash isn't default on lignux

Apr 12 07:38:30 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: jordi@Iris:/temptrials/quarantine/bin$ ls
Apr 12 07:46:22 <arussel>	doing some orgmode programming, I can get a paragraph that will looks like: '(paragraph (:begin 20 :end 41 :contents-begin 20 :contents-end 40 :post-blank 1 :post-affiliated 20 ...) #("this is the content" 0 20 (:parent #0)))'
Apr 12 07:46:46 <arussel>	I see how to get the value begin, end, contents-begin ... but how do I get the value fo the text ?
Apr 12 07:47:42 <roadie>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=LgK5ZqjvC5s
Apr 12 07:47:49 <arussel>	bonus questions, is it a structure as describe here: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Structures.html ? is there a C-h XXX keybing to have description on how this is done ?
Apr 12 07:48:36 <dale>	arussel: It looks like a list to me.  I'm guessing you're using the org-element API?
Apr 12 07:48:50 <arussel>	yes I  am
Apr 12 07:48:57 <wasamasa>	that is text, just with text properties
Apr 12 07:49:22 <dale>	arussel: What wasamasa said, looks like the last element in that list is probably the content.  It's just propertized text, but it can be treated like a string.
Apr 12 07:49:29 <arussel>	so I can get org-element-propert :xxx, but I can't find the api for get me the text
Apr 12 07:49:29 <dale>	arussel: And no, I don't believe it is a cl-lib struct.
Apr 12 07:49:50 <arussel>	what does the #() means ?
Apr 12 07:49:58 <wasamasa>	propertized text
Apr 12 07:50:19 <dale>	arussel: Not org-element-contents?
Apr 12 07:50:51 <arussel>	this returns the list of element, so running it on para gives the exact same result
Apr 12 07:51:20 <arussel>	(nth 2 para) gives me the propertized text
Apr 12 07:51:24 <wasamasa>	it doesn't have anything to do with structures
Apr 12 07:51:34 <dale>	Hm, no, apparently not org-element-contents.
Apr 12 07:52:13 <wasamasa>	it should do it though
Apr 12 07:53:00 <wasamasa>	a list of the text and that parent
Apr 12 07:53:10 <dale>	OTOH my (org-element-at-point) doesn't return the paragraph string like arussel's did.
Apr 12 07:53:14 <wasamasa>	hence why contents is pluralized
Apr 12 07:53:31 <dale>	org-element-contents is just (nthcdr 2 element), so it should probably work.
Apr 12 07:54:11 <arussel>	and how do I get the text out of a propertized text ?
Apr 12 07:54:17 <wasamasa>	it is text
Apr 12 07:54:32 <wasamasa>	the only difference is that its printed representation scares the bejeesus out of newbies
Apr 12 07:54:49 <wasamasa>	and if you insert it, it may look funny
Apr 12 07:54:54 <wasamasa>	thanks to properties
Apr 12 07:55:29 <arussel>	it does, thanks all for your help :-)
Apr 12 07:55:44 <wasamasa>	if you for some reason want to get rid of its text properties, that can be done, too
Apr 12 07:56:04 <arussel>	no, I'm good with it
Apr 12 07:56:15 <wasamasa>	it's just that you often don't care and pass it around to whatever other function
Apr 12 07:56:38 <arussel>	and it is probably trivial to google it. The issue with orgmode is trying to google api stuff returns very little info.
Apr 12 07:56:52 <wasamasa>	trying to google elisp stuff is a bad idea in general
Apr 12 07:57:03 <dale>	arussel: I assume you've already found https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html?
Apr 12 07:57:05 <wasamasa>	use the built-in documentation, consult the source code when needed

Apr 12 11:38:39 <bremner>	anyway, not sure why we hate el salvador. They seem perfectly nice, at least the el salvadoreans I met.
Apr 12 11:39:19 <bpalmer>	there are no pupusas near me.
Apr 12 11:39:27 <bpalmer>	is there a better reason to hate?
Apr 12 11:41:03 <bpalmer>	the el salvadoreans ... is that like the hoi polloi, something to be avoided?
Apr 12 11:54:05 <roadie>	a little hate is always good when war is a force that gives us meaning
Apr 12 12:08:30 <giorgian>	What was again the name of the variable containing all loaded files and the symbols defined within?

Apr 12 12:13:10 <aidalgol>	sorry, been stuck in isolation with goats too long.
Apr 12 12:13:11 <rudybot>	bremner: I'm taking an intro to philosophy class this semester and so far the kids in there have been up to the point of almost depression, giving the rationale for why they believe in spirits another such thing. I don't care if you believe in God just give me a reason besides I don't know or my religious doctrine says it's true...
Apr 12 12:13:12 <DuClare>	braying makes you right
Apr 12 12:15:40 <roadie>	where does this 'uniquefoldername'>'index.html' structure come from? is that a database or PHP collateral or was it always meant to be like that... (thousands of index.html in their respective folders)
Apr 12 12:17:01 <codingquark>	Turning North can make you right
Apr 12 12:17:28 <bremner>	being xenophobic makes you right (wing)

Apr 12 12:18:27 <codingquark>	See I screamed as well a little
Apr 12 12:20:28 <aidalgol>	roadie: HTTP servers have had a default behaviour of serving index.html when the request URL ends in 'uniquefoldername'
Apr 12 12:21:54 <aidalgol>	I have no idea what you're looking at that has thousands of folders with HTML files in them.
Apr 12 12:22:06 <aidalgol>	I'm going to guess some kind of generated report?
Apr 12 12:23:32 <aidalgol>	bpalmer: I find it all rather bemusing because a_ the public sleep-walked right into this mess, b) Silicon Valley is not the entire software/technology industry, and c) many of the problems are not unique to this industry.
Apr 12 12:23:43 <aidalgol>	Maybe I should write a Medium.com thinkpiece.

Apr 12 12:28:20 <fsbot>	I'm telling you, you don't want to know.
Apr 12 13:07:16 <bremner>	ugh. Do I really have customize dired-listing-switches to get "human friendly" units in dired?
Apr 12 13:09:04 <codingquark>	I never got used to it, so I disable all those punk columns
Apr 12 13:13:54 <broquaint>	I've somehow managed to enable a mode (I guess?) whereby entering & followed by some combination of characters produces a multi-byte character (e.g &ff produces ﬀ), does anyone know what that is and how I can learn more about?
Apr 12 13:16:00 <wgreenhouse>	broquaint: that sounds like the TeX input method 
Apr 12 13:16:48 <wgreenhouse>	which is not actually for writing TeX, but lets you write various characters by entering their TeX symbol
Apr 12 13:17:21 <wgreenhouse>	,,df describe-input-method,, can tell you more
Apr 12 13:17:21 <fsbot>	describe-input-method is an interactive compiled Lisp function in

Apr 12 13:19:02 <wgreenhouse>	Ah hmm
Apr 12 13:19:08 <broquaint>	Not sure how I enabled that ... but at least I can do something about it.
Apr 12 13:19:24 <wgreenhouse>	Never used that one. Cool! :)
Apr 12 13:20:34 <broquaint>	It will be useful I'm trying to compose text with non-ASCII characters, it's proving less useful when writing rust and it's many &references ;)
Apr 12 13:22:35 <broquaint>	It seems Ctrl-\ is what toggles that input-method (and I definitely remember cack-handing that earlier).
Apr 12 13:30:21 <wgreenhouse>	Yup
Apr 12 13:40:37 <roadie>	aidalgol: of course, I forgot about the directory index.html autoload. thank you
Apr 12 14:34:59 <giorgian>	Hi. What's wrong with (call-process-region nil nil command t buffer) where buffer is an existing buffer? I'm getting: (wrong-type-argument integer-or-marker-p nil)
Apr 12 14:35:58 <giorgian>	The docs say "If START is nil, that means to use the entire buffer contents; END is
Apr 12 14:35:58 <giorgian>	ignored."
Apr 12 14:45:46 <giorgian>	I replaced nil nil with (point-min) (point-max) and now it's working.

Apr 12 15:10:23 <offby1>	smells like an actual bug, but that seems unlikely for such a widely-used function
Apr 12 15:10:36 <offby1>	I'd report it to the bug list anyway; it the very least, the doc string is confusing
Apr 12 15:22:00 <xristos>	it's not a bug, he's passing DELETE as t
Apr 12 15:22:14 <xristos>	(call-process-region nil nil command nil buffer) will work
Apr 12 15:24:15 <xristos>	i'd still file an issue to improve the docstring
Apr 12 15:26:08 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: frobnicate the turbo enbugulator
Apr 12 15:26:09 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: adds enbugulator to his vocabularity.

Apr 12 15:28:59 <giorgian>	So, I'm trying to write a function that greps a text in all loaded files, mainly to find out where a message comes from. It's mainly an exercise.
Apr 12 15:29:06 <giorgian>	This is what I got:

Apr 12 15:29:41 <minall>	Hello Emacs Community!
Apr 12 15:30:03 <xristos>	giorgian: you can use M-x multi-occur-in-matching-buffers
Apr 12 15:30:10 <minall>	I'm configuring my emacs, and I installed dark-room, making it start in every startup?
Apr 12 15:30:32 <minall>	I tried adding a hook and adding (dark-room-tentative-mode 1), but no luck
Apr 12 15:30:37 <giorgian>	xristos: no, I mean all evaluated lisp files, not open buffers
Apr 12 15:31:04 <giorgian>	Questions: 1) I should remove everything from the buffer before writing in it; how exacly? 2) Once my command is done, what is the right way to show the output to the user? 3) Is there a better way to do this?
Apr 12 15:33:09 <minall>	Why does emacs only include ELPA?, I find MELPA being quite good, is for libre reasons?
Apr 12 15:33:56 <roadie>	giorgian: I would record a kbd macro that marks the whole buffer - C-x C-k and done. Then I would add a keycombo for that. I know its klunky...
Apr 12 15:34:06 <andinus>	minall: melpa is not official
Apr 12 15:34:33 <minall>	andinus: What do you mean by not official? 
Apr 12 15:34:39 <sam_c>	it's made by a random guy
Apr 12 15:35:15 <andinus>	yeah emacs team doesnt manage it *officially*, there maybe some emacs dev involved (idk)
Apr 12 15:35:56 <roadie>	some of the melpa packages are in elpa where they become more official to install
Apr 12 15:36:49 <minall>	What is required for a package to be in ELPA?, tere are some good packages that are in ELPA
Apr 12 15:37:25 <wgreenhouse>	minall: following gnu contribution rules for emacs itself (licensing and copyright assignment paperwork)
Apr 12 15:37:29 <minall>	btw, about dark-room more, I added a hotkey, so every time a press C-q darkroom-tentative is activated, however, I want it to be at startup always
Apr 12 15:37:48 <minall>	Thanks for the answers guys, now I understand ELPA better
Apr 12 15:38:55 <roadie>	I would record a kbd macro of pressing the hotkey and then call that macro in .emacs
Apr 12 15:39:35 <roadie>	... after the hotkey is assigned
Apr 12 15:39:47 <andinus>	roadie: how to do that? i mean to record macro and store it
Apr 12 15:40:41 <roadie>	its C-x ( to start the recording
Apr 12 15:41:45 <roadie>	afk - to be continued
Apr 12 15:42:52 <andinus>	roadie: oh i know about that, i mean how do you save it to a file and call it in .emacs?
Apr 12 15:43:22 <xristos>	giorgian: 1. (erase-buffer) or (delete-region (point-min) (point-max)) 2. switch-to-buffer or (message ..) and let the user switch 3. async-shell-command
Apr 12 15:44:29 <giorgian>	xristos: thank you! How do I pass the content of the buffer to message?
Apr 12 15:44:30 <xristos>	minall: melpa has no real oversight, anything goes
Apr 12 15:44:34 <minall>	I do have a hotkey for activating dark-room-tentative-mode, however, I want it to, after startup to be already activated
Apr 12 15:44:45 <xristos>	so i'd avoid loading anything from there, automatically
Apr 12 15:44:57 <minall>	I tried to use hooks but, maybe I'm not using them correctly, and (darkroom-tentative-mode 1) on .emacs
Apr 12 15:44:57 <xristos>	well, i'd avoid using it completely
Apr 12 15:45:15 <xristos>	and that's coming from someone who has his own libraries there ;p
Apr 12 15:45:24 <xristos>	but that was done by others
Apr 12 15:46:03 <minall>	Thanks, I'll try to use only ELPA packages, I'm starting with a minimal install of emacs and that's why I'm stuck with darkroom mode, but I haven't added MELPA yet, and I'm now not planning to 
Apr 12 15:46:07 <giorgian>	minall: (require 'darkroom)(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'darkroom-tentative-mode) seems to work for me
Apr 12 15:46:07 <giorgian>	 
Apr 12 15:46:09 <xristos>	giorgian: you shouldn't pass an entire buffer's contents to melpa
Apr 12 15:46:15 <xristos>	*message
Apr 12 15:46:44 <xristos>	either switch to the buffer or let the user know with a small message so he can switch 
Apr 12 15:47:10 <giorgian>	xristos: you're right, thank you
Apr 12 15:47:14 <xristos>	the latter is preferable when you're executing asynchronous commands
Apr 12 15:47:24 <xristos>	since it's not clear when the results will be ready
Apr 12 15:52:12 <minall>	giorgian: I used the (add-hook) part, but not the (require 'darkroom) part, so that's my error... Such a noob error, well I just started yesterday
Apr 12 15:52:40 <tobiasBora>	Hello, I don't know why but I can't combine both smooth-scrolling-mode and auto-indent-mode.el. I get otherwise an error starting with "apply: Wrong number of arguments: #[(ad--addoit-function arg) ". I put a bug report here, but do you have idea what could go wrong? https://github.com/mattfidler/auto-indent-mode.el/issues/66
Apr 12 15:52:44 <minall>	Is there a part on the manual I should read for configuring emacs?, that will help me, thanks giorgian, I'll add it to my emacs config
Apr 12 15:53:48 <lxsameer>	hey folks, if you use `straight.el` do you know how to write a recipe to install a package by symlinking a directory in my fs instead of using git ?
Apr 12 15:53:50 <roadie>	andinus: (load-file "~/.myEmacsDir/myMacrosFile")      ;; enable my `macros'
Apr 12 15:54:43 <roadie>	(execute-kbd-macro (symbol-function 'myawesomemacro))
Apr 12 15:55:33 <andinus>	roadie: hmm so i did this, F3 C-k F4, that recoreded the macro and i can run it with C-x e, now how do i convert it to myMacrosFile ?
Apr 12 15:55:41 <roadie>	M-x insert-kbd-macro in the myMacrosFile
Apr 12 15:55:47 <andinus>	oh i see

Apr 12 15:56:26 <roadie>	yup - and in the macros file all your macros go so bookmark it

Apr 12 15:57:31 <andinus>	thanks roadie
Apr 12 15:57:40 <roadie>	yw
Apr 12 15:58:11 <roadie>	you can also stop macros for input - very nice feature
Apr 12 15:59:28 <andinus>	can you call macro with names?
Apr 12 15:59:38 <andinus>	like i did test macro, not-test macro
Apr 12 16:00:01 <andinus>	now i want to call test macro, C-x e will call not-test because it was last one
Apr 12 16:00:09 <roadie>	M-x name-last-kbd-macro
Apr 12 16:00:29 <roadie>	do this right after recording
Apr 12 16:00:32 <andinus>	yeah but thats for naming
Apr 12 16:00:35 <andinus>	wait
Apr 12 16:01:19 <andinus>	F3 C-k F4 M-x name-last-kbd-macro test F3 C-x b F4 M-x name-last-kbd-macro not-test
Apr 12 16:01:22 <roadie>	that saves it for the session - to save for posterity you bring up the designated macro file and M-x insert-kbd-macro RET macroname
Apr 12 16:01:27 <andinus>	^ lets say i did this
Apr 12 16:01:53 <andinus>	now i want to call test macro, id ont want to save it anywhere, just call it right now
Apr 12 16:02:04 <roadie>	F5 works here
Apr 12 16:02:19 <andinus>	hmm it says F5 is undefined
Apr 12 16:02:57 <roadie>	(global-set-key [f5] 'call-last-kbd-macro)           ; macro key
Apr 12 16:03:20 <andinus>	huh that will call the last macro
Apr 12 16:03:39 <andinus>	last macro is not-test, i need to call 2nd last macro i.e. test
Apr 12 16:03:52 <andinus>	so basically can you call macro by names quickly?
Apr 12 16:03:52 <roadie>	there is a macro ring - I never use it
Apr 12 16:04:03 <andinus>	i see, i'll look at it
Apr 12 16:04:08 <roadie>	if you named it you can just M-x it
Apr 12 16:04:32 <andinus>	roadie: yeah i was asking that, 
Apr 12 16:04:35 <andinus>	oh it works!
Apr 12 16:04:42 <roadie>	huzzah
Apr 12 16:04:44 <andinus>	cool

Apr 12 16:06:40 <wasamasa>	john conway died :<
Apr 12 16:06:41 <roadie>	I have a kbd macro that pulls 3 hosts files from the net, merges them, unifies the format, erases all comments and duplicate lines and pulls in the header and done to replace the current hosts file - could not figure out how to do that in elisp...

Apr 12 16:24:50 <sam_c>	:(
Apr 12 16:27:40 <giorgian>	When displaying an long image inline, is there a way to scroll vertically by less than the whole image?
Apr 12 16:30:12 <wasamasa>	the classic workaround is cutting up the image into slices :D
Apr 12 16:31:12 <bpalmer>	see pixel-scroll-mode
Apr 12 16:31:29 <bpalmer>	that may do the trick
Apr 12 16:33:53 <holomorph>	pixel-scroll-mode on an image locks up emacs here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 12 16:34:55 <bpalmer>	well, it scrolls by less than an image in that case.
Apr 12 16:35:27 <bpalmer>	rudybot: halting is the same thing as slowing down
Apr 12 16:35:28 <rudybot>	bpalmer: (when ( ... solve some halting problem instance ... ) (fset f 'oh-hai))
Apr 12 16:35:49 <tobiasBora>	I have an issue with LaTeX: usually when I type "C-c ? tikz" it opens the documentation of tikz, but in my new config it does not work... To be more precise, I have no error at all (hard to debug), and I can see okular (my pdf viewer) that loads for a second, and then it just stops.
Apr 12 16:35:54 <tobiasBora>	Any idea how I could debug that?
Apr 12 16:37:26 <bpalmer>	perhaps temporarily replace okular with a program that just logs what it's called with?
Apr 12 16:39:00 <tobiasBora>	bpalmer: Hum, I have some more advances, and it's still stranger
Apr 12 16:39:18 <tobiasBora>	so I wrote a script that "ps aux | grep olular" always to see what's the command
Apr 12 16:39:37 <tobiasBora>	and indeed when I run my command, there is a process that runs the command "/usr/bin/okular /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/generic/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf"
Apr 12 16:39:51 <tobiasBora>	and if I run this command manually, then the doc just pops out
Apr 12 16:40:23 <tobiasBora>	so my only idea is that maybe emacs kills for some reason the process
Apr 12 16:40:40 <tobiasBora>	do you know how it could be possible?
Apr 12 16:40:50 <tobiasBora>	(and if)
Apr 12 16:42:36 <tobiasBora>	(and also I can see very briefly a line "[okular] <defunct>")
Apr 12 16:46:36 <bpalmer>	It's possible, but I don't know how the system actually works
Apr 12 16:46:36 <giorgian>	bpalmer: thank you, pixel-scroll-mode did the trick. Now I can use elfeed for comic strips
Apr 12 16:59:25 <tobiasBora>	bpalmer: it seems to be a pretty fundamental issue, I just need to load auctex and it fails... http://paste.debian.net/1139942
Apr 12 16:59:36 <tobiasBora>	maybe it's a regression
Apr 12 17:07:19 <work_>	Hello, How to set the variable `truncate-lines` correctly? I tried `(setq truncate-lines 1)` in my init file but it still doesn't works.
Apr 12 17:09:08 <giorgian>	work_: It's buffer-local, so you should set it in each buffer. If you want to set it for every file, for instance, you can set (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () setq truncate-lines 1))
Apr 12 17:10:20 <giorgian>	sorry, that's (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))
Apr 12 17:10:25 <work_>	@giorgian Is this the only way to set it?
Apr 12 17:10:51 <work_>	for all buffers?
Apr 12 17:11:11 <giorgian>	that will work for all opened files. 
Apr 12 17:12:49 <giorgian>	Or you can set it for specific modes adding it to the relevant hook: for text-mode it would be (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))
Apr 12 17:34:28 <bpalmer>	rudybot: some texts need truncating with prejudice.
Apr 12 17:34:30 <rudybot>	bpalmer: There is, however, an implementation that requires only what you'll find in the R5RS, provided that you have a QUOTIENT and REMAINDER that implement either flooring or truncating division for non-negative arguments.
Apr 12 17:35:27 <work_>	giorgian: 
Apr 12 17:35:30 <work_>	Thanks
Apr 12 17:36:29 <bpalmer>	work_: if you truly want it everywhere, it might work to change the default value with setq-default.
Apr 12 17:36:51 <bpalmer>	but find-file-hook is a nice way of only having it operate on files you are opening
Apr 12 17:39:20 <work_>	bpalmer: 
Apr 12 17:40:17 <work_>	bpalmer:  `(setq-default truncate-lines 1)` you mean something like that?
Apr 12 17:42:08 <bpalmer>	yes.
Apr 12 17:44:02 <work_>	bpalmer: It doesn't work for me.
Apr 12 17:44:32 <bpalmer>	OK. Then go with the hook
Apr 12 17:47:33 <ayuce>	work_: if i understand correctly doc says it should be nil or t not 1.
Apr 12 17:48:35 <bpalmer>	"Non-nil means do not display continuation lines." -- 1 is a non-nil value, although maybe not the most obvious one.
Apr 12 17:48:55 <ayuce>	but (boolenp 1) returns nil
Apr 12 17:49:43 <bpalmer>	right, 1 is not a boolean, but the documentation (at least for 26.3) is only about nil vs non-nil
Apr 12 17:49:45 <bpalmer>	And (eq 1 nil) => nil. 
Apr 12 17:49:55 <ayuce>	it says > This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value satisfies the predicate ‘booleanp’
Apr 12 17:49:56 <work_>	ayuce: I just try with `t` but it doesn't work either. only the hook works.
Apr 12 17:51:32 <ayuce>	ok, hook it is then.
Apr 12 17:52:38 <work_>	It doesn't look nice tho. I was expecting maybe something like `(setq global-truncate-lines t)`.
Apr 12 17:55:13 <codingquark>	,praise wasamasa
Apr 12 17:55:13 <fsbot>	The EMACS is my strength and song; he has become my salvation.  He is my True Editor, and I will praise her, my father's True Editor, and I will exalt her.
Apr 12 17:55:26 <codingquark>	(for nov.el which has goto-toc)
Apr 12 17:55:32 <giorgian>	My erc configuration doesn't work, I keep losing logs...
Apr 12 17:56:02 <codingquark>	And my server that runs znc keeps disconnecting, I keep losing logs...
Apr 12 17:56:56 <giorgian>	it's a pity (and a pita) that #emacs isn't logged
Apr 12 17:57:17 <codingquark>	If I want to know which color the theme uses for hl-line-mode, how do I find out?
Apr 12 17:57:21 <giorgian>	on other channel I can at least go and read the logs on the web archive
Apr 12 17:57:33 <codingquark>	I feel I've messed it up without knowing somewhere in the config
Apr 12 17:57:48 <ayuce>	work_: maybe you could set it through custom. it says it would become default if you do that way.
Apr 12 17:58:58 <thomasb06>	Hi all.  I'm testing ERC!
Apr 12 17:59:06 <work_>	ayuce: you mean using the custom-groupe interface?
Apr 12 17:59:29 <kindaro>	How can I enable a certain minor mode in every buffer by default?
Apr 12 17:59:46 <ayuce>	work_: yes with customize-variable
Apr 12 17:59:47 <kindaro>	thomasb06: It works!
Apr 12 17:59:52 <codingquark>	Well, evidently I have not messed it up, says emacs -Q
Apr 12 18:00:44 <work_>	But if you use a different file for custum variable, the setting won't be portable afaik. or?
Apr 12 18:01:12 <bpalmer>	kindaro: if it's a global minor mode, you just activate it. If it's not ... why do you want it in every buffer? (Emacs creates many internal buffers that normally you don't see at all)
Apr 12 18:02:51 <ayuce>	work_: not if you port that "different file" too.
Apr 12 18:04:13 <kindaro>	bpalmer:  Well, I want it because it is the variable pitch mode and I believe in variable pitch. I have to switch it on every time I open a buffer. I would rather switch it _off_ in those, hopefully rare, circumstances when it does not look good.
Apr 12 18:06:58 <bpalmer>	kindaro: you could add it to something like after-change-major-mode-hook
Apr 12 18:07:28 <bpalmer>	it won't apply to buffers in fundamental-mode, but they're almost certainly internal buffers
Apr 12 18:08:19 <wgreenhouse>	also, most major modes inherit from a few parents (such as text-mode or prog-mode) with appropriate hooks, so you could place variable-pitch-mode in those hooks
Apr 12 18:09:57 <wgreenhouse>	kindaro: also, nothing stops you from making the default emacs face use some variable pitch font, and then use buffer-face-mode to selectively *disable* that
Apr 12 18:11:27 <work_>	ayuce: Yeah but I prefer to avoid that file. so when I move my init, file it is recreated automatically.
Apr 12 18:11:59 <snatcher>	is there a way to prevent html-mode changes to mark-paragraph?
Apr 12 18:12:18 <giorgian>	Wow, the bug I submitted about `call-process-region' has already been fixed!
Apr 12 18:13:52 <wgreenhouse>	giorgian: time travel??
Apr 12 18:13:52 <fsbot>	Of course not!
Apr 12 18:14:33 <giorgian>	wgreenhouse: it got fixed in a couple hours
Apr 12 18:14:38 <wgreenhouse>	nice
Apr 12 18:14:43 <wasamasa>	peak debbugs
Apr 12 18:14:58 <wgreenhouse>	I suspect this is a great time for high bug report responsiveness. %)
Apr 12 18:15:12 <giorgian>	so it would seem
Apr 12 18:15:14 <giorgian>	What is the easiest way to to run my own fork of a (m)elpa package or, better yet, to switch between my fork and the upstream project? How do people do that?
Apr 12 18:15:50 <wasamasa>	download, add to `load-path', set up autoloads as needed (or don't and just require it)
Apr 12 18:16:29 <wasamasa>	or do it the lazy way and use the existing ones package.el created for you
Apr 12 18:16:37 <wgreenhouse>	if you feel the need for more scaffolding, the elisp info manual has some guidance on how to run a local package archive for yourself
Apr 12 18:17:01 <wgreenhouse>	this need is also one of the motivations for ,,borg,, (a git-submodule-based alternative package manager)
Apr 12 18:17:02 <fsbot>	borg is [0] a system for assimilating emacs packages as git submodules. See https://github.com/emacscollective/borg
Apr 12 18:17:02 <fsbot>	[1] WE WILL ADD YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DISTINCTIVENESS TO OUR .EMACS FILE; I MEAN YEAH YOU'VE GOT SOME GOOD FUNCTIONS WE COULD USE. LIKE THAT ONE FOR FINDING ALL USAGES, THAT'S NEAT.
Apr 12 18:17:31 <wgreenhouse>	but all that's actually needed is download the elisp and start messing with it
Apr 12 18:18:40 <wasamasa>	I wonder whether the magic some people use to speed up loading is to set up a directory containing symlinks to all the elisp files and replacing the hellishly long value of `load-path' with one pointing to that directory

Apr 12 18:54:47 <bremner>	rudybot: sometimes I think YouTube doesn't really understand me: https://youtu.be/K4FESGjiH3s
Apr 12 18:54:58 <rudybot>	bremner: all over youtube, maybe start here http://youtu.be/50L44hEtVos (iirc the sicp video lessons also have all or most of the interesting stuff)

Apr 12 18:55:45 <Misha_B>	it's a good channel tbh
Apr 12 19:06:00 <SLeePy1234>	I wrote a small function using request and json to get some data from an api, the problem is that when I execute the function step by step with edebug it goes fine, while when I execute it normal without debugger it outputs nil
Apr 12 19:06:39 <grym>	i had to look like three times to see if i was in the right channel, heh

Apr 12 19:07:42 <wasamasa>	also, when doing async stuff don't forget to enable lexical binding or else
Apr 12 19:08:50 <bpalmer>	async is a conspiracy to foist lexical scope upon an unsuspecting world?

Apr 12 19:11:03 <bremner>	fancy. previewing links?
Apr 12 19:11:19 <scheming_around>	My emacs prints this at startup: "undefined: KEY must be an integer, cons, symbol, or string"
Apr 12 19:11:26 <scheming_around>	My .emacs.d/init.el is commented out
Apr 12 19:11:36 <technomancy>	kindaro: you must have installed a library for that; check the value of erc-modules
Apr 12 19:11:40 <scheming_around>	That error message isn't printed with emacs -Q
Apr 12 19:11:41 <bpalmer>	there is an erc-youtube module 
Apr 12 19:11:46 <bpalmer>	probably you have that active.
Apr 12 19:11:59 <bremner>	scheming_around: do you have some emacs packages installed via the OS?
Apr 12 19:12:21 <scheming_around>	Nope
Apr 12 19:12:26 <scheming_around>	I'm on macOS btw
Apr 12 19:12:43 <kindaro>	 Oh, I have youtube listed in modules. That's Spacemacs's doing. 
Apr 12 19:12:54 <bremner>	scheming_around: do the messages show up with -q ?
Apr 12 19:13:02 <scheming_around>	nope
Apr 12 19:13:47 <bpalmer>	scheming_around: do you have an ~/.emacs ? Do you have modules installed via package such as from elpa or melpa?
Apr 12 19:15:36 <scheming_around>	I do not have an ~/.emacs
Apr 12 19:15:49 <scheming_around>	I do have packages installed via melpa
Apr 12 19:16:10 <scheming_around>	should I delete~/.emacs.d/elpa and try again
Apr 12 19:16:47 <M4rkD>	Is there a nice way to "restart" an ewoc from a file? I'm going to guess not...
Apr 12 19:17:13 <bremner>	ewoc?
Apr 12 19:17:15 <fsbot>	ewoc is [0] a structure that organizes information required to construct buffer text that represents certain Lisp data. see (info "(elisp) Abstract Display")
Apr 12 19:17:15 <fsbot>	[1] not to be confused with the small hunter-gatherer teddy bears inhabiting the forest moon of endor
Apr 12 19:17:35 <bremner>	TIL
Apr 12 19:17:55 <bpalmer>	scheming_around: try moving it somewhere else, at least.
Apr 12 19:17:56 <M4rkD>	For some context, I've written a major mode to interact with a REST service, namely Azure DevOps (it's a bit like Jira if you're familiar)
Apr 12 19:17:58 <ornxka>	hi what is the "make emacs hang indefinitely" key
Apr 12 19:18:09 <ornxka>	i would like to know so that i can take care to not press it by accident
Apr 12 19:18:39 <M4rkD>	I was googling around for ways to do that, and I found about ewocs... so I tried them and they worked.
Apr 12 19:18:53 <M4rkD>	but I'm not convinced I'm doing things in particularly idomatic ways... :)
Apr 12 19:18:59 <bpalmer>	ornxka: if you're in a terminal, perhaps you're encountering the scroll lock functionality of C-s 
Apr 12 19:19:13 <bpalmer>	ornxka: if C-q gets you back up and running, that's likely it
Apr 12 19:19:15 <scheming_around>	bpalmer no effect :/
Apr 12 19:19:35 <ornxka>	bpalmer: nope it is the gtk gui
Apr 12 19:19:51 <ornxka>	minimizing and then reopening the window fixes it
Apr 12 19:20:13 <M4rkD>	Basically, the idea is that there are "tasks" on the remote server. I show one per line in my major mode, and have some keybindings to call remote services to change each task.
Apr 12 19:21:11 <M4rkD>	I made an ewoc for this, and added each task as an entry. It works quite nicely, despite having to write a lot manually...but I would really like to be able to save my file to disk and reload it in an "active" state...
Apr 12 19:22:09 <M4rkD>	I feel like I've made a wrong choice using an ewoc...they're neat, but I've lost some of the power of simple plain text...!
Apr 12 19:23:43 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: step 1 is to serialize whatever data you need to a file format, so in your mode override C-x C-s to do something. Whether that's just writing down the text directly as is, or writing all your state in a json serialization , or ..
Apr 12 19:24:05 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: then if a file is being opened in your mode, and it's not empty, reconstruct it all
Apr 12 19:24:35 <M4rkD>	Yeah, thanks bpalmer. Sounds sensible.
Apr 12 19:24:45 <bpalmer>	I don't think ewoc is a particularly common package to use, but it should be possible
Apr 12 19:25:13 <M4rkD>	I think it should be possible, I'll just end up with a text file that doesn't refect what's on screen. :)
Apr 12 19:26:10 <M4rkD>	I'm wondering, what would be the "idomatic" way to do this? I feel like I've started digging (it's my first big-ish major mode) and followed a weird route...
Apr 12 19:27:12 <M4rkD>	I didn't find a ton of stuff out there for people getting started with major modes, in terms of common patterns etc.
Apr 12 19:30:13 <M4rkD>	I think I should somehow be able to get the buffer that is shown on screen to just be a fontified version of the text file. It has all the information it needs to interact with the remote service.
Apr 12 19:32:57 <wgreenhouse>	ornxka: might've been ,,dk C-z,, which you should just unbind
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	suspend-frame is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘frame.el’.
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	It is bound to C-z, C-x C-z.
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	(suspend-frame)
Apr 12 19:32:58 <fsbot>	Do whatever is right to suspend the current frame. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 12 19:33:04 <M4rkD>	Dunno... maybe I'll persist down this route, using the serialisation suggestion (thanks bpalmer!), and think how to do things differently next time. :)
Apr 12 19:49:18 <bpalmer>	rudybot: if you don't talk to your kids about unix, someone else will.
Apr 12 19:49:20 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I think everyone should atleast have a very high-level understanding of "computer hacking", so it makes me happy when I hear people do have an intrest in it. I actually wish it was a class in grade or middle-school, and they throw kids into a unix shell and/or a emacs session.
Apr 12 19:49:34 <Aurora-Sensei>	bpalmer: lol
Apr 12 19:50:56 <bpalmer>	M4rkD: most modes I can think of roll it all by hand.
Apr 12 19:51:01 <bremner>	rudybot: talk to your kids about being Eunuchs
Apr 12 19:51:01 <rudybot>	bremner: but if all the kids tv shows show eunuchs then kids will think it's cool
Apr 12 19:51:12 <bremner>	that's the plan
Apr 12 19:51:44 <bpalmer>	rudybot: you can't just start writing targaryen propaganda before the watershed.
Apr 12 19:51:49 <rudybot>	bpalmer: daenarys targeren, cersei lannister, arya stark, brienne of tarth, melisandre, catlyn stark, olenna tyrell, yara greyjoy, ygrette, lyanna stark, ellaria sand, lyanna mormont, Rhaella targaryen ... all VERY strong and powerful female characters, and that's just in the tv series. I think the books had even more, but I never read them. You're not sure if that's very many? I'm sure that's quite a lot of very strong (and

Apr 12 19:55:33 <rudybot>	roadie: apparently fracking is to be given the go-ahead here because it is only likely to cause small earthquakes.
Apr 12 19:55:47 <bpalmer>	I don't think rudybot is much of a reader
Apr 12 19:57:37 <roadie>	he knows an awful lot though

Apr 12 19:59:30 <roadie>	it be nice to have a comrade bot and a wallstreet bot - they could insult each other
Apr 12 19:59:59 <scheming_around>	I managed to fix my issue by building the latest emacs from master
Apr 12 20:01:26 <scheming_around>	I have a different issue now: Emacs isn't starting evil-mode by default
Apr 12 20:01:43 <bpalmer>	did you move your packages back?
Apr 12 20:01:48 <scheming_around>	(use-package evil  :init  (setq evil-want-C-u-scroll  t        evil-want-integration t        evil-want-keybinding nil)  :bind ("C-e" . move-end-of-line)  :config (evil-mode 1)  (use-package evil-collection    :after evil    :config    (evil-collection-init)))
Apr 12 20:01:55 <scheming_around>	^ my config for evil-mode
Apr 12 20:02:09 <scheming_around>	i just nuked my packages and had emacs re-install them
Apr 12 20:02:28 <scheming_around>	right now the only package I have installed is evil-mode
Apr 12 20:02:46 <scheming_around>	and use-package I guess
Apr 12 20:02:50 <scheming_around>	(and all deps)
Apr 12 20:03:19 <roadie>	so you just switched issues?
Apr 12 20:03:39 <scheming_around>	Well I've had the evil-mode issue for a while nwo
Apr 12 20:06:32 <roadie>	I have to stick to emacs 25.3 - hyperbole 7.0.3 and zenburn from a long time ago so I don't have issues. plus ido-ubiqutous from the ancient times.
Apr 12 20:07:17 <M4rkD>	Thanks for the insight bpalmer! As a bit of a mode writing newbie, I'm still trying to get a feel for it. One of things I haven't gotten my head around yet is a feel for where to store data. This time I've opted for a hash table as a "database" that stores all my data, and the buffer is a "view" layer on the top. But it seems to me quite an "emacsy" thing to make the buffer the data store... I'm thinking of how I imagine modes
Apr 12 20:07:17 <M4rkD>	writable grep might work. Is it encouraged to try and follow the "data as plain text in a buffer when possible" approach...? Maybe I'm reading too much into it? :)
Apr 12 20:08:15 <bpalmer>	I think data as plain text in buffer is definitely a tradition in emacs
Apr 12 20:09:11 <bpalmer>	although it causes pain if, for example, you don't take care to make the buffer read-only and manually inhibit readonlyness while the mode itself controls all writes to the buffer
Apr 12 20:10:21 <tobiasBora>	Hello,
Apr 12 20:10:39 <tobiasBora>	I'd like to know, I really like the "use-package" syntax for :bind and :map.
Apr 12 20:11:01 <tobiasBora>	Is it possible to use this syntax also for code that is not a package?
Apr 12 20:14:58 <M4rkD>	Yeah, to be honest bpalmer, as someone new to all this - it sounds to me like an all-round painful approach to take. R
Apr 12 20:15:06 <M4rkD>	:)
Apr 12 20:15:48 <M4rkD>	Maybe it isn't so bad when you know what you're doing. :)
Apr 12 20:17:03 <ekleog>	Is there a way to have (ansi-)term kill its buffer when the process exits?
Apr 12 20:17:04 <M4rkD>	I do like that the buffer you see is what you save, and also what you see if you ever venture to another editor. That is awesome.
Apr 12 20:18:15 <ayuce>	tobiasBora: hello, doc says no.
Apr 12 20:18:29 <M4rkD>	But reopening a file for complex-ish mode, and reliably reparsing the contents...
Apr 12 20:19:32 <M4rkD>	Anyways, probably something that gets easier with a bit of experience....
Apr 12 20:20:25 <M4rkD>	Anyways, thanks for taking the time to share some thoughts bpalmer. Very appreciated.
Apr 12 20:26:15 <tobiasBora>	ayuce: too bad... Thanks

Apr 12 20:46:32 <Aurora-Sensei>	ts
Apr 12 20:50:16 <noobly>	does emacs calc not have a built in tool for computing limits? 
Apr 12 20:51:50 <Aurora-Sensei>	It might have something in symbolic mode
Apr 12 20:52:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	Ah, nvm.
Apr 12 20:52:48 <Aurora-Sensei>	It truly seems to lack it.
Apr 12 20:53:01 <Aurora-Sensei>	That's an interesting limitation.
Apr 12 20:53:17 <noobly>	that's so odd, it has derivatives, integrals, summations, etc.. I wonder why it lacks limits
Apr 12 20:53:30 <noobly>	Aurora-Sensei: nice pun :^)
Apr 12 20:53:40 <Aurora-Sensei>	noobly: Unintended, but indeed.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	It's moreso interesting because limits are kind of essention to both integration and derivation.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <Aurora-Sensei>	*essential
Apr 12 20:54:46 <noobly>	that's my thinking too, i wsa unsure if maybe the limit functionality was there as a subset of some other functionality, but if so i can't find it
Apr 12 20:55:41 <Aurora-Sensei>	I think it might qualify for filing a bug. 
Apr 12 20:58:08 <Misha_B>	lets implement spiders in emacs, to catch all the bugs
Apr 12 20:59:46 <Aurora-Sensei>	Might not the code get caught in their webs?
Apr 12 21:12:45 <Misha_B>	just lube the code up with some lard
Apr 12 21:15:12 <aidalgol>	Don't do that.  It'll break the condom.
Apr 12 21:25:17 *	Aurora-Sensei snerk
Apr 12 22:08:53 <klay>	Morning
Apr 12 22:09:19 <aidalgol>	Aurora-Sensei: Nothing to do with Emacs, but have you considered Sage if you're after a CAS?
Apr 12 22:11:48 <klay>	I'm sorry for a stupid question, but how I can compare a symbol with a result of `make-symbol'?  I was surpised '(equal (make-symbol "foo") 'foo)' is nil :-/
Apr 12 22:13:19 <jfb4>	,channel-wisdom
Apr 12 22:13:21 <fsbot>	email at least has a spec; blogs just have "various objections to dave winer"
Apr 12 22:13:31 <aidalgol>	I think this has something to do with symbol interning, which I have never fully understood
Apr 12 22:14:36 <edgar-rft>	klay: (equal (symbol-name 'foo) (symbol-name (make-symbol "foo"))
Apr 12 22:15:02 <klay>	Oh
Apr 12 22:15:27 <klay>	edgar-rft: Thank you!
Apr 12 22:15:30 <edgar-rft>	klay: but note that these are still two different symbols with the same name
Apr 12 22:15:43 <aidalgol>	wtf?
Apr 12 22:15:48 <klay>	omg
Apr 12 22:16:10 <aidalgol>	,(equal 'foo 'foo)
Apr 12 22:16:11 <fsbot>	t  ..(symbol)
Apr 12 22:16:22 <aidalgol>	oh, right, make-symbol actually *makes a new symbol*
Apr 12 22:16:27 <aidalgol>	AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!
Apr 12 22:16:30 <aidalgol>	whyyyyy?
Apr 12 22:16:36 <jfb4>	klay: see C-h S make-symbol 
Apr 12 22:16:40 <technomancy>	I think that means that you just shouldn't use make-symbol at all?
Apr 12 22:16:54 <technomancy>	intern is usually what I use to go from string->symbol, in the rare cases where that's needed
Apr 12 22:16:55 <jfb4>	technomancy: I believe it's used by gensym
Apr 12 22:17:02 <edgar-rft>	aidalgol: because make-symbol returns an uninterned symbol
Apr 12 22:17:10 <technomancy>	jfb4: makes sense, but then ... just use gensym =)
Apr 12 22:17:15 <aidalgol>	This isn't a problem in scheme, is it?
Apr 12 22:17:47 <technomancy>	no, because hygiene is so confusing in scheme that you just don't bother writing macros at all
Apr 12 22:18:12 <edgar-rft>	aidalgol: no, because Scheme doesn't have make-symbol :-)
Apr 12 22:18:13 <Aurora-Sensei>	aidalgol: I haven't needed CAS in a while, but yes, I'm aware of Sage. I used Maxima at the time though.
Apr 12 22:18:32 <klay>	jfb4: Got it, thank you
Apr 12 22:18:35 <aidalgol>	technomancy: You find defsyntax confusing?
Apr 12 22:18:38 <aidalgol>	er, define-syntax
Apr 12 22:18:44 <aidalgol>	*More* confusing than defmacro?
Apr 12 22:19:01 <technomancy>	aidalgol: oh yeah, way more confusing. defmacro is trivial.
Apr 12 22:19:16 <aidalgol>	Also, isn't it only confusing in scheme because CL and elisp don't even bother with hygiene?
Apr 12 22:19:23 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Huh... defmacro breaks my brain.
Apr 12 22:20:04 <aidalgol>	Then again, you are an alien hacker from a distant exoplanet.
Apr 12 22:20:25 <technomancy>	aidalgol: Scheme found one very complex way to avoid symbol capture, where elisp and CL just say "be careful and don't make mistakes"; meanwhile clojure and fennel have very simple ways to avoid symbol capture without complicating things.
Apr 12 22:20:45 <Aurora-Sensei>	Hy uses much the same way as Clojure.
Apr 12 22:20:56 <technomancy>	(they taint symbols which come from backtick and refuse to allow them to be used as identifiers)
Apr 12 22:21:41 <technomancy>	when you look at the incredible hoops scheme has to jump thru to achieve the same results, it really looks like a judo move that gets you 98% of the benefit with 5% of the effort.
Apr 12 22:22:51 <jfb4>	technomancy: a glance at the emacs source shows many uses of make-symbol, but spot-checking about 5 they are all in some variation of defmacro. must be some deep reason 
Apr 12 22:22:55 <aidalgol>	Sounds like Clojure has some really neat ideas.  Shame it exists in such a corporate ecosystem that lacks the same free-software spirit.
Apr 12 22:23:43 <technomancy>	aidalgol: luckily that idea is easy to steal =)
Apr 12 22:23:47 <klay>	Aha!  It works!  Thank you guys
Apr 12 22:24:28 <klay>	Now I have ‘(completing-read "Tags frontend: " '(ggtags rtags disable))’ in my custom defun and just `pcase' to compare
Apr 12 22:43:16 <quiliro>	I saw someone asked how to command mpv to play a video link. I read browse-url-of-dired-file was suggested. But that tryes to open lynx. How can I make it run mpv --ytdl-format=best URL_at_point
Apr 12 22:43:17 <quiliro>	?
Apr 12 22:44:11 <quiliro>	Changing shr-external-browser to mpv --ytdl-format=best
Apr 12 22:44:12 <quiliro>	?
Apr 12 22:44:34 <Aurora-Sensei>	Select it "m-x |" urxvt -e mpv - ?
Apr 12 22:44:44 <rrix>	you can customize browse-url-browser-function 
Apr 12 22:45:21 <Aurora-Sensei>	Hm, seems not tow ork, unfortuante, nevermind.
Apr 12 22:47:12 <rrix>	how would i go about resetting current-idle-time, it seems like the only things that do are in C source code? I am sick of EXWM not resetting idle time when I am typing in to a window
Apr 12 22:50:23 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Is it possible to steal in racket, or is it too low-level to retrofit onto an existing lisp?
Apr 12 22:51:37 <dmartincy>	I have a regular expression written in an Elisp file. If I do (buffer-substring-no-properties BEG END) I get a regexp that is escaped, so if pass that to another function that receives a regexp, the result is wrong. Is there any way I can get the unescaped regexp from the Elisp buffer so that I can pass it to other functions and get the expected result?
Apr 12 22:51:57 <technomancy>	aidalgol: technically speaking you could definitely add it to racket; socially speaking everyone will shun you because they value macro hygiene way too much.
Apr 12 22:52:10 <technomancy>	well, not shun, but ... laugh awkwardly when you bring the topic up and quickly move on to something else?
Apr 12 22:52:17 <technomancy>	racketeers are too nice to shun
Apr 12 22:54:06 <wrycode>	the racket crowd is indeed very friendly 
Apr 12 22:54:25 <wrycode>	are?
Apr 12 22:55:34 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Doesn't that still count as hygiene, just in a different way?
Apr 12 22:56:05 <technomancy>	aidalgol: that's not an unreasonable argument, but I don't think schemers see it that way
Apr 12 22:56:26 <technomancy>	for one thing it's easy to bypass intentionally (but hard to bypass by accident)
Apr 12 22:57:18 <aidalgol>	right
Apr 12 22:57:20 <nikitam>	So I'm having a brainfart moment once more. I'm trying to build from source. INSTALL says to ./configure in the source dir but it doesn exist.
Apr 12 22:57:29 <aidalgol>	not a hill I care to die on. :)
Apr 12 23:01:10 <rrix>	eugh, why is timer_start_idle not exported to elisp?
Apr 12 23:01:40 <nikitam>	https://pastebin.com/knA5JCpZ
Apr 12 23:03:47 <ayuce>	you should run autogen.sh first
Apr 12 23:03:51 <sam_c>	nikitam: you often need autogen.sh
Apr 12 23:05:15 <nikitam>	Cool, thanks.
Apr 12 23:11:03 <quiliro>	eww
Apr 12 23:11:06 <quiliro>	sorry
Apr 12 23:52:06 <bpalmer>	dmartincy: can you show an example? I suspect you're misinterpreting something.
Apr 12 23:53:15 <bpalmer>	(But maybe I am guessing too much at what the issue is; an example would help check)
Apr 12 23:57:53 <angelo__>	where is the whitespace.el located ? i see it only in the emacs sources. Is it possible to modify it ?
Apr 12 23:58:58 <dmartincy>	bpalmer: For example, an Elisp file may have the regexp "\\(Hello\\)". I want to extract that and pass it to a function like (xr-pp) to get (group "Hello") as a result. The problem is, if I use (buffer-substring-no-properties), what it really passes is (xr-pp "\\\\(Hello\\\\)"), which is a different thing.
Apr 12 23:59:06 <wgreenhouse>	angelo__: you can always make your own copy and put it somewhere in load-path
Apr 12 23:59:29 <angelo__>	wgreenhouse, ah ok. I try.
Apr 12 23:59:32 <angelo__>	thanks
Apr 12 23:59:42 <wgreenhouse>	yw
Apr 13 00:00:22 <dmartincy>	bpalmer: I think I need to use the (read) function or a variation so that it works on the text representation of the regular expression. Am I correct?
Apr 13 00:09:38 <epony>	"n|m" dashes in URLs considered harm%E2%80%93furll (tried to report it in #org-mode but nobody can fix it).. so if anyone uses Emacs org-mode, a normal dash (minus) between normal (lisp) brackets breaks the hyperlink parser
Apr 13 00:18:26 <zfnmxt>	Is there a nice way to see keybindings within emacs when using 'evil-collection'? When I do something like 'C-h m' I just get the emacs bindings.
Apr 13 00:21:09 <Profpatsch>	In haskell-mode, something is blocking for like 500ms ever few edits.
Apr 13 00:21:31 <Profpatsch>	Is there a view where you can see what is blocking the editor at the moment?
Apr 13 00:24:25 <Profpatsch>	Or just trace everything that happens after I hit a key, until the editor is listening for inputs again?
Apr 13 00:31:37 <dale>	Profpatsch: You can set debug-on-quit to t (or M-x toggle-debug-on-quit) and then C-g to try and interrupt whatever is blocking, hopefully dropping you into the debugger.
Apr 13 00:54:15 <Profpatsch>	Hm, sounds like a plan
Apr 13 01:05:33 <scheming_around>	Is there a method to use use-package with scripts such as this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColumnMarker
Apr 13 01:12:15 <dale>	scheming_around: If you download the Elisp (files) and put them on load-path, you can probably just load it normally with use-package.  You could use something like https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package to install them directly from the wiki, I think there are mixed feelings in the community about doing that.
Apr 13 01:19:51 <clmg>	How can I improve the performance of emacsclient? I don't mean the server, but the actual client frame initialization.
Apr 13 01:20:43 <jamzattack>	Use --with-x-toolkit=no instead of gtk
Apr 13 01:20:56 <clmg>	I use terminal emacs
Apr 13 01:21:37 <clmg>	There's about 1 second between running `emacsclient -nw .` and being able to actually see the dired buffer.
Apr 13 01:21:44 <nikitam>	I do not envy terminal emacs maybe because I couldn't comforably set it up in gentoo.
Apr 13 01:22:12 <nikitam>	It made clunking around the OS much easier, though. clmg: what's your window manager?
Apr 13 01:22:27 <clmg>	karmen: http://karmen.sourceforge.net/
Apr 13 01:23:11 <nikitam>	That looks like Mac OS 7
Apr 13 01:23:42 <nikitam>	It's probably super simple and minimal, I bet.
Apr 13 01:23:43 <jamzattack>	Looks just like twm
Apr 13 01:24:00 <clmg>	I love it. It has served me well for ~3 years
Apr 13 01:24:58 <nikitam>	It says Wind has superceded it, 6 years ago. Any huge difference?
Apr 13 01:25:49 <jamzattack>	Speaking of, does anyone know a WM that can launch another WM?  twm and ratpoison are the only ones that I know
Apr 13 01:25:57 <clmg>	I haven't tried wind.
Apr 13 01:26:07 <nikitam>	xdm?
Apr 13 01:26:21 <technomancy>	jamzattack: awesome does, I think
Apr 13 01:26:47 <clmg>	xdm is great
Apr 13 01:27:44 <nikitam>	I'm sad I had to scrap my gentoo. I learned a lot.
Apr 13 01:28:09 <jamzattack>	but xdm doesn't let you keep the same programs open, does it?
Apr 13 01:28:22 <nikitam>	I had to prioritize getting proprietary software to work for school so I had to choose between Redhat and Debian.
Apr 13 01:29:02 <nikitam>	jamzattack: Not to my knowledge. I think you can just use it alone or delegate the task to another wm.
Apr 13 01:29:19 <rwp>	jamzattack, Don't you just exit or kill one window manager and then just start another to switch?
Apr 13 01:30:14 <rwp>	That's the way I have always done it.  With the typical window manager system.  Not with the heavier Desktop Environments.
Apr 13 01:30:34 <nikitam>	rwp: I wonder how complex it would be to have all your window sessions persist in something heavy.
Apr 13 01:31:10 <rwp>	What fails to "persist"?
Apr 13 01:31:49 <rwp>	I mean if I have Firefox open, a dozen xterms, Emacs, and a dozen other random X programs, those all persist, right?
Apr 13 01:31:53 <nikitam>	Open applications, perhaps. If the processes keep running and one has enough RAM it seems feasible.
Apr 13 01:37:26 <spikemaster>	ratpoison
Apr 13 01:38:49 <nikitam>	spikemaster: This looks cool.
Apr 13 01:39:49 <jamzattack>	Yeah I usually start twm or ratpoison and switch to EXWM, just wondering if there was another floating wm that does this so that I can get back to tty without manually killing Xorg 
Apr 13 01:41:40 <nikitam>	Don't most systems have a set of getty sessions open on boot?
Apr 13 01:42:19 <nikitam>	I guess I'm getting my head scrambled between OpenRC and Systemd
Apr 13 01:51:50 <clmg>	Is there a way to get tint2 to draw without having a wm window?
Apr 13 02:00:28 <grym>	i just picked up i3
Apr 13 02:00:31 <grym>	so far so good 
Apr 13 02:06:14 <aidalgol>	I tried Marathon yesterday.  It has not aged well.
Apr 13 02:10:19 <technomancy>	aidalgol: the second and third feel a lot smoother imo

Apr 16 16:43:24 <rpav>	any idea why set-window-buffer would switch multiple windows unless i call message after? :P 
Apr 16 16:43:56 <rpav>	but only if that window is not current
Apr 16 16:44:07 <rpav>	and note, the current window is not the one also switched
Apr 16 16:46:08 <rpav>	(nevermind, it was as ridiculously unlikely as it seemed)
Apr 16 16:46:31 <hodapp>	hm, I guess org-match-sparse-tree doesn't really do what I want. I might have to roll some makeshift org parsing to do this myself
Apr 16 16:47:25 <lampilelo>	rpav: stars aligned in a specific way for a moment or someone targetted you with M-x butterfly
Apr 16 16:48:19 <rpav>	lampilelo: or i was just dumb ;)
Apr 16 17:00:23 <neuro_sys>	Is there a bitmap/raster graphics API within Emacs that I can use with Elisp to draw graphics?
Apr 16 17:00:31 <codingquark>	wasamasa: apparently, if I do (set-frame-font "Noto Color Emoji-13" t (frame-list)), only emojis display, and everything else becomes boxes
Apr 16 17:00:32 <codingquark>	lol
Apr 16 17:00:43 <wasamasa>	but are they colorful?
Apr 16 17:00:46 <wasamasa>	neuro_sys: no
Apr 16 17:00:55 <codingquark>	wasamasa: yes, very colorful
Apr 16 17:01:06 <wasamasa>	neuro_sys: the best you can do is creating svg using your preferred xml API
Apr 16 17:01:32 <wasamasa>	or you can mess around with xpm/xbm the hard way :D
Apr 16 17:02:17 <neuro_sys>	I think this one is using xbm https://github.com/chuntaro/epaint
Apr 16 17:02:36 <wasamasa>	I mean, consider for a moment what emacs is
Apr 16 17:02:49 <wasamasa>	and compare with smalltalk IDEs
Apr 16 17:03:02 <wasamasa>	unlike emacs they've bootstrapped their own GUI stuff from the absolute basics
Apr 16 17:03:03 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm. Running daemonized Emacs means it cannot access my ssh-agent which I run from graphical session. What do you suggest?
Apr 16 17:03:09 <codingquark>	wasamasa: was this the goal of the experiment? :-P
Apr 16 17:05:46 <stepnem>	wasamasa, neuro_sys: there's svg.el (built-in)
Apr 16 17:07:26 <codingquark>	I tried setting noto color emoji as fallback fonts for utf-8 but emacs decided to use symbola anyway
Apr 16 17:07:32 <codingquark>	^.^
Apr 16 17:07:44 <wasamasa>	stepnem: svg.el is an example of creating svg using your preferred xml api
Apr 16 17:07:58 <wasamasa>	stepnem: there's nothing revolutionary in it
Apr 16 17:14:00 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	Hm, guess I'll just have to manually set those on the daemon when I restart it.
Apr 16 17:14:09 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	(ssh-agent env-vars)
Apr 16 17:20:40 <lxsameer>	hey folks, what is the correct way to fix `Warning: assignment to free variable` on compile time ? (eval-when-compile (defvar that-var)) ?
Apr 16 17:21:59 <wasamasa>	declare it
Apr 16 17:22:08 <wasamasa>	not at compile time, that's bollocks
Apr 16 17:22:31 <wasamasa>	if it's only dynamically bound, you can omit the value
Apr 16 17:23:17 <lxsameer>	wasamasa:cool thanks man 
Apr 16 17:25:04 <codingquark>	How many hours of AC do you guys use?
Apr 16 17:25:11 <wasamasa>	0

Apr 16 17:25:33 <codingquark>	Is it cold right now there?
Apr 16 17:26:03 <codingquark>	It gets 42°C here BTW
Apr 16 17:26:25 <wasamasa>	it's 27C right now, so I've opened the windows
Apr 16 17:27:40 <codingquark>	27 is nice!
Apr 16 17:27:50 <codingquark>	Kinda too cold for me, I love ~30
Apr 16 17:27:53 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 16 17:28:15 <codingquark>	Above 32 I start feeling uncomfortable, TBH
Apr 16 17:28:19 <wasamasa>	the room is somewhere between 25 and 30 degrees when the sun shines
Apr 16 17:28:39 <wasamasa>	in winter times it's considerably cooler and I occasionally need to turn on the heating
Apr 16 17:28:53 <codingquark>	Can you sit under directly sunlight when it is 25-30?
Apr 16 17:29:13 <codingquark>	*under direct sunlight
Apr 16 17:29:35 <codingquark>	Clearly, my brain is undergoing a memory corruption and page restoration phase
Apr 16 17:29:48 <lxsameer>	wasamasa: by declare it did you mean using the declare macro ?
Apr 16 17:29:57 <wasamasa>	no, I mean defvar
Apr 16 17:30:04 <wasamasa>	it can declare and initialize variables
Apr 16 17:30:09 <npostavs>	Aurora_iz_kosmos: the ssh-agency package (which I wrote) attempts to figure out the env settings automatically

Apr 16 22:59:19 <wasamasa>	microsoft doesn't do reproducible builds and adds tracking to their official releases
Apr 16 22:59:30 <bpalmer>	Sure. the AGPL is kind of terrible.
Apr 16 22:59:32 <wasamasa>	apple banishes GPL software from their installation
Apr 16 23:00:02 <wasamasa>	I see plenty of reasons why they have influence over the public perception of licensing and what's OK to do there
Apr 16 23:00:09 <bpalmer>	an OS that comes from a *BSD tradition uses non-GPL software? I'm shocked.
Apr 16 23:00:33 <wasamasa>	GPL3 stuff only though
Apr 16 23:01:01 <wasamasa>	it's kind of sad to see new code that uses this as reason to have regressed to old elisp requirements
Apr 16 23:02:25 <hodapp>	okay, apparently I misunderstood the purpose of org-element-interpret-data
Apr 16 23:03:05 <hodapp>	http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_parse_org_mode.html says it's the reverse of org-element-parse-buffer but it's not clear to me what the point is of the strings it returns
Apr 16 23:03:52 <patricles>	do gwene.org users ever find their feeds getting stuck? i have one that seems to only update extremely rarely, even though the derived RSS feed is updating
Apr 16 23:04:08 <wasamasa>	hodapp: can you replace buffer text with that string?
Apr 16 23:04:33 <patricles>	also, yeah, apple sucks. zsh by default is messing up some workshops i teach, or at least causing a distraction
Apr 16 23:04:39 <hodapp>	wasamasa: I'm really not sure.
Apr 16 23:06:23 <wasamasa>	I've done my first dist-upgrade and things didn't fall apart (yet)
Apr 16 23:07:11 <wasamasa>	cryptsetup works now, I'll have to figure out an appropriate nfs setup/script
Apr 16 23:08:11 <wasamasa>	tomorrow
Apr 16 23:12:34 <hodapp>	stringp returns t, 'length' returns something short, but it prints out as #("foo" 0 4 (:parent (paragraph (:begin.... blahblahblahblah) for a much longer length and I have no idea what I'm even looking at
Apr 16 23:12:59 <hodapp>	where "foo" is what I'd expect for the string representation, but what is all this other stuff
Apr 16 23:13:18 <daniele->	hodapp: text properties
Apr 16 23:13:24 <ayuce>	patricles: that's the case, yes.
Apr 16 23:13:47 <hodapp>	daniele-: okay, thanks.
Apr 16 23:14:05 <daniele->	patricles: does the last macos have zsh by default?
Apr 16 23:17:28 <shukryzablah>	is there a way to get a todo list of only tasks that have no children? 
Apr 16 23:17:29 <shukryzablah>	in orgmode
Apr 16 23:27:38 <spikemaster>	yes, what i mean is the "or later" in the license. Could someone introduce bad non-free stuff into GPLv4?
Apr 16 23:31:56 <rpav>	spikemaster: that always annoyed me, though i *think* i saw recently there was wording about being "in the same spirit," but, i'm not sure and that's not necessarily much of a guarantee
Apr 16 23:31:58 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	I'd presume yes.
Apr 16 23:32:36 <Aurora_iz_kosmos>	That becomes debating the spirit of it.
Apr 16 23:33:35 <rpav>	like say 50 years from now, Dick Stallman II, son of Richard, controls the FSF, and is evil, and writes the GPL v5 to be "i own all your stuff and can do whatever i want"
Apr 16 23:35:12 <xristos>	i don't think RMS is big on procreation
Apr 16 23:35:54 <sybariten>	Aoooooo
Apr 16 23:37:09 <rpav>	heh
Apr 16 23:37:10 <epony>	no need to, many other clones
Apr 16 23:37:29 <epony>	(and deposits for anonymous replication)
Apr 16 23:37:58 <epony>	xristos, hope you did not put much thought intoo that :-)
Apr 16 23:38:21 <spikemaster>	if microsoft buys the FSF, then introduces GPLv4, they could inject a licence virus into Emacs since it is "or later".
Apr 16 23:39:41 <epony>	edit: when msft adopts gnu licensing model..
Apr 16 23:39:49 <daniele->	spikemaster: please go read the statute of the free software foundation
Apr 16 23:44:35 <epony>	"it only misreads"
Apr 16 23:47:51 <bandali>	spikemaster, what daniele- said
Apr 16 23:47:55 <bandali>	the fsf can do no such thing
Apr 16 23:48:08 <bandali>	there was recent discussion about this in #gnu or #fsf i don't recall which
Apr 16 23:55:03 <giorgian>	After removing tons of stuff, it would appear that w3 breaks links formatting in org-mode. 
Apr 16 23:56:45 <giorgian>	Now my emacs starts in very little time.

Apr 17 11:08:57 <codingquark>	I was going to write an elisp function to start syncthing with a key binding in exwm. But then I thought "Oh wait, this should be a systemd user service". And that is how, I saved my day.
Apr 17 11:43:19 <fivo>	Anybody using flycheck?
Apr 17 11:44:01 <codingquark>	,anyone
Apr 17 11:44:02 <fsbot>	Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help. https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html
Apr 17 11:51:41 <fivo>	Flycheck works, but next-error doesn't as it complains with 'No more Flycheck errors' even thought there are clearly errors visible in the current buffer.
Apr 17 12:07:10 <stepnem>	fivo: It doesn't wrap. Try `previous-error'. :-D
Apr 17 12:09:04 <fivo>	stepnem: no luck with that, same message
Apr 17 12:10:06 <stepnem>	fivo: What does "there are clearly errors visible" mean, then? Also, how about `flycheck-list-errors'?
Apr 17 12:12:15 <afidegnum>	hell, this doesn't work for me. (s-split "\\_" "1_2.3")
Apr 17 12:14:47 <wasamasa>	it turns out adding backslashes isn't always helpful
Apr 17 12:15:23 <wasamasa>	what do you expect these backslashes to do?
Apr 17 12:17:25 <afidegnum>	ok, this works (split-string "foobar_baz" "_")
Apr 17 12:17:54 <wasamasa>	I second not using s and f if you can help it
Apr 17 12:17:59 <wasamasa>	most of it is trivial wrappers
Apr 17 12:19:00 <afidegnum>	ok,
Apr 17 12:19:06 <afidegnum>	but this doesn't work 
Apr 17 12:19:10 <afidegnum>	(append '(split-string "foobar_baz" "_"))
Apr 17 12:19:17 <wasamasa>	why the quote?
Apr 17 12:19:17 <afidegnum>	,(append '(split-string "foobar_baz" "_"))
Apr 17 12:19:18 <fsbot>	(split-string "foobar_baz" "_")  ..(cons)
Apr 17 12:19:25 <wasamasa>	why append with a single argument?
Apr 17 12:19:43 <afidegnum>	the first form produce 2 lists
Apr 17 12:19:53 <wasamasa>	have you even looked at its docstring?
Apr 17 12:20:25 <afidegnum>	?
Apr 17 12:20:40 <afidegnum>	this is the initial result ("foobar" "baz")
Apr 17 12:20:46 <wasamasa>	I have the impression you're guessing what functions do instead of looking at their documentation
Apr 17 12:20:53 <wasamasa>	append is not a string processing function
Apr 17 12:21:01 <afidegnum>	ok
Apr 17 12:21:11 <wasamasa>	what do you want to do?
Apr 17 12:21:39 <afidegnum>	i want to have  ("foobarbaz")
Apr 17 12:21:49 <wasamasa>	a list of a string?
Apr 17 12:21:50 <afidegnum>	merging the list
Apr 17 12:22:35 <afidegnum>	yes
Apr 17 12:22:35 <wasamasa>	use mapconcat and surround the result with a list
Apr 17 12:23:06 <wasamasa>	or apply and concat
Apr 17 12:25:09 <afidegnum>	fron the definition mapconcat requires 2 arguments but this doesn't work either (mapconcat '(split-string "foobar_baz" "_"))
Apr 17 12:25:32 <wasamasa>	that's why you read the docstring
Apr 17 12:26:05 <wasamasa>	you're still quoting the split-string call for some inexplicable reason
Apr 17 12:26:16 <wasamasa>	do not do that
Apr 17 12:27:31 <bremner>	,shakespear
Apr 17 12:27:32 <fsbot>	bremner, hmm, shakespeare is http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/
Apr 17 12:28:06 <bremner>	a whole course on parsing. What a nightmare
Apr 17 12:28:37 <afidegnum>	wasamasa: no luck. (mapconcat (split-string "foobar_baz" "_") "") i tried other combinations too
Apr 17 12:28:46 <wasamasa>	...
Apr 17 12:28:53 <wasamasa>	let me know once you've read the docstring
Apr 17 12:29:09 <wasamasa>	programming is not a contest how much poo you can throw at the wall
Apr 17 12:29:57 <bremner>	,channel-wisdom is also  programming is not a contest how much poo you can throw at the wall
Apr 17 12:30:02 <fsbot>	Added note [203] for term "shit#emacssays"
Apr 17 12:31:32 <afidegnum>	this helped (string-join (split-string "foobar_baz" "_") "")
Apr 17 12:31:49 <wasamasa>	look at its definition
Apr 17 12:32:01 <wasamasa>	you may notice something useful
Apr 17 12:33:34 <afidegnum>	from what i red, it assign it to a symbol-name 
Apr 17 12:33:44 <afidegnum>	or am i not right?
Apr 17 12:33:52 <wasamasa>	I have no idea what you're talking about
Apr 17 12:34:00 <wasamasa>	the definition of string-join uses mapconcat
Apr 17 12:34:08 <afidegnum>	(mapconcat 'symbol-name '(The cat in the hat) " ")
Apr 17 12:34:13 <wasamasa>	it uses it not with one, not with two, but three arguments
Apr 17 12:35:11 <wasamasa>	the docstring explains what the three arguments expect and what they do
Apr 17 12:56:45 <lampilelo>	but is reading a docstring any fun?
Apr 17 13:01:13 <bremner>	adjusting for being #emacs, and local definition of fun, yes
Apr 17 13:02:50 <codingquark>	No
Apr 17 13:03:41 <rando25892>	,tropes
Apr 17 13:03:42 <fsbot>	<<firearms: List of firearm pairs>>
Apr 17 13:06:45 <rando25892>	always good to bring up key bindings never enough reminders
Apr 17 13:07:39 <rando25892>	i wrote a bunch of scripts to automate xterms prompts send and expect basically autofill my xinitrc with potential keybindings and or just basic sticky notes
Apr 17 13:08:02 <rando25892>	i think i wrote my first library
Apr 17 13:08:17 <rando25892>	which would be writing numbers in their english word like one two three
Apr 17 13:14:53 <contrapunctus[x]>	rando25892: you mean like the CL format ~R directive?
Apr 17 13:28:35 <rando25892>	that would work in  a bash script too then?
Apr 17 13:29:05 <rando25892>	cause i just take the ln number then thtat ll equal the written number
Apr 17 13:29:28 <rando25892>	which is the library i found and creating on my own hahaha
Apr 17 13:29:41 <wasamasa>	common lisp and unix don't mix
Apr 17 13:31:34 <rando25892>	i was so happy too cause i needed to seperate the number from my tests so that i could edit the xinitrc file accordingly to the prompt my script writes
Apr 17 13:39:22 <hodapp>	rudybot: what is the result of mixing Common Lisp and Unix?
Apr 17 13:39:46 <rudybot>	hodapp: embedding lisp into a unix-like shell is mixing oil and water imo.  hopeless.
Apr 17 13:41:58 <bremner>	,rash
Apr 17 13:41:59 <fsbot>	From memory, rash is RAcket SHell: https://docs.racket-lang.org/rash/index.html
Apr 17 13:42:14 <rpav>	dunno, if you don't try directly invoking CL from the shell for commands it works pretty well
Apr 17 13:42:16 <bpalmer>	you should see a doctor about that
Apr 17 13:42:28 <hodapp>	'Rash, adj 1. Hurrying into action or assertion without due caution and regardless of prudence, hasty, reckless, precipitate. “A rash programmer is likely to produce shell scripts.”' okay, okay, that was clever
Apr 17 13:43:36 <bpalmer>	the world is carried on the backs of 4 elephants on top of so much shell
Apr 17 13:44:03 <bremner>	it's reckless all the way down
Apr 17 13:45:44 <bpalmer>	rudybot: which is worse: buggy shell scripts or buggy C code?
Apr 17 13:45:46 <edgar-rft>	somewhere I read a story how Lisp computing was in the 1960s "we started in the morning and ccomputed until all memory was used up, then we started the garbage collector and went home because garbage collection would not be finished until late at night" what was one of the reasons for the unix "keep it small and simple" philosophy
Apr 17 13:45:48 <rudybot>	bpalmer: also blindly trusting stuff you're installing as root, which may have malicious, incompetent, or buggy post/pre scripts.
Apr 17 13:46:48 <hodapp>	rudybot: don't you run as root?
Apr 17 13:46:57 <rudybot>	hodapp: I don't think you're supposed to run Emacs as root.
Apr 17 13:47:13 <hodapp>	rudybot: quit evading the question. what is your UID?
Apr 17 13:47:14 *	edgar-rft becomes root and runs
Apr 17 13:47:14 <rudybot>	hodapp: but you appear to be evading the point with consummate skill 
Apr 17 13:47:17 <rando25892>	functions are my weakness
Apr 17 13:47:28 <rando25892>	but i do have one kick though bash aliases
Apr 17 13:47:39 <hodapp>	rudybot: oh, *I* am the one evading it?!
Apr 17 13:47:56 <rudybot>	hodapp: i can say i am neither jordanb nor xah nor anyone evading a ban
Apr 17 13:50:44 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: I would like to have a Common Lisp Unix coctail please
Apr 17 13:51:01 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: 46 <SamB> also, somebody please come up with an exploit for the "no traverse checking" thing? please?   -- what is traverse checking in unix?
Apr 17 13:52:21 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: your database is full of shit
Apr 17 13:52:22 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: yes, full fsyncing (F_FULLFSYNC etc) at regular intervals provides the security that all write():s to files have been synced to disk, this is a great basic security. now, is there anything we can do for 'higher-level' causes to database file corruption, such as a SIGSEGV right in the middle of sqlite3 doing a sequence of writes to key places in the db file?
Apr 17 14:06:51 <stsquad>	is there any way to get just the font locking parts of c-mode working, maybe as a minor mode so you can have highlighting of code in other major modes?
Apr 17 14:11:17 <wasamasa>	org does that with src blocks
Apr 17 14:17:25 <hrehf>	what's the best way to map over a list of tuples (ie lists) and use the sublists/tuples as arguments to another function?
Apr 17 14:17:42 <hrehf>	sortof like map-apply, but with arbitrary number of arguments (map-apply uses key/value as args)
Apr 17 14:18:25 <hrehf>	(map (lambda (args) (apply my-fun args)) list-of-args) would probably work, is there something better?
Apr 17 14:19:21 <wasamasa>	ITYM cl-map
Apr 17 14:19:43 <wasamasa>	there's at least cl-maplist
Apr 17 14:19:53 <wasamasa>	and a lot more under the cl-map prefix
Apr 17 14:22:13 <hrehf>	nice, thanks
Apr 17 14:44:44 <stsquad>	wasamasa: any idea where in org-mode it achieve the magic? the cc-mode functions seem very wedded to the idea of actually being cc-mode before you call them
Apr 17 14:45:52 <wasamasa>	it copies the block contents to a separate buffer, ensures they're fontified and copies them back
Apr 17 14:45:57 <wasamasa>	so nothing specific to cc-mode
Apr 17 14:48:10 <francisv-local>	Hi, I use Emacs 27, compiled from the git branch `emacs-27', commit `c36c5a3ded'.  I have problems using it with gnutls.  For example, if I do:

Apr 17 14:53:21 <saint->	Hi, I'm a vim user and I have a question about macros in emacs. If when you're recording a macro and you hit undo, is it possible to replay that macro without any issues? Meaning that undo doesn't undo the whole macro but just the part in the macro that you were changing
Apr 17 14:53:53 <wgreenhouse>	francisv-local: url-retrieve-synchronously doesn't return the result as a string, it redirects it to some buffer
Apr 17 14:54:39 <wgreenhouse>	francisv-local: so this seems like the expected result. all that comes through to Messages (or stdout if --batch) is messages generated by url.el along the way
Apr 17 14:54:56 <wgreenhouse>	you need to do your manipulations on the buffer where url-retrieve sent the result
Apr 17 14:55:23 <wgreenhouse>	,df url-retrieve-synchronously
Apr 17 14:55:24 <fsbot>	url-retrieve-synchronously is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
Apr 17 14:55:24 <fsbot>	‘url.el’.
Apr 17 14:55:24 <fsbot>	(url-retrieve-synchronously URL &optional SILENT INHIBIT-COOKIES
Apr 17 14:55:24 <fsbot>	TIMEOUT) ;;[ ,more / ,dump]

Apr 17 14:55:27 <fsbot>	Retrieve URL synchronously.
Apr 17 14:55:27 <fsbot>	Return the buffer containing the data, or nil if there are no data
Apr 17 14:55:27 <fsbot>	associated with it (the case for dired, info, or mailto URLs that need
Apr 17 14:55:29 <fsbot>	no further processing).  URL is either a string or a parsed URL. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 17 14:56:02 <francisv-local>	wgreenhouse: the result from the `google' package used to be entries in helm.
Apr 17 14:56:37 <francisv-local>	(not sure I am using the proper terminology with 'entries in helm')
Apr 17 14:56:51 <holomorph>	let's add curl.el to emacs
Apr 17 14:56:53 <wgreenhouse>	francisv-local: ok, I don't know anything about that package and don't use helm either, I'm just explaining that url-retrieve sounds like it's doing its job, and you need to go look at its output buffer to find the result of the query
Apr 17 14:56:54 <stsquad>	ahh so org-src-font-lock-fontify-block basically copies a region into a temp buffer and then sets the major mode and copies the result after fontification
Apr 17 14:57:04 <francisv-local>	I thought I had a problem with gnutls
Apr 17 14:57:16 <wgreenhouse>	francisv-local: you do not, there's no gnutls error in what you shared
Apr 17 14:57:56 <francisv-local>	wgreenhouse: Good to know that I should not look into problems with gnutls
Apr 17 14:58:23 <francisv-local>	wgreenhouse: Thank you.  I will see what else I can find out in that package.
Apr 17 14:58:28 <wgreenhouse>	ok, good luck
Apr 17 14:58:38 <francisv-local>	It is kind of old, probably the API of Google has simple changed.
Apr 17 14:58:47 <francisv-local>	s/simple/simply

Apr 17 15:47:45 <neuro_sys>	stsquad: Thanks, makes sense. I realized it allows passing in args to the callback, that's how I solved it. So I have to do with-current-buffer inside the timer callback _again_, in a sense.

Apr 17 18:47:55 <wasamasa>	yeah, no
Apr 17 18:48:05 <holomorph>	lol
Apr 17 18:48:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah wait, does that freeze everything?
Apr 17 18:48:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	...How annoying.
Apr 17 18:48:23 <contrapunctus[x]>	Aurora_v_kosmose: `run-at-time`
Apr 17 18:48:57 <refusenick>	wasamasa: Apparently, Mozilla's Servo (pure Rust replacement for Gecko) is designed to be used with different frontends. If Emacs supported sandboxing and Rust were free software (both bold propositions), that could make for a real browser inside Emacs.
Apr 17 18:48:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah, well that's nice.
Apr 17 18:49:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Rust is nonfree?
Apr 17 18:49:21 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: It has to do with trademarks.
Apr 17 18:49:27 <wasamasa>	classic mozilla
Apr 17 18:49:31 <refusenick>	They pulled the same shenanigans as they did with Firefox.
Apr 17 18:49:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah.
Apr 17 18:49:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ahh... that's familiar.
Apr 17 18:49:55 <codingquark>	What's up peeps
Apr 17 18:49:56 <refusenick>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_software_rebranded_by_Debian
Apr 17 18:49:58 <contrapunctus[x]>	So you can fork it if you rebrand it, say..."Dust"?
Apr 17 18:49:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And a rename wouldn't deal with that?
Apr 17 18:50:12 <wasamasa>	contrapunctus[x]: that would suggest its doom
Apr 17 18:50:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'd have gone with "Bust" for maximum laziness...
Apr 17 18:50:21 <refusenick>	https://wiki.hyperbola.info/doku.php?id=en:main:rusts_freedom_flaws
Apr 17 18:50:32 <contrapunctus[x]>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I totally wrote that and deleted it xD
Apr 17 18:50:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	contrapunctus[x]: heh
Apr 17 18:51:10 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Stick it atop GCC and add more C interop, call it Crust.
Apr 17 18:51:13 <wasamasa>	I mean, npm-style packaging, language churn and this trademark issue are all bad signs
Apr 17 18:51:33 <wasamasa>	but I still must keep my schadenfreude under control
Apr 17 18:51:53 <bremner>	Let's rewrite rustc in golang
Apr 17 18:52:23 <contrapunctus[x]>	refusenick: I wrote a time tracker for Emacs called Chronometrist. I'm working on a new feature - time goals. And then, I implemented timed alerts, to alert the user when they are 5 minutes away from the goal, when they have reached the goal, and when they have exceeded the goal by 5 minutes. And now I'd like to make that more flexible, so the user can set as many timed alerts as they like.
Apr 17 18:52:24 <codingquark>	,praise bremner
Apr 17 18:52:25 <fsbot>	16:75 To EMACS belong the secrets of the elispland and the editland.  The business of the Final Hour shall be accomplished in the twinkling of an eye, or even less.  EMACS has power over all things.
Apr 17 18:52:30 <refusenick>	bremner: That, my friend, is truely vile.
Apr 17 18:52:56 <wgreenhouse>	didn't mozilla settle the trademark dispute with debian over iceweasel etc.?
Apr 17 18:53:10 <codingquark>	rudybot: does emacs possess power over emacs?
Apr 17 18:53:13 <rudybot>	codingquark: 'While pursuing a shadowy genius (John Newton) and the dangerous, reality-bending power he may possess, private detective Hoyle (Kipleigh Brown) begins to sense her own reality coming apart in this black-and-white homage to noir crime thrillers of the 1940s'
Apr 17 18:53:47 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: have you looked at https://next.atlas.engineer/
Apr 17 18:54:02 <contrapunctus[x]>	Can Emacs create a mountain which Emacs itself cannot climb? Or create a sea so vast Emacs itself cannot cross?
Apr 17 18:54:15 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: essentially a browser consisting of a common lisp UI that talks to a qtwebengine rendering process
Apr 17 18:54:32 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: In 2017. It started in 2004. Point is, Mozilla can and will (ab)use the trademark clause.
Apr 17 18:54:45 <codingquark>	contrapunctus[x]: you can write a program that writes 1more byte than what it is about to read
Apr 17 18:56:09 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: I don't use a browser because I like it. That's what Emacs is for. If I'm going to pinch my nose and use the Web, it needs to "just werk". Even Firefox doesn't work sometimes, but it works enough that I use it anyways.
Apr 17 18:56:25 <refusenick>	I had lots of issues with nExt the last time I tried it.
Apr 17 18:57:35 <wasamasa>	yeah, it has a long way to go
Apr 17 18:57:51 <wasamasa>	its devs finally discovered that RPC isn't the best option for everything
Apr 17 18:58:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	How so?
Apr 17 18:58:24 <wasamasa>	there were platform-specific issues with finding the binaries to spawn
Apr 17 18:58:32 <bpalmer>	for all the complaints about rust's cargo following javascript's npm style packaging, elisp is going down that route as well.
Apr 17 18:58:40 <wasamasa>	they also had to change the mechanism because I egged someone into proving a security issue
Apr 17 18:58:56 <xristos>	bpalmer: parts of the community are going down that route
Apr 17 18:59:02 <xristos>	not everybody does
Apr 17 18:59:09 <wasamasa>	so it came as a surprise to me they're now doing FFI
Apr 17 18:59:22 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wasamasa: Ah. I see.
Apr 17 18:59:26 <refusenick>	wasamasa: Any idea for something which could fix Rust's flaws that you mentioned? I agree on all points, but I don't see another language which can manipulate memory safely (better than C/C++, anyways) and has a viable ecosystem. (not "piggyback off C", because that defeats the purpose)
Apr 17 18:59:30 <jgkamat>	oh, did they change again from dbus?
Apr 17 18:59:36 <wasamasa>	yes
Apr 17 19:00:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Probably helps it be a bit more portable.
Apr 17 19:00:02 <wasamasa>	jgkamat is that certain someone :>
Apr 17 19:00:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	RPC over sockets is one thing, dbus is a lot less portable.
Apr 17 19:00:23 <wasamasa>	refusenick: well, these flaws are a product of its community really
Apr 17 19:00:40 <wasamasa>	refusenick: the whole browser environment is high churn and obsession with miniscule packages
Apr 17 19:01:03 <wasamasa>	refusenick: whatever alternatives I propose have different origins and cultural values
Apr 17 19:01:16 <xristos>	it's low barrier to entry, you'd expect to see lots of noise
Apr 17 19:01:16 <bremner>	rudybot: I'll leftpad you in a minute
Apr 17 19:01:20 <rudybot>	bremner: loke`: https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/4bjss2/an_11_line_npm_package_called_leftpad_with_only/d19vysi
Apr 17 19:02:15 <jgkamat>	https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next/issues/671 O.O
Apr 17 19:02:29 <wasamasa>	welcome to lisp
Apr 17 19:02:42 <refusenick>	wasamasa: I'd rather have a fragmented ecosystem than segfaults galore. Maybe Rust could be compiled to Cyclone? They already did the hard part of verifying linearity. (well, affineness, which is a weaker condition)
Apr 17 19:03:05 <wasamasa>	there are less sexy languages giving you a better experience than C
Apr 17 19:03:36 <refusenick>	Cyclone is an extension to C with linear types and other niceties.
Apr 17 19:03:52 <wasamasa>	the algol family has many descendants
Apr 17 19:04:10 <refusenick>	Don't say Pascal, don't say Pascal... he's going to say Pascal.
Apr 17 19:04:11 <wasamasa>	look at those that don't resemble C
Apr 17 19:04:29 <wasamasa>	well, I thought rather of oberon, modula-3, ada
Apr 17 19:04:47 <wasamasa>	even fucking fortran is less of a pain with pointers
Apr 17 19:04:49 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ada has little ecosystem afaik.
Apr 17 19:04:58 <refusenick>	If we're going to ditch C's ecosystem, I'd make a clean break and ditch the Algol mistake entirely. A typed Forth would be nice.
Apr 17 19:05:06 <bremner>	yuck
Apr 17 19:05:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	A typed Lisp would be nice.
Apr 17 19:05:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So basically sbcl :p
Apr 17 19:05:20 <wasamasa>	you're being funny
Apr 17 19:05:22 <technomancy>	typed racket is a thing
Apr 17 19:05:24 <refusenick>	https://github.com/HackerFoo/poprc
Apr 17 19:05:27 <technomancy>	as you probably know
Apr 17 19:05:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Indeed.
Apr 17 19:05:57 <wasamasa>	then there's the ML family of languages
Apr 17 19:06:00 <technomancy>	although I kind of hate the use of the term "typed" to refer to "types known at compile time"
Apr 17 19:06:05 <wasamasa>	typically they involve GC though
Apr 17 19:06:11 <tromey>	I thought typed list was haskell
Apr 17 19:06:16 <tromey>	*lisp
Apr 17 19:06:19 <bremner>	no
Apr 17 19:06:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: So, the SBCL type-hints model?
Apr 17 19:06:34 <wasamasa>	type hints are not type checkers
Apr 17 19:06:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Indeed.
Apr 17 19:06:50 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I don't know anything about SBCL other than it's named after a bank, which is weird
Apr 17 19:06:51 <refusenick>	wasamasa: I thought we were talking about free competitors to Rust (and C and C++) - in other words, low-level memory management in one form or another.
Apr 17 19:07:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: That is weird.
Apr 17 19:07:20 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: its name is a riff on CMUCL
Apr 17 19:07:20 <technomancy>	if I had to pick, I'd prefer my lisp implementations to be named after crimes rather than instruments of capitalism, you know?
Apr 17 19:07:29 <wasamasa>	refusenick: well, I rather thought of programming languages lending themselves to large-scale programming, rather than the way too organic stuff made with lisp and forth
Apr 17 19:07:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And apparently, I was somewhat mistaken. Type declaration in CL is standard, not an extension.
Apr 17 19:07:45 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: as in carnegie (steel) and mellon (bank), to signal they're a fork of cmucl
Apr 17 19:07:54 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Well... you could argue that banks... :p
Apr 17 19:08:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Or that capitalism itself.
Apr 17 19:08:07 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: oh dang; good point
Apr 17 19:08:14 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: so a lisp named after a school that's named after a steel guy and a banker guy
Apr 17 19:08:15 <refusenick>	You could perhaps get away with an ML-family language without pointers like Rust or ATS if it has a sufficiently-smart region-based memory management system. (instead of a GC)
Apr 17 19:08:33 <wasamasa>	yes, I think that's something worth investigating
Apr 17 19:08:42 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: ah; makes a bit more sense, kinda?
Apr 17 19:08:48 <technomancy>	still weird
Apr 17 19:09:00 <wasamasa>	where do you think rust got its FP vibes from anyway
Apr 17 19:09:07 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I think the types stuff in CL is all about optimization, not correctness?
Apr 17 19:09:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: That's right.
Apr 17 19:09:26 <technomancy>	so only superficially related to typed racket
Apr 17 19:09:38 <refusenick>	Rust is an ML-family language with C++ syntax and RAII to handle the weakening (heh) of linear typing to affineness.
Apr 17 19:09:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Yeah. Security vs optimization is a tad different.
Apr 17 19:10:15 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: using overlapping technology to solve almost-completely unrelated problems
Apr 17 19:10:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yup.
Apr 17 19:11:22 <refusenick>	wasamasa: If you want a different perspective on programming in the large, consider Mercury. It's still in a research-stage level of development and nearly dead, but it has some things no other languages do.
Apr 17 19:11:49 <refusenick>	(and you need to know Prolog first to know what's going on)
Apr 17 19:13:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Ah. SBCL also considers type declarations to be assertions, which isn't mandated by the spec.
Apr 17 19:13:27 <wasamasa>	I for example have no hopes for CHICKEN being useful for programming in the large as long as its compiler takes noticable time to compile my small projects
Apr 17 19:13:27 <codingquark>	Rewrite exwm in sbcl thnkxbye
Apr 17 19:13:38 <wasamasa>	larger projects, RIP
Apr 17 19:13:47 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: there's always stumpwm
Apr 17 19:13:47 <bremner>	Aurora_v_kosmose: run time or compile time assertions?
Apr 17 19:14:03 <codingquark>	wgreenhouse: I use it when I'm not using exwm
Apr 17 19:14:08 <wgreenhouse>	codingquark: the problem with rewriting exwm in sbcl is that sbcl lacks a decent emacs
Apr 17 19:14:14 <codingquark>	:'D
Apr 17 19:14:29 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: https://blog.30dor.com/2014/03/21/performance-and-types-in-lisp/
Apr 17 19:15:03 <refusenick>	codingquark: Stumpwm?
Apr 17 19:15:20 <codingquark>	refusenick: yes, stumpwm
Apr 17 19:15:28 <refusenick>	so, stumpwm
Apr 17 19:15:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	bremner: runtime, so more like Racket contracts.
Apr 17 19:15:47 <codingquark>	refusenick: wgreenhouse mentioned it too just min ago :)
Apr 17 19:16:09 <wgreenhouse>	I vaguely wonder if they ever got around to fixing non-Latin character input in stumpwm
Apr 17 19:16:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	SBCLMAcs? :p
Apr 17 19:16:15 <wgreenhouse>	I had some bugs against it years ago
Apr 17 19:16:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(No)
Apr 17 19:16:28 <wgreenhouse>	oh. yay
Apr 17 19:16:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: I meant "no let's not make yet another Emacs fork"
Apr 17 19:16:45 <refusenick>	I've been up all night cajoling gccemacs into compiling and futzing about with numbers. Don't expect too much of me right now.
Apr 17 19:17:02 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: there is CLIMACS (emacs atop McCLIM). it is underwhelming
Apr 17 19:17:16 <technomancy>	oh man, mcclim
Apr 17 19:17:51 <technomancy>	I remember spending like ... a whole weekend trying to install mcclim because I heard about this browser written in CL and really wanted that to be a thing, and it crashed on the most basic pages
Apr 17 19:17:56 <technomancy>	(in 2005)
Apr 17 19:18:01 <xristos>	it's still the same
Apr 17 19:18:04 <wgreenhouse>	story checks out
Apr 17 19:18:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	kek
Apr 17 19:18:08 <wasamasa>	it's stable, not dead
Apr 17 19:18:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	hah
Apr 17 19:18:23 <wgreenhouse>	but remember, CL is the serious production Lisp
Apr 17 19:18:23 <codingquark>	technomancy: how are you coping with exwm? Any frictions worth mentioning after the long term relationship?
Apr 17 19:18:25 <holomorph>	like guilemacs??
Apr 17 19:18:25 <fsbot>	mu!
Apr 17 19:18:34 <technomancy>	codingquark: I'm never gonna give it up
Apr 17 19:18:35 <refusenick>	wasamasa: Stable vegetative state?
Apr 17 19:18:41 <technomancy>	never gonna let it down, or desert it
Apr 17 19:18:44 <lampilelo>	feature complete!
Apr 17 19:19:02 <codingquark>	That's some real love baby
Apr 17 19:19:33 <technomancy>	codingquark: well, we're no strangers to love
Apr 17 19:19:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Guile/Emacs is a nice idea though. If not ready.
Apr 17 19:19:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	You know the rules~
Apr 17 19:19:52 <technomancy>	rudybot: and so do I
Apr 17 19:19:54 <rudybot>	technomancy: I just feel that bored people can be creative if they're given information and the opportunity to do so.
Apr 17 19:20:11 <refusenick>	codingquark: The biggest block (pun intended) was updating packages. I installed paradox and enabled the async update option. Have only had sporadic freezes since.
Apr 17 19:20:20 <codingquark>	technomancy: good thing is, this one is ready to negotiate and find a middle ground 
Apr 17 19:20:35 <codingquark>	,paradox
Apr 17 19:20:35 <technomancy>	galaxy brain: don't install packages
Apr 17 19:20:36 <fsbot>	hmm, paradox is [0] https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox/
Apr 17 19:20:36 <fsbot>	[1] Improved package menu with github stars, extra commands and more!
Apr 17 19:20:58 <codingquark>	GitHub stars, who cares?
Apr 17 19:21:05 <refusenick>	(usually when I run out of RAM or run the CPU at max on my pre-2010 Thinkpad, both of which are almost always Firefox's fault)
Apr 17 19:21:06 <technomancy>	yeeeeeah that seems like a red flag tbh
Apr 17 19:21:22 <codingquark>	Indeed
Apr 17 19:21:37 <codingquark>	technomancy: sometimes I dream of installing all packages from Debian's repos and remove melpa
Apr 17 19:22:11 <technomancy>	codingquark: I get about half and half debian vs git subtree
Apr 17 19:22:22 <refusenick>	codingquark: I never enabled the stars anyways because you need an API key. `paradox-execute-asynchronously' is a godsend, though. Otherwise, Emacs is blocked while you update packages.
Apr 17 19:22:46 <codingquark>	Interesting, I shall take a look someday
Apr 17 19:22:51 <technomancy>	codingquark: almost all the non-debian packages I use are things that I actually hack on anyway, so I need a source checkout already https://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles/tree/master/.emacs.d/lib
Apr 17 19:22:52 <refusenick>	codingquark: Debian Stable? Testing?
Apr 17 19:23:01 <didi>	Uh, so Debian is discussing ditching email for a web forum, uh? I hope it's PHPBB.
Apr 17 19:23:02 <codingquark>	refusenick: stable, Deb10
Apr 17 19:23:07 <refusenick>	oof
Apr 17 19:23:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	didi: Dat so?
Apr 17 19:23:25 <refusenick>	Nothing in the repos is going to be remotely modern.
Apr 17 19:23:26 <codingquark>	technomancy: very interesting!
Apr 17 19:23:34 <codingquark>	I thought nobody actually does that sort of thing
Apr 17 19:23:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm not particularly enthused. Most forums lack APIs enabling use from Emacs.
Apr 17 19:24:01 <codingquark>	technomancy: a small set indeed
Apr 17 19:24:07 <technomancy>	5 packages I created myself, 3 that I've made significant contributions to, 3 that I just use and don't hack on
Apr 17 19:24:08 <refusenick>	I imagine you could get away with using only Arch packages if you don't install too many.
Apr 17 19:24:10 <didi>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Think about the users! Like moving to JS so all the kids can join.
Apr 17 19:24:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	didi: Give me a REST API and I'll be happy.
Apr 17 19:24:33 <codingquark>	Okay, let me try and see if I can switch from melpa to debian RIGHT NOW!
Apr 17 19:24:38 <bremner>	uhoh
Apr 17 19:24:43 <codingquark>	:'D
Apr 17 19:24:44 <refusenick>	Debian was the 1st distro I tried. What a meme recommendation. I switched to Manjaro because the packages just weren't there.
Apr 17 19:24:49 <didi>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I bet something can be hacked.
Apr 17 19:24:57 <codingquark>	bremner: wanna chip in bud?
Apr 17 19:25:03 <didi>	bremner: Do you have your forum banner ready?
Apr 17 19:25:05 <technomancy>	hm; apparently I don't even need s.el any more
Apr 17 19:25:10 <spikemaster>	i'm slowing converting all my elpa/melpa packages to git submodules.
Apr 17 19:25:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	didi: Not like the mailing-list server can't be hacked.
Apr 17 19:25:42 <refusenick>	Not that Debian is a meme distro, obviously, but recommending it to noobs is a dick move.
Apr 17 19:26:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If it doesn't support REST, that means messing around with xml/html parsing. Which is dull & annoying.
Apr 17 19:26:14 <hodapp>	will it run on GNU HURD?
Apr 17 19:26:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Is it?
Apr 17 19:26:54 <xristos>	spikemaster: only sane strategy if you have a lot of those and want to develop on the spot
Apr 17 19:27:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Manjaro breaks too often for me to recommend it to the technologically illiterate.
Apr 17 19:27:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And yes, I know, because I use it for gaming.
Apr 17 19:27:15 <refusenick>	> gaming
Apr 17 19:27:35 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Aye. Lutris works great.
Apr 17 19:28:07 <grym>	i think the notion that a distro's package manager is capable (or should be capable) of staying up to date on the latest and greatest is no longer really viable
Apr 17 19:28:10 <grym>	if it ever was 
Apr 17 19:28:13 <refusenick>	I don't know that I'd recommend Manjaro to a beginner. I certainly wouldn't recommend Ubuntu, knowing that they once tried loading Amazon spyware.
Apr 17 19:28:27 <spikemaster>	xristos: yes. using git for packages is perfect. I can have a remote to my fork, a remote to the origina upstream developers repo. Complete history. Branches. it's perfect and makes elpa/melpa packages look like a mikey mouse solution
Apr 17 19:28:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Most games without absurdly-annoying DRM/anti-cheat run just fine on Wine/Proton
Apr 17 19:28:33 <grym>	but like 2/3 of my tooling is by way of PPA or language-specific package managers
Apr 17 19:28:48 *	didi shivers at grym's tooling
Apr 17 19:28:51 <grym>	spikemaster: ever looked at straight? 
Apr 17 19:28:52 <xristos>	spikemaster: exactly
Apr 17 19:29:09 <grym>	didi: it's not my fault debian is idiotic about my main language 
Apr 17 19:29:12 <grym>	and emacs, for that matter
Apr 17 19:29:17 <xristos>	i looked at straight, found it ultra-overengineered, proceeded to keep using my own much simpler strategy
Apr 17 19:29:21 <didi>	grym: What's your main language?
Apr 17 19:29:24 <grym>	didi: python 
Apr 17 19:29:33 <grym>	and debian is totally braindead about python 
Apr 17 19:29:34 <didi>	grym: I use python. And I use Debian.
Apr 17 19:29:40 <grym>	didi: me too! 
Apr 17 19:29:44 <spikemaster>	i looked at straight breifly but didn't want to learn new things. I just prefer doign thigns my own way even if there's a bit of manual management.
Apr 17 19:30:03 <didi>	grym: It works fine to my.
Apr 17 19:30:06 <grym>	didi: i just don't use my OS's python. 
Apr 17 19:30:07 <refusenick>	I switched to Manjaro because it was the next recommendation I saw after Debian. I learned a lot that way, and stuck with it longer because A) its apps were modern enough to get work done and B) it looked a hell of a lot nicer than Debian (stupid, but that's what new users think about)
Apr 17 19:30:10 <didi>	grym: I do.
Apr 17 19:30:16 <grym>	didi: sorry to hear :) 
Apr 17 19:30:21 <didi>	grym: Why?
Apr 17 19:31:12 <grym>	because there's no good reason from a developer's perspective that i should have to apt install python3, python3-dev, python3-pip, python3-wheel, and a few others i think, to get what should come out of the box 
Apr 17 19:31:17 <grym>	so i don't
Apr 17 19:31:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I prefer Debian's managing of Python because I don't particularly like my chances of getting a https://thehackernews.com/2018/11/nodejs-event-stream-module.html incident  
Apr 17 19:31:42 <grym>	the OS python exists to do OS-stuff
Apr 17 19:31:44 <grym>	that's great
Apr 17 19:31:46 <didi>	grym: I don't understand. I write python programs.
Apr 17 19:32:00 <holomorph>	technomancy: what did s.el even do, anyways? i think i still use things that depend on dash… but have never bothered depending on it in my own code
Apr 17 19:32:05 *	holomorph googles
Apr 17 19:32:07 <refusenick>	grym: Aren't you the one who suggested to me to use pipx for Python cli apps and keep on using poetry for projects?
Apr 17 19:32:12 <grym>	refusenick: yes
Apr 17 19:32:14 <tromey>	wasn't s.el a string library
Apr 17 19:32:15 <refusenick>	I'm still on that setup. Works great.
Apr 17 19:32:18 <grym>	refusenick: awesome! 
Apr 17 19:32:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Depends on what you want for looks. I use i3wm on most things, so I don't see the difference.
Apr 17 19:32:43 <refusenick>	Only problem I've had so far is that pyls won't build in pipx.
Apr 17 19:32:51 <grym>	refusenick: hmm, that worked for me just fine 
Apr 17 19:32:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I might change my mind once I get large-enough monitors not to care about wasted space.
Apr 17 19:33:25 <grym>	refusenick: pipx install 'python-langauge-server[all]' , sadly. 
Apr 17 19:33:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Deepin looks very nice.
Apr 17 19:33:33 <grym>	pyls is the wrong name 
Apr 17 19:33:41 <grym>	iirc it's py2 only, so into the dustheap it goes
Apr 17 19:33:47 <technomancy>	holomorph: s.el is dash for strings, basically
Apr 17 19:34:03 <technomancy>	racket-mode used to use it, so I installed it. but latest racket-mode doesn't need it. so I can get my deps down to 10 =)
Apr 17 19:34:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Lots of nice utility functions.
Apr 17 19:34:12 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Yeah, but a noob doesn't know that. I installed Manjaro Deepin (which is apparently from China, so I wouldn't install it now) because I liked how it looked.
Apr 17 19:34:22 <holomorph>	tromey: yes. some of its things exist in subr-x now, but flipping through the readme is looks like it has some nice things
Apr 17 19:34:40 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: i just switched to i3 this week, which has been pretty eye-opening 
Apr 17 19:34:43 <holomorph>	s/things/extensions
Apr 17 19:34:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: I wouldn't tell a noob to start from scratch unless I provided them with a script to bootstrap things.
Apr 17 19:35:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Probably would have them go with KDE, it looks decent and lately runs okay.
Apr 17 19:35:55 <didi>	Uh, there's already an instance: https://discourse.debian.net/
Apr 17 19:36:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah goodness.
Apr 17 19:36:34 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: That's still more work than Manjaro. They offer prebuilt ISOs with different DEs, with pretty pictures and idiot-proof instructions for writing to and booting from a USB, at which point the well-done graphical installer takes care of the rest.
Apr 17 19:36:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	didi: That looks proprietary.
Apr 17 19:36:55 <didi>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I don't think it is.
Apr 17 19:37:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	didi: Ah nvm. I mangled the page by not loading its js
Apr 17 19:37:21 <refusenick>	I wish I could answer differently because Manjaro does have problems, but I can't think of another distro which is as beginner-friendly and doesn't have ulterior profit-seeking motives.
Apr 17 19:37:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah crud.
Apr 17 19:37:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	-_- It's that type of UI
Apr 17 19:37:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	i.e.: The same reason people learned ot use old.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com
Apr 17 19:37:51 <grym>	my first distro would've been i think redhat valhalla 
Apr 17 19:38:00 <didi>	Hey, according to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_%28software%29>, it's also a mailing list manager.
Apr 17 19:38:00 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: and install the firefox autoredirect 
Apr 17 19:38:16 <grym>	and right after valhalla i went to bootstrapping gentoo from stage 1 
Apr 17 19:38:22 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: The debian installer can do KDE though
Apr 17 19:38:25 <grym>	so... "into the deep end" is kind of my style
Apr 17 19:38:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: Ah, I use this userscript: https://discourse.debian.net/
Apr 17 19:38:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	...
Apr 17 19:38:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	clipboard
Apr 17 19:38:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	window.location = window.location.href.replace("www.reddit.com","old.reddit.com");
Apr 17 19:39:17 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Yeah, but it's ncurses-based. (or was, when I used it) That's already losing new users where Manjaro's fancy looks would keep them.
Apr 17 19:39:25 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-reddit-redirect/
Apr 17 19:39:32 <shukryzablah>	macs
Apr 17 19:39:45 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: but to be totally honest, 99% of my reddit time is in Apollo 
Apr 17 19:39:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: I don't like installing opaque extensions when a clean, simple & readable userscript does the job.
Apr 17 19:39:59 <codingquark>	Wait, exwm not available in debian repos?
Apr 17 19:40:19 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: kk
Apr 17 19:40:25 <wgreenhouse>	didi: aiui, Discourse is one of those things that tries to be both a forum and a mailinglist manager at the same time, doing both jobs badly
Apr 17 19:40:42 <refusenick>	I hate the new Reddit UI, but that's because I know how to better use plaintext. For most people, they click with their mice. So long as the text is big enough, the only relevant aspect of the UI is not having too many menus and options (which Debian has in spades) and looking good (Manjaro > Debian)
Apr 17 19:41:13 <didi>	wgreenhouse: Bummer.
Apr 17 19:41:13 <refusenick>	only relevant aspects of the UI are*
Apr 17 19:41:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: https://paste.debian.net/1141006/
Apr 17 19:41:26 <grym>	at this point 'looking good' is more or less the same thing as 'does it have a solarized theme'
Apr 17 19:41:43 <grym>	for me, anyway
Apr 17 19:42:36 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Those are way too bring most of the time. 
Apr 17 19:42:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	*bright
Apr 17 19:42:59 <refusenick>	grym: I mean "looking good" here as what a newcomer to Linux generally wants/expects (high definition Apple/Google look-a-like flat design)
Apr 17 19:43:18 <lampilelo>	i recently switched to one-themes, both dark and light look good
Apr 17 19:43:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	There's Elementary OS for that.
Apr 17 19:43:22 <refusenick>	GNU/Linux*
Apr 17 19:43:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	@ refusenick 
Apr 17 19:43:29 *	refusenick self-flagellates
Apr 17 19:44:12 <grym>	refusenick: in the face of ambiguity, refuse to guess :) 
Apr 17 19:44:15 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I understand that they made a company because it was easier to register than a non-profit, but that still makes me distrust.
Apr 17 19:44:36 <grym>	linux's UX problem, if it has one, is that there's a firm anti-consensus on look and feel _as_ the aesthetic
Apr 17 19:44:41 <grym>	this is more or less by design
Apr 17 19:44:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Fair, I guess.
Apr 17 19:45:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Discourse site says: > Anything you see on screen, you can also do via an API call. Discourse is a JavaScript app that talks to our Discourse API.
Apr 17 19:45:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	yay~
Apr 17 19:45:51 <refusenick>	I suppose that doesn't apply to Elementary (and the like) because they're not venture-backed and so don't have an incentive to strip mine their userbase for cash.
Apr 17 19:46:11 <refusenick>	(at least, they weren't the last time I checked)
Apr 17 19:47:36 <wgreenhouse>	grym: can you elaborate on that?
Apr 17 19:47:36 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So... the good news are it's possible to make a completely Emacs-friendly Discourse mode. The bad news are, it's a large-ish API.
Apr 17 19:47:46 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: old.reddit.com/r/unixporn
Apr 17 19:48:18 <wasamasa>	just make a gopher gateway :D
Apr 17 19:48:19 <refusenick>	I forgot, they have a consenus (i3-gaps MacOS copy)
Apr 17 19:48:37 <grym>	wgreenhouse: total freedom to choose, with decentralised choices about UX that are by project, means you will get a kind of  jumbled up and quirky overall effect.  you either like this (i do) or you don't, but there's no governing authority what's named jony ive who can dictate UX 
Apr 17 19:48:56 <grym>	wgreenhouse: it also means that the 16 standards problem is like, the air we breathe
Apr 17 19:49:05 <refusenick>	wasamasa: I already browse Pleroma at times via elpher. Is comfy.
Apr 17 19:49:41 <wgreenhouse>	grym: ah, yeah. I despise the many implementations of windowing in text-based applications that have buffers/windows, for example. it's one of the reasons I just try to live in emacs.
Apr 17 19:50:03 <wgreenhouse>	grym: there is nothing nice or quaint or fun for me about the constant context switching
Apr 17 19:50:17 <grym>	wgreenhouse: right, and you can ignore it if you choose 
Apr 17 19:51:01 <grym>	wgreenhouse: there's an analogy here with code autoformatters, come to think of it 
Apr 17 19:51:04 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Good point mentioning Elementary. I once knew a guy who was practically an evangelist for it. Maybe I'll have to pitch that instead of Manjaro if someone asks me which distro.
Apr 17 19:51:30 <grym>	"By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters."
Apr 17 19:51:35 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: iirc it's either Ubuntu or Debian based, which would make it relatively stable too.
Apr 17 19:51:40 <wasamasa>	refusenick: "Elementary, Watson!"
Apr 17 19:51:46 <grym>	just s/black/commercial-os-of-choice-here
Apr 17 19:53:17 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: It's Ubuntu-based, which still makes me biased against it tbh. PPAs are a lot more work for mundane installations compared to "everything in pacman, look in the AUR if it's not in the repo", but also don't break as easily AFAICT.
Apr 17 19:53:29 <refusenick>	I guess it depends on who I'm recommending it to.
Apr 17 19:53:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Mundane users are likely to just use snaps
Apr 17 19:54:43 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Which, or so I've heard from security people (don't remember which one), is a bad idea because Windows-style applications lead to Windows-style security holes.
Apr 17 19:54:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Of course.
Apr 17 19:55:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But there's no way to safely have up to date stuff and be ignorant at the same time.
Apr 17 19:55:44 <bremner>	and not pay someone to babysit your computer
Apr 17 19:56:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I suppose yes.
Apr 17 19:57:18 <refusenick>	bremner: Am I a sucker if I do it for free by getting them to install GNU/Linux so they use free software and do the work for them anyways?
Apr 17 19:57:25 <bremner>	yes
Apr 17 19:57:29 <refusenick>	:(
Apr 17 19:57:47 <bremner>	In late stage capitalism, you are either an exploiter or a sucker
Apr 17 19:58:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Eh, not necessarily. Subversive action requires ostensibly benevolent action.
Apr 17 19:58:12 <grym>	bremner: there's a third rail but it's tricky and involves goats
Apr 17 19:58:18 <bremner>	o.O
Apr 17 19:58:22 <didi>	Let's all be sucker wannabe exploiter.
Apr 17 19:58:22 <refusenick>	bremner: You say that as if it was supposed to be a joke.
Apr 17 19:58:35 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Viva la revolucion
Apr 17 19:58:35 <refusenick>	grym: I found black's boastful self-description as odiously pompous as I would expect a Python formatter selling itself on generic readability to be.
Apr 17 19:58:50 <grym>	refusenick: i use it every day and hook it on file save :P
Apr 17 19:59:00 <grym>	and think about what everyone's code looks like _never again_
Apr 17 19:59:05 <refusenick>	C++, I can understand a formatter to argue that it's generically better. Python? It's already readable.
Apr 17 19:59:18 <grym>	refusenick: don't make me do this :P
Apr 17 19:59:32 <grym>	refusenick: https://github.com/mahyarnajibi/SNIPER/blob/b048b19653abef72b1826e5d6c357e6fed7bf52e/lib/iterators/MNIteratorE2E.py#L117
Apr 17 19:59:34 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/TPoX4oWu1Z
Apr 17 19:59:36 <grym>	your move :D 
Apr 17 19:59:47 <refusenick>	I like APL
Apr 17 20:00:04 <grym>	so that should be triply painful then 
Apr 17 20:00:22 <grym>	ML people can't code straight to save their lives, i swear :( 
Apr 17 20:00:59 <refusenick>	Without resorting to numpy (which is what should've been used there, I presume), you can't get closer to APL than that in standard Python.
Apr 17 20:01:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: Not as bad as I expected. I expected nested comprehensions.
Apr 17 20:01:11 <grym>	that _is_ numpy :/ 
Apr 17 20:01:14 <grym>	it's numpy in a god-dict
Apr 17 20:01:25 <refusenick>	oh
Apr 17 20:01:30 <grym>	they're just idiots and dont' know how to fancy index
Apr 17 20:01:39 <grym>	thecal code's the worst :( 
Apr 17 20:01:47 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: oh i found a setup.py that calls cmake once 
Apr 17 20:01:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Huh
Apr 17 20:02:06 <grym>	and then reads cmakecache.txt 
Apr 17 20:02:09 <grym>	and calls cmake again if it has to 
Apr 17 20:02:15 <grym>	facebook is great 
Apr 17 20:02:16 <refusenick>	I wish there was a Python formatter for this style: https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html
Apr 17 20:02:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: reeee
Apr 17 20:03:18 <grym>	refusenick: i disagree pretty strongly with most of that document, so let's talk about a bikeshed of a better color please
Apr 17 20:03:19 <bremner>	didi: my initial response to the discourse experiment is that it will probably mean I participate in less discussions. We'll see. It's not like I can function without a giant ball of JS-browser these days anyway
Apr 17 20:03:58 <bremner>	didi: I unsubscribed from debian-devel@lists.debian.org for 5 years or so, so I expect I can manage.
Apr 17 20:04:01 <didi>	bremner: That's my prediction of all these kinds of effort.
Apr 17 20:04:39 <refusenick>	I can see even more ways to abuse it and feel at home if I get fancy with decorators and do the APL thing of aliasing common math functions (plus tensorial generalizations in numpy/tensorflow/{whatever you're using} ) to the corresponding unicode math character, but a formatter which followed that guide would be a start for me.
Apr 17 20:04:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	One thing browsers should integrate in their core is uMatrix-like functionality.
Apr 17 20:05:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	One shouldn't have to load unrelated crap.
Apr 17 20:05:01 <grym>	refusenick: it actively advocates for `import * ` and can thus be purged with fire
Apr 17 20:05:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: That's an anti-pattern, yes.
Apr 17 20:05:22 <grym>	last week i removed matplotlib as a dependency from a coworkers project
Apr 17 20:05:42 <grym>	because they had `from pylab import *` to use stdlib  `time.time`
Apr 17 20:05:44 <grym>	and _nothing else_
Apr 17 20:05:54 <didi>	grym: Unpossible. Once inside, dependencies never leave.
Apr 17 20:05:56 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: Have you made an issue upstream?
Apr 17 20:06:05 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: i force-pushed to their master
Apr 17 20:06:08 <refusenick>	behold, perfection itself: https://www.jsoftware.com/papers/AIOJ/onepage.htm
Apr 17 20:06:09 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: so no
Apr 17 20:06:11 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: not as such 
Apr 17 20:06:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: It'd be a good thing to fix the problem.
Apr 17 20:06:21 <grym>	but there's no more problem now 
Apr 17 20:06:36 <bpalmer>	git rm *; git push --force  ? 
Apr 17 20:06:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Also, what do you suggest instead of matplotlib?
Apr 17 20:06:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Seaman?
Apr 17 20:06:49 <grym>	i think you mean seaborn 
Apr 17 20:06:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	*seaborn\
Apr 17 20:06:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Da
Apr 17 20:06:58 <grym>	there's no getting around matplotlib as a fundamental thing. 
Apr 17 20:07:09 <grym>	spackle on top of it? seaborn, bokeh, plotnine, there are a few other nice-ish ones
Apr 17 20:07:25 <refusenick>	Stick to one everything-and-the-kitchen-sink math library, "import *" from it and alias what you need as tersely as you can, write what you want as compositions thereof.
Apr 17 20:07:37 <grym>	no 
Apr 17 20:07:41 <didi>	Let's hoard dependencies.
Apr 17 20:07:59 <grym>	brian2 `from numpy import *` and i cannot reason about their code
Apr 17 20:08:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: oh, that's what they're doing.
Apr 17 20:08:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I see.
Apr 17 20:08:15 <wgreenhouse>	didi: are we dragons?
Apr 17 20:08:16 <grym>	which is too bad because their spike algo's are slightly wrong 
Apr 17 20:08:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I much prefer keeping prefixes for namespaces...
Apr 17 20:08:27 <didi>	wgreenhouse: No, web developers, mostly.
Apr 17 20:08:35 <bpalmer>	if you shoot at our weak scales, do we not bleed fire?
Apr 17 20:08:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	import requests as r -> r.get("whatever.org")
Apr 17 20:08:44 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: numpy as np is totally kosher 
Apr 17 20:08:50 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: Yup.
Apr 17 20:08:53 <grym>	there are some de facto standards 
Apr 17 20:08:57 <grym>	i like typing as t 
Apr 17 20:09:48 <didi>	Maybe late stage capitalists.
Apr 17 20:09:50 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	>  if you shoot at our weak scales, do we not bleed fire? | lol
Apr 17 20:10:14 <refusenick>	Ideally, we'd have hardware which directly exposed its parallelism in a principled way (APL-like GPU opcodes in a Forth-like assembly with implicit loops and no ifs?), and we wouldn't even need to import a do-everything library which itself wraps OpenCL or something.
Apr 17 20:11:07 <didi>	rudybot: What do you think about bailing out rich dragons?
Apr 17 20:11:11 <rudybot>	didi: instead, we've chosen to punish "strategic defaulters" for bailing when they're underwater
Apr 17 20:13:34 <refusenick>	I just want my linear algebra to run fast and fit in one file so I don't have to mess around with project tooling and all that jazz.
Apr 17 20:14:16 <refusenick>	Oh, and be directly transcribed from what I have on paper to a program. I'm lazy.
Apr 17 20:14:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm. I'm imagining a #apl reader macro.
Apr 17 20:14:56 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: #apl reader macro?
Apr 17 20:15:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: It'd be a "best of both worlds" option to have folks able to write their APL in a manner which makes it accessible to less skilled Lispers. 
Apr 17 20:17:01 <refusenick>	https://github.com/phantomics/april
Apr 17 20:19:10 <refusenick>	I once saw someone say that what they wanted was an APL syntax to TensorFlow which could written with a pen on a tablet. That's what I want.
Apr 17 20:20:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yeah... OCR isn't great yet. I wouldn't count on that working too well.
Apr 17 20:20:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: I like that repo you just linked. Thanks.
Apr 17 20:21:28 <pta2002>	Anyone know how to format this sort of thing properly in org-mode? https://imgur.com/a/rQOf7t5
Apr 17 20:21:44 <pta2002>	I just have $p1 = 5*3$ and then an empty line and then $p2 = 5*1$ etc
Apr 17 20:21:58 <pta2002>	but that sounds like there's definitely a better way to do it right?
Apr 17 20:25:22 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: This is hubristic because I'm sure someone has thought of it, but why not autoselect the first guess for the drawn character and display the other possibilities in a row of boxes above the character?
Apr 17 20:25:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: That's called an input method and that's a valid solution to that problem, yes.
Apr 17 20:27:15 <refusenick>	Given how slowly you write any kind of math (write down a few statements, erase and rewrite it in a cleaner way, maybe proceed further or revise what came before, etc), I don't think it'd face the same problems as general OCR like the Apple Newton.
Apr 17 20:28:21 <grym>	there is a DNN-based "take a picture of this equation and get a LaTeX string back" thing which i think is pretty clever
Apr 17 20:28:33 *	refusenick barfs
Apr 17 20:28:39 <grym>	it helps that you can more or less guarantee that you're looking at computer modern 
Apr 17 20:28:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: I'd probably see if there's already any such program for kanji or hanfu, then simply adapt the symbol library.
Apr 17 20:29:01 <grym>	https://mathpix.com/ 
Apr 17 20:29:03 <grym>	OCR sucks though 
Apr 17 20:29:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	...messed up the last word
Apr 17 20:29:07 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: That's a good idea
Apr 17 20:29:08 <grym>	there's no getting around that one :( 
Apr 17 20:29:12 <refusenick>	hanzi?
Apr 17 20:29:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	^ thank you
Apr 17 20:29:49 <refusenick>	grym: Oh, I've seen that one before! It's more for scanning notes when you're done.
Apr 17 20:31:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: A labor-intensive option would be collecting caligraphy training data for those specific symbol sets, in context and on their onw.
Apr 17 20:31:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	*own
Apr 17 20:32:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Do they teach APL notation in maths?
Apr 17 20:32:59 <refusenick>	No, I taught myself.
Apr 17 20:33:40 <refusenick>	They do have something similar in physics, though. APL is Einstein notation without indices. (which rightly sounds weird if you've ever used Einstein notation)
Apr 17 20:34:20 <refusenick>	There is a Russian book on tensor calculus (Golberg and Akivis) which uses Einstein notation.
Apr 17 20:34:31 <refusenick>	Goldberg and Akivis*
Apr 17 20:37:42 <grym>	refusenick: well at least you have np.einsum 
Apr 17 20:37:55 <grym>	and can disregard the rest of the API entirely except for like, loadtxt
Apr 17 20:39:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	hmm...
Apr 17 20:43:38 <krz>	hi
Apr 17 20:43:51 <krz>	Is it recommended to use GUI or terminal version of Emacs?
Apr 17 20:43:58 <bpalmer>	sure.
Apr 17 20:44:12 <krz>	Ive been a Vim user for several years. And used to Vim + tmux
Apr 17 20:44:22 <refusenick>	krz: GUI
Apr 17 20:44:34 <grym>	krz: whatever gets the job done 
Apr 17 20:44:41 <refusenick>	https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/12/29/don-t-use-terminal-emacs.html
Apr 17 20:44:41 <grym>	i use both, but most often the gui 
Apr 17 20:44:48 <bpalmer>	there are various things that are easier in a graphical view, including more support for some key sequences.
Apr 17 20:45:06 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	krz: GUI has more working features.
Apr 17 20:45:15 <refusenick>	grym: When do you not use the GUI? Remote dev where TRAMP doesn't run fast enough?
Apr 17 20:45:32 <technomancy>	terminal emacs is awesome for sharing w/ tmate.io
Apr 17 20:45:33 <grym>	refusenick: yeah, that's about it 
Apr 17 20:46:43 <dale>	technomancy: Hey, that's cooler than I was expecting.  I was expecting it to tell you that you have to expose your own SSH server, but it looks like that handles it for you.
Apr 17 20:46:49 <krz>	I typically "live" in the terminal. Do a lot of curls, mutt, weechat (irc), code, etc
Apr 17 20:47:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	krz: You can keep doing that. Some stuff just won't work quite as nicely.
Apr 17 20:47:22 <dale>	In theory I wonder if you could use tmate.io and just start "emacsclient -nw -c" against your already-running GUI client to share with someone else while you still use the GUI?  Probably.
Apr 17 20:47:38 <technomancy>	dale: you have to trust the intermediary or set up your own publically-accessible one unfortunately but hey
Apr 17 20:47:48 <dale>	technomancy: I've trusted worse.
Apr 17 20:48:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	krz: For example, no image display nor thumbnails in dired.
Apr 17 20:48:26 <dale>	technomancy: ...says the guy who just installed (and then promptly uninstalled) WebEx.
Apr 17 20:48:43 <dale>	(says the guy who *hopes* he just uninstalled WebEx)
Apr 17 20:48:46 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket
Apr 17 20:48:52 <dale>	(oh god I have to get a new laptop now, don't I)
Apr 17 20:49:26 <krz>	I have no use of viewing images on Emacs, will mainly use it to code on. But I feel a bit turned-off knowing that I have to rely on GUI
Apr 17 20:49:36 <krz>	Maybe Im just new, and not seeing the bigger picture yet
Apr 17 20:49:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	You don't have to.
Apr 17 20:49:51 <technomancy>	dale: firejail that shit, yo
Apr 17 20:50:06 <wgreenhouse>	you can also have emacs --daemon and have emacsclients on both gui and terminal, as desired
Apr 17 20:50:07 <wgreenhouse>	,salespitch
Apr 17 20:50:11 <fsbot>	We aren't gonna lie. Emacs sucks. Some of us tolerate it, but we can't tell you if YOU'LL be able to. Try it and make up your own mind.
Apr 17 20:50:24 <technomancy>	krz: it doesn't matter; nothing's wrong with terminal emacs
Apr 17 20:51:17 <dale>	technomancy: It's kind of you to forget that I run macOS.
Apr 17 20:51:17 <grym>	now that's a salespitch i can get behind 
Apr 17 20:51:17 <technomancy>	dale: oh, my condo lances 
Apr 17 20:51:20 <grym>	technomancy: apartmentspears!
Apr 17 20:51:20 <technomancy>	krz: the biggest downside of terminal emacs is that you can't use exwm TBH
Apr 17 20:51:20 <wgreenhouse>	terminal emacs is still pretty great. I live in it a lot lately thanks to constrained environments like ,,termux
Apr 17 20:51:20 <fsbot>	termux is an apt/dpkg-based distribution of CLI tools on the Android platform
Apr 17 20:51:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	krz: I use such features because I use Emacs for almost everything, including managing photo collections.
Apr 17 20:51:20 <technomancy>	grym: ...?
Apr 17 20:51:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	krz: If you have no such use-case, you're missing very little.
Apr 17 20:51:45 <dale>	technomancy: My Touch Bar™ mute button works nearly 25% of the time when I press it!
Apr 17 20:51:56 <wgreenhouse>	gui emacs is also a small advantage in terms of keybindings
Apr 17 20:52:07 <wgreenhouse>	specifically, the super and hyper keys
Apr 17 20:52:19 <grym>	technomancy: "condo lances"
Apr 17 20:52:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: hyper?
Apr 17 20:52:38 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: yes, H-
Apr 17 20:52:42 <grym>	dale: i was pretty amused to learn that the touchbar runs watchOS 
Apr 17 20:52:47 <technomancy>	grym: lol
Apr 17 20:52:49 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: the spacecadet keyboard had it, so we must as well
Apr 17 20:52:56 <wgreenhouse>	,dv x-hyper-keysym
Apr 17 20:52:56 <fsbot>	Which keys Emacs uses for the hyper modifier.
Apr 17 20:52:56 <fsbot>	This should be one of the symbols ‘ctrl’, ‘alt’, ‘hyper’, ‘meta’,
Apr 17 20:52:56 <fsbot>	‘super’.  For example, ‘hyper’ means use the Hyper_L and Hyper_R
Apr 17 20:52:56 <fsbot>	keysyms.  The default is nil, which is the same as ‘hyper’.
Apr 17 20:52:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Ah. I don't have it.
Apr 17 20:53:06 <refusenick>	dale: I installed Zoom (in a flatpak) on my Librebooted Thinkpad. Now that I have an extra laptop  for proprietary stuff (whose newer audio hardware hopefully works with the desktop client so I'm not stuck using it in Chromium), I'm thinking of wiping the Thinkpad and Librebooting it again.
Apr 17 20:53:35 <grym>	refusenick: we have chinaboxes that go into faraday cages when they come stateside
Apr 17 20:53:39 <refusenick>	How can I upload plaintext files in ~ and only the plain text?
Apr 17 20:53:42 <technomancy>	refusenick: I've been able to keep zoom quarantined to my mobile (which is already a lost cause as far as security goes)
Apr 17 20:53:58 <refusenick>	Are all the files verboten now? I'm not a security person.
Apr 17 20:53:58 <krz>	Hmm, brb
Apr 17 20:54:09 <technomancy>	bonus: mobile zoom lets you zoom in, and regular zoom ... doesn't, somehow?
Apr 17 20:54:28 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: upload them to where?
Apr 17 20:55:20 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: I have a Beaglebone Black lying around. I guess I'll make it into a server temporarily and transport the files onto an external harddrive over SFTP?
Apr 17 20:56:11 <wgreenhouse>	sure. or make a git repo on the beaglebone--might be a nice gift to your future self if life involves frequently wiping your laptop
Apr 17 20:56:16 <refusenick>	ghetto solution: upload it all to a pastebin service, leave it unlisted and hope no one stumbles on the URLs
Apr 17 20:56:27 <grym>	technomancy: speaking of space cadets, one day someone will make ergodox keycaps... 
Apr 17 20:56:56 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: Good idea. I remember reading about "gitolite". Sounds like this is what it's for.
Apr 17 20:56:56 <grym>	technomancy: https://drop.com/?origin=%2Fbuy%2Fmassdrop-x-oblotzky-gmk-space-cadet-keycap-set#imagecarousel look adorable but alas
Apr 17 20:56:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Slightly less ghetoo: encrypt it before
Apr 17 20:57:30 <technomancy>	grym: yeah... that's like ... the only non-blank set that actually appeals to me =)
Apr 17 20:57:36 <refusenick>	Better hurry before EARN IT goes through, then.
Apr 17 20:58:25 <grym>	technomancy: same 
Apr 17 20:58:37 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: probably overkill--gitolite is for managing fairly large multi-user git sites. you don't need it to have just one git repo for your dotfiles
Apr 17 20:58:41 <wgreenhouse>	but sure, have fun :)
Apr 17 20:58:44 <refusenick>	grym: What command did you use to install pyls via pipx?
Apr 17 20:59:01 <grym>	refusenick: pipx install 'python-language-server[all]'
Apr 17 20:59:05 <grym>	quotes non-optional 
Apr 17 20:59:27 <grym>	this is one of those "the package name and the tool name are not the same name" things 
Apr 17 20:59:40 <refusenick>	I didn't want to install black with it. Can you list the options as a comma-separated list?
Apr 17 20:59:58 <refusenick>	(actually, not just black - most of addons)
Apr 17 21:00:16 <krz>	I kinda like using hjkl from Vim for navigation. Is it possible to set this up without installing Evil?
Apr 17 21:00:35 <grym>	just omit the [all]
Apr 17 21:00:46 <refusenick>	I tried that command with a comma-separated list, and it threw nasty compile errors at me
Apr 17 21:01:05 <refusenick>	(it recognized and downloaded and tried building, but failed)
Apr 17 21:04:21 <refusenick>	grym: I will agree with you that ML Python code can be atrocious. I had a friend (Econ with minor in Data Science) ask me for help with a machine learning project, building off another team's model (just the model, no data). That was some of the worst Python I've seen. Pickles and objects everywhere instead of just chaining the tools like you're supposed to.
Apr 17 21:06:05 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: Is there a smaller alternative for Git with encrypted stuff?
Apr 17 21:06:08 <wgreenhouse>	krz: yes, there is also ,,viper,, which comes with emacs without installing an external package
Apr 17 21:06:09 <fsbot>	ViPer is [0] Viper is a vi-emulation in Emacs
Apr 17 21:06:10 <fsbot>	[1] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Viper
Apr 17 21:06:10 <fsbot>	[2] Viper Manual has a good intro to emacs from a vi standpoint
Apr 17 21:06:10 <fsbot>	[3] see http://paste.lisp.org/display/20528 for a vimmish viper
Apr 17 21:06:27 <grym>	refusenick: its because noone teaches them how to code
Apr 17 21:06:35 <refusenick>	I made a GPG key, but am going to delete it. It's far more trouble than it's worth, universal software compability be damned.
Apr 17 21:06:38 <grym>	refusenick: real science python is much the same 
Apr 17 21:07:21 <refusenick>	It's probably good that I spent a year as a CS major before switching, then.
Apr 17 21:07:39 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: sure. see e.g. git-crypt and git-remote-gcrypt
Apr 17 21:07:44 <refusenick>	Or maybe not. I'll be keenly aware of how broken everything is and how powerless I am to change it.
Apr 17 21:07:46 <krz>	I installed GUI emacs. How do I type this command to make it full screen: toggle-frame-maximized
Apr 17 21:08:07 <grym>	i'm so far not of the opinion that proper CS teaches anything close to good dev practices
Apr 17 21:08:48 <refusenick>	grym: Sure, but no one tells you to stop wasting time if you read blogs and contribute to open source projects.
Apr 17 21:08:53 <grym>	much the same way that a degree in particle physics is unlikely to encourage you to keep a clean machine shop 
Apr 17 21:09:05 <grym>	or teach you how to use a mill press
Apr 17 21:09:07 <holomorph>	krz: you should probably do the tutorial: C-h t
Apr 17 21:11:07 <refusenick>	krz: Have you considered an Emacs distribution which comes with Vim emulation? Check out Doom Emacs.
Apr 17 21:11:53 <krz>	I used similar distributions in Vim. But found them too bloated. Over configured etc. In the end stuck with "vanilla" vim and modified it to my liking
Apr 17 21:11:58 <catacombs>	refusenick: Seconding Doom Emacs
Apr 17 21:12:03 <catacombs>	It's my current distribution, and I love it
Apr 17 21:12:45 <krz>	I see there is also https://github.com/freetonik/castlemacs. It looks good. In the end, with vanilla Emacs, am I allowed to (eventually) configure Emacs, so it looks like Castlemacs?
Apr 17 21:13:03 <refusenick>	krz: Emacs is entirely about extensibility. If you use it, it's not bloat. You're allowed to do whatever you want.
Apr 17 21:13:04 <krz>	Basically, first thing I would like to do, is remove the menu bars
Apr 17 21:13:47 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: Do you read SMBC? https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/a-change
Apr 17 21:13:51 <technomancy>	bloat is a fake idea made up my minimalists in order to sell more minimalism
Apr 17 21:14:41 <lampilelo>	try having an old computer
Apr 17 21:14:53 <krz>	Cool, looking at the tutorial now
Apr 17 21:14:56 <refusenick>	technomancy: The people who go "bloat bloat bloat", that holds for. We now have actual bloat in the form of the web, though, because Unix didn't cut it and all the alternative paradigms were dead.
Apr 17 21:15:13 <catacombs>	technomancy: then you'll hate suckless software
Apr 17 21:15:37 <technomancy>	lampilelo: literally typing this on a core2duo =P
Apr 17 21:15:38 <krz>	Im curious. And possibly stupid question. Any ex-vim (couple of years) users here? Wondering if you see Emacs as being more productive 
Apr 17 21:15:40 <wgreenhouse>	aidalgol: :D
Apr 17 21:16:03 <refusenick>	krz: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs
Apr 17 21:16:05 <catacombs>	krz: are you talking about people who switched from vim to emacs?
Apr 17 21:16:06 <lampilelo>	technomancy: try older!
Apr 17 21:16:33 <technomancy>	lampilelo: I tried, but then you get into the zone where laptops have non-LED backlit screens and they're just too dim
Apr 17 21:17:10 <technomancy>	lampilelo: go newer and everything gets glossy; older and everything's dim. I found the local maximum and I'm sticking with it.
Apr 17 21:17:15 <tromey>	there's different kinds of bloat and some are bad and some are not
Apr 17 21:17:33 <aidalgol>	technomancy: You must not have to compile software, much.
Apr 17 21:17:34 <refusenick>	Emacs isn't bloated, it's curvy.
Apr 17 21:17:37 <tromey>	for instance sometimes people complain about the # of packages in emacs.  but this IMNSHO is actually irrelevant
Apr 17 21:17:45 <aidalgol>	tromey: Like bloat after a good, large meal.  That's good.
Apr 17 21:17:52 <technomancy>	aidalgol: I compile fennel all the time!
Apr 17 21:17:54 <tromey>	yes or a dead fish
Apr 17 21:18:07 <krz>	catacombs: Yea
Apr 17 21:18:33 <refusenick>	... a dead fish bloated because it's stuffed with delicious herbs?
Apr 17 21:18:55 <aidalgol>	technomancy: I was thinking more like fucking massive web junk, or even chains of Elixir dependencies, or C.
Apr 17 21:18:58 <aidalgol>	tromey: ?
Apr 17 21:19:06 <tromey>	just screwing around
Apr 17 21:19:07 <tromey>	I dunno
Apr 17 21:19:11 <aidalgol>	,slap tromey 
Apr 17 21:19:12 *	fsbot slaps tromey with a large halibut
Apr 17 21:19:18 <technomancy>	aidalgol: ah yeah, pleroma dev was nearly unusable until I found out how to just recompile one module at a time
Apr 17 21:19:20 <tromey>	pescadazo
Apr 17 21:19:22 <catacombs>	krz: check out this guy's blog: https://protesilaos.com/. He wrote about transitioning from vim to emacs
Apr 17 21:19:35 <technomancy>	but a single module recompiles in well under a second so M-x shrug
Apr 17 21:19:44 <aidalgol>	Yeah, that's fine, then.
Apr 17 21:20:07 <aidalgol>	I am genuinely surprised that you are not more into retrocomputing.
Apr 17 21:20:09 <refusenick>	My only criticism of Doom is that the community is centered on Discord, of all places.
Apr 17 21:20:12 <technomancy>	aidalgol: very rarely I'll compile a C program like Emacs or love2d
Apr 17 21:20:17 <technomancy>	refusenick: wow wtf
Apr 17 21:20:26 <refusenick>	technomancy: Right?
Apr 17 21:20:27 <krz>	Cool, will check
Apr 17 21:20:29 *	aidalgol whispers (love2d is C++)
Apr 17 21:20:41 <technomancy>	aidalgol: haha, shows you how rarely I do that =P
Apr 17 21:20:43 <refusenick>	krz: THAT is why you'll check it out? 
Apr 17 21:20:46 <aidalgol>	refusenick: Wait, what??
Apr 17 21:20:46 <fsbot>	Cannot predict now
Apr 17 21:20:48 <aidalgol>	Not quakenet??!
Apr 17 21:20:50 <lampilelo>	technomancy: i actually switched to linux full-time when i was using my old laptop from 2007 with 2 gb of ram and it felt slower and slower, especially because of web pages taking increasingly more memory
Apr 17 21:20:53 <aidalgol>	What the actual fuck?!
Apr 17 21:21:37 <technomancy>	lampilelo: back in the dark ages before ublock origin saved our souls =)
Apr 17 21:22:19 <tromey>	occasionally I use a browser without ublock origin and zomg
Apr 17 21:22:22 <lampilelo>	ublock origin wasn't enough
Apr 17 21:22:22 <refusenick>	Not only will the Web not die, but it looks like they're gunning to spread the cancer everywhere else with Wasm.
Apr 17 21:22:35 <tromey>	but wasm is good
Apr 17 21:22:41 <lampilelo>	tromey: why would you do that?
Apr 17 21:22:48 <tromey>	it has better performance, which is anti- the bad kind of bloat
Apr 17 21:22:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: You code Clojure on a core-duo?
Apr 17 21:23:25 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: most of the Clojure code I write is running on a newer thinkpad, but I connect to that one over SSH from my old one, yeah
Apr 17 21:23:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Ah I see.
Apr 17 21:23:51 <refusenick>	tromey: It's worse than the JVM. If Graal + Truffle wasn't Oracle's (use at own risk of litigation), it'd be clearly superior.
Apr 17 21:23:53 <technomancy>	I did all the development of Leiningen on a core2duo tho
Apr 17 21:23:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	tromey: It also makes obfuscation even easier for nonfree JS though
Apr 17 21:24:16 <tromey>	remember when web browsers didn't want to ship the jvm since it was 2 megabytes?
Apr 17 21:24:17 <tromey>	lol
Apr 17 21:24:22 <refusenick>	(also if JVM tooling weren't insufferably overcomplicated garbage tied to Java, but it's not like webdev is better)
Apr 17 21:24:32 <lampilelo>	lol
Apr 17 21:24:37 <aidalgol>	tromey: nono, you see, it will allow them to cram *more* bloat in, and and and, obfuscate code more betterer, and hide cryptominers!!!1
Apr 17 21:24:52 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Um, yeah, have you actually looked at obfuscated JS?
Apr 17 21:25:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: Yes. It's already absurdly annoying. It doesn't have to get worse.
Apr 17 21:25:28 <aidalgol>	refusenick: I find web dev *much* more pleasant than Java dev.
Apr 17 21:25:33 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Right...
Apr 17 21:25:42 <lampilelo>	what are the chances of vms running on top of javascript in the future? people seem to love new layers of abstraction
Apr 17 21:26:05 <aidalgol>	Because obfuscated JS is soooo much more readable than wasm.
Apr 17 21:26:15 <bandali>	https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript
Apr 17 21:26:17 <technomancy>	lampilelo: we already got that https://fengari.io/
Apr 17 21:26:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It irritates me how many sites try to run opaque arbitrary code on my computer.
Apr 17 21:26:17 <aidalgol>	lampilelo: Does anyone still use VMS?
Apr 17 21:26:23 <technomancy>	also bandali's link =)
Apr 17 21:26:28 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: Not really, it just isn't actually assembly.
Apr 17 21:26:47 <refusenick>	aidalgol: I initially had "but it's not like webdev is much better", but I dropped the "much" to insult it anyways. I couldn't even figure out how to install Clojure because I had never used the JVM. (only read about its structure)
Apr 17 21:26:47 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Nor is wasm.
Apr 17 21:26:54 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: fair
Apr 17 21:27:23 <aidalgol>	tromey: Remember when Flash was seen as A Good Thing, Actually™?
Apr 17 21:27:28 *	aidalgol shudders
Apr 17 21:27:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ew
Apr 17 21:27:37 <tromey>	I still trip over flash sites sometimes
Apr 17 21:27:39 <aidalgol>	"Dude, just install Flash."  "NO!"
Apr 17 21:27:47 <tromey>	my kids school sent them to one
Apr 17 21:28:51 <aidalgol>	Now I'm going to go play proprietary videogames, like the fun-loving heathen I am.
Apr 17 21:29:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: So long as you do it on a machine you take into account is compromised~
Apr 17 21:29:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	:p
Apr 17 21:29:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(That's what I do after all)
Apr 17 21:31:13 <refusenick>	Anyone else here built gccemacs? (feature/nativecomp branch)
Apr 17 21:32:07 <tromey>	does it really take 7 hours
Apr 17 21:32:52 <refusenick>	 tromey: Make that 12 or so. It just finished this morning.
Apr 17 21:33:04 <tromey>	that seems bad
Apr 17 21:33:38 <grym>	aidalgol: well, candyland was great in highschool 
Apr 17 21:33:46 <refusenick>	Yeah, but I've seen videos where it whizzes along with tons of LSP alerts and completions in posframes as the user types at 100 WPM.
Apr 17 21:33:56 <refusenick>	a video*
Apr 17 21:34:06 <refusenick>	I can't find it anymore.
Apr 17 21:35:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	For an easy example of the kinds of shenanigans necessary to do stuff with obfuscated JS, take a look at some of the more complicated extractors in youtube-dl
Apr 17 21:35:06 <refusenick>	Anyways, most time is spent building stuff left unused (foreign charset support, games, etc). I read that it now has an on-demand compile option, which is nice.
Apr 17 21:36:09 <tromey>	I feel that a real jit would be preferable.  I've been meaning to rewrite my jit in terms of MIR instead of libjit... one of these days
Apr 17 21:36:21 <refusenick>	Aurora_v_kosmose: It's amazing that JS can be complicated to parse. Usually, prototypical OO languages are extremely simple, the more prototypical the more so. (ending with Io & co)
Apr 17 21:36:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: Until you start implementing partly-encrypted bytecode VMs inside it to hide what you're doing.
Apr 17 21:37:07 <tromey>	js made a lot of absurd parsing choices
Apr 17 21:37:58 <refusenick>	tromey: How much of the original 5-day language is left? Is it still as weakly typed as in the "Wat" talk?
Apr 17 21:38:30 <tromey>	I would guess all of it, but I don't really know
Apr 17 21:38:30 <wasamasa>	it's all opt-in improvements
Apr 17 21:38:42 <tromey>	web stuff generally tries to be backward compatible
Apr 17 21:39:13 <refusenick>	I'm actually curious because I want to write my website in a high-level language (compiled to Wasm) and not touch webdev directly, but I'll still have to use a virtual DOM API.
Apr 17 21:39:28 <wasamasa>	wouldn't want that ancient auth frontend assuming you might still use IE6 to break for the poor sobs at <fortune 500>
Apr 17 21:39:50 <wasamasa>	you still need to consult MDN
Apr 17 21:39:53 <wasamasa>	and MDN assumes you know JS
Apr 17 21:40:01 <wasamasa>	so now you have two problems
Apr 17 21:40:19 <wasamasa>	web people don't mind, they love JS and knowing all about it
Apr 17 21:40:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I miss the inexistant time when things weren't mostly proprietary.
Apr 17 21:41:37 <refusenick>	wasamasa: I'm thinking of doing it in Prolog. I'll be able to describe the structure in clauses and generate a Gopher page, perhaps. Basic JS is a bog-standard Algol clone at first glance. Knowing how weird it is, though, I do not want to maintain it directly in any capacity.
Apr 17 21:41:38 <technomancy>	you mean ... the 1970s?
Apr 17 21:41:54 <lampilelo>	i made one web application and i wrote it in c++
Apr 17 21:42:11 <lampilelo>	but it would be beneficial to know something about web dev
Apr 17 21:42:12 <refusenick>	A real programmer is among us.
Apr 17 21:42:13 <technomancy>	back before people realized that copyright could even be applied to software
Apr 17 21:42:26 <refusenick>	C++ is the modern Fortran, after all.
Apr 17 21:42:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Nah, there never was such a time as I'm describing.
Apr 17 21:42:47 <grym>	lo, fortran is the modern fortran 
Apr 17 21:43:20 <refusenick>	grym: Fortran now looks nothing like Fortran then.
Apr 17 21:43:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Indeed.
Apr 17 21:43:30 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I was thinking of when Bill Gates wrote his Open Letter and got mad about hackers thinking it was fine to copy any software they wanted
Apr 17 21:43:51 <ahungry>	not as a serious project, but for fun I wrote a restful web app in about 30 lines of bash - it includes user creation/getting list of users (jq for json, and sqlite3 for persistence)
Apr 17 21:44:02 <lampilelo>	refusenick: i don't know if i'd do it again
Apr 17 21:44:15 <ahungry>	https://github.com/ahungry/scratch/blob/master/langless-web/app/cgi-bin/index.sh
Apr 17 21:44:15 <tromey>	js has a bad rep but it's alright to work in
Apr 17 21:44:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: I don't remember. 
Apr 17 21:44:15 <lampilelo>	it was pretty painful
Apr 17 21:44:15 <tromey>	on FF devtools, IIRC, I got bit a couple of times by classic JS gotchas
Apr 17 21:44:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The JS dev environment is annoying to setup.
Apr 17 21:44:33 <tromey>	but that's not often for a large code base
Apr 17 21:44:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's easier to learn autotools.
Apr 17 21:44:36 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(Yes, it's that bad)
Apr 17 21:44:51 <tromey>	I resemble that remark
Apr 17 21:45:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Well, I'm comparing it to think like Python's. Which is probably unfair.
Apr 17 21:45:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	*things
Apr 17 21:45:35 <refusenick>	lampilelo: I'd like to build emscripten/emsdk from source (so I can stick it in an xbps-src template and let a build_style script do most of the work for me), but I can only find binaries in their Git repo(s) and no "build everything and bootstrap" makefile or Cmake_lists.txt
Apr 17 21:46:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	tromey: Mind, I said that autotools isn't easy to learn. Not that it doesn't work (obviously it does).
Apr 17 21:46:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Learning basic project of "do this incantation and it works", sure. Learning why? Not so simple.
Apr 17 21:46:45 <refusenick>	lampilelo: Do you still need to use npm (or whatever other bloated web tools are in vogue) to build a page with Wasm + a virtual DOM wrapper?
Apr 17 21:47:33 <tromey>	webpack makes npm look reasonable
Apr 17 21:47:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	heh
Apr 17 21:48:38 <ahungry>	I've tinkered with a lot of languages and build chains, and by far, the worst/most frustrating one was what I ran into yesterday - trying to statically link/build a gtk + curl app
Apr 17 21:48:38 <ahungry>	 
Apr 17 21:48:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ahungry: Oh?
Apr 17 21:48:41 <ahungry>	well, host OS probably plays a problem in that, as arch (and most others?) don't ship the archive files anymore, only shared objects
Apr 17 21:48:58 <ahungry>	and things like libcurl.a do not actually bundle up their deps like an ssl lib and libcares.a etc
Apr 17 21:49:17 <ahungry>	so, while node is not a great PL, something like npm at least handles dependency resolution cleanly
Apr 17 21:49:28 <ahungry>	for deps of deps
Apr 17 21:50:36 <lampilelo>	refusenick: idk, i was using wt (web toolkit) for c++, never even touched anything web-specific
Apr 17 21:50:37 <refusenick>	I am so confused when I hear about the "node" programming language. Isn't it just serverside JS? 
Apr 17 21:50:47 <refusenick>	lampilelo: perfecto
Apr 17 21:50:57 <refusenick>	(except for the C++ part)
Apr 17 21:51:31 <ahungry>	it has its own set of BIF/stdlib, as well as c++ interop possible with custom module system (gyp) - so it isn't quite the same as browser JS even if a lot of features are supported on both sides
Apr 17 21:52:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Browser-side JS & Node-side JS have different standard libraries, basically.
Apr 17 21:52:10 <aidalgol>	refusenick: wasm isn't for letting you write "a website" in any arbitrary language.  It's the formalisation of emscripten, which was created to do things like compile a Unity game to run in a browser.
Apr 17 21:52:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	:/
Apr 17 21:53:24 <aidalgol>	s/formalisation/standardisation/
Apr 17 21:54:12 <lampilelo>	afaik adobe lightroom was ported to web-assembly
Apr 17 21:54:36 <lampilelo>	which is impressive
Apr 17 21:58:07 <refusenick>	aidalgol: God fucking damn it. I just want to spew opinions on my own site without losing brain cells to maintaining bare JS/HTML/CSS. (or the worse-than-the-disease "cures")
Apr 17 21:58:44 <refusenick>	(and have a little more interactivity and control over how it looks than exporting a static blog from Org Mode, which'll probably be a big part anyways)
Apr 17 21:59:26 <ahungry>	org export has real nice styles I think - I used readtheorg for this: https://ahungry.com/projects/index.html , and I use a customized css for my blog https://ahungry.com/blog 
Apr 17 21:59:28 <grym>	refusenick: go full 1994 and just export bare HTML and leave it to your readers to theme things :) 
Apr 17 22:02:34 <refusenick>	I know nothing about webdev, but like having strong opinions after reading a hot take, so I'm now against blogs: https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/
Apr 17 22:03:08 <refusenick>	grym: I started composing what I just sent before you even said that. 
Apr 17 22:03:14 <refusenick>	Great minds think alike, and so do we.
Apr 17 22:04:29 <grym>	refusenick: haha 
Apr 17 22:04:50 <grym>	it's like playing the "how much do you trust this professor's website", the game
Apr 17 22:05:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Enough to run it in a VM.
Apr 17 22:06:14 <aidalgol>	refusenick: Use a really simple static-site generator.
Apr 17 22:08:03 <refusenick>	aidalgol: I'm thinking of using one in Prolog. I've heard good things about it as a web templating language on the server side. If could use it on the client side, that'd be even better.
Apr 17 22:08:12 <aidalgol>	refusenick: That "hot take" is pretty much just Old Lady Yells At Cloud.
Apr 17 22:08:32 <ahungry>	prolog web facilities aren't great, I mean, I guess it depends on what you're comparing it to
Apr 17 22:08:44 <aidalgol>	With no introduction, no premise, no argument, just one long screed about how the web used to be better back in the good old days.
Apr 17 22:08:46 <grym>	refusenick: the givewaway is "if the publications list is less than 5 years out of date, they're not working hard enough"
Apr 17 22:08:50 <ahungry>	with DCG you can make a toy DSL that is almost as good as a clojure hiccup DSL
Apr 17 22:09:27 <refusenick>	grym: I personally like those barebones text-based professor webpages.
Apr 17 22:09:34 <ahungry>	https://github.com/ahungry/semblance/blob/master/src/controllers/default.pro#L71
Apr 17 22:09:57 <grym>	refusenick: like https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html 
Apr 17 22:10:01 <grym>	infinte trust 
Apr 17 22:10:08 <grym>	i will do whatever you say, fullscreen <hr/> man 
Apr 17 22:10:13 <ahungry>	awhile back I (started to) make a prolog based "web-framework", including extendding the prolog html templater to handle python like django syntax
Apr 17 22:10:33 <ahungry>	I don't think any web alternatives will be better than cljs in this day and age
Apr 17 22:11:41 <refusenick>	ahungry: That's exactly what I was thinking. Use it to build DSLs to generate various parts of the DOM and embed partial evaluation rules to minimize it. Nice and simple, easy to reason about. Plus, you get a (dynamic fact) database for free!
Apr 17 22:12:13 <refusenick>	(what you said earlier about replicating Clojure's hiccup)
Apr 17 22:12:43 <refusenick>	(I don't know Clojure and have only heard hiccup mentioned as a way to represent web stuff with sexprs)
Apr 17 22:12:44 <ahungry>	prolog has a very sparse ecosystem- that project I did (semblance) was an attempt to pull in what was out there, but the most you'll tend to find for resources will be some of anniepoo (Annie Ogden) prolog tutorials and other thin resources spread out
Apr 17 22:13:07 <ahungry>	I mean it could be "fun" for the journey, but the destination isn't going to outdo whats present imho
Apr 17 22:13:14 <refusenick>	ahungry: How long ago was this?
Apr 17 22:13:36 <ahungry>	4 years ago (2015/2016) was the last time I spent on it
Apr 17 22:14:29 <refusenick>	.pro isn't SWI Prolog, right? I've only seen (and used) .pl extensions. Is this SICSTUS? YAP?
Apr 17 22:14:50 <ahungry>	.pro is an arbitrary extension choice because .pl conflicts with perl
Apr 17 22:14:59 <ahungry>	but the module loader in swipl cna work with both via a config setting
Apr 17 22:15:22 <ahungry>	re: hiccup, this was a "hiccup implementation" in a small lisp called Janet that I wrote about a month ago in a tiny amount of linles
Apr 17 22:15:24 <ahungry>	https://github.com/ahungry/janet-code/blob/master/hiccup.janet#L58 
Apr 17 22:15:28 <aidalgol>	refusenick: Racket already has tools for this.
Apr 17 22:16:09 <refusenick>	aidalgol: I'm sick of lambdas. I used to be into Scheme, then Kernel. Familiarity breeds contempt.
Apr 17 22:16:17 <ahungry>	if you wanted to ease into the web space via an unconvential path, and are a fan of prolog, you may want to peek at erlang
Apr 17 22:16:31 <ahungry>	if you get used to erlang, you can have a solid foundation for elixir and their popular Phoenix web framework
Apr 17 22:17:20 <refusenick>	ahungry: I was considering reusing Erlang libraries and wrapping a declarative templating interface around it in Mercury. (which can compile to the BEAM)
Apr 17 22:17:43 <refusenick>	It has the most stupid-smart smart-stupid FFI I've ever seen.
Apr 17 22:18:44 <ahungry>	nice, i played with mercury a bit, I have metal-mercury-mode out on github that a mercury fan recently did a huge revamp to 
Apr 17 22:18:55 <ahungry>	I dno't think I had it added to melpa yet, come to think of it
Apr 17 22:19:07 <ahungry>	https://github.com/ahungry/metal-mercury-mode
Apr 17 22:19:24 <ahungry>	the built in mercury mode was not very good when I tried before so I derived this from prolog mode or something, it was awhile ago
Apr 17 22:19:26 <refusenick>	I started writing a Mercury mode because the existing one is horribly broken, but I never get this kind of stuff done.
Apr 17 22:19:32 <refusenick>	This is great!
Apr 17 22:19:41 <ahungry>	that project is open source/gpl as all things should be
Apr 17 22:19:46 <ahungry>	so fork away/take from it what you will :) 
Apr 17 22:19:48 <refusenick>	:D
Apr 17 22:20:16 <refusenick>	I wonder if flycheck-mercury will work with it out of the box. I imagine it should.
Apr 17 22:20:47 <ahungry>	probably, I think the flycheck modes tend to be pretty indepentent of the host mode 
Apr 17 22:21:04 <ahungry>	the metal-mercury-mode doesn't do much beyond better indentation/highlighting and those 2 hot keys 
Apr 17 22:21:33 <refusenick>	Indentation is what's been bugging me, but highlighting is also appreciated.
Apr 17 22:22:26 <ahungry>	yea, I remember mercury having really poor indentation espepcially with cuts and arrows on the default mode
Apr 17 22:22:37 <ahungry>	probably tonight i'll tidy up that repo and see about adding to melpa
Apr 17 22:22:45 <refusenick>	Thanks for writing it!
Apr 17 22:22:45 <ahungry>	time too go for now, take it easy emacsen
Apr 17 23:44:59 <refusenick>	If you start Emacs as "emacs --daemon", does "emacs" still bring up a new instance? Do you have to call "emacsclient" to use the daemon?
Apr 17 23:46:28 <grym>	refusenick: you have to call emacsclient
Apr 17 23:46:44 <grym>	i have an `em` alias for this reason 
Apr 18 01:01:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	refusenick: I tend to instantiate my first frame with "emacsclient ~/"
Apr 18 01:01:54 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	erh, "emacsclient -c ~/"
Apr 18 01:58:47 <refusenick>	What variable says if Emacs was launched as a daemon or not?
Apr 18 01:59:19 <refusenick>	I'd like to load EXWM when it wasn't and split it into frames instead of windows when it is.
Apr 18 01:59:25 <refusenick>	when it was*
Apr 18 02:00:01 <ayuce>	,df daemonp
Apr 18 02:00:01 <fsbot>	daemonp is a built-in function in ‘src/emacs.c’.
Apr 18 02:00:01 <fsbot>	(daemonp)
Apr 18 02:00:01 <fsbot>	Return non-nil if the current emacs process is a daemon.
Apr 18 02:00:01 <fsbot>	If the daemon was given a name argument, return that name.
Apr 18 02:00:31 <refusenick>	ayuce: Ah, thanks. I was looking for variables.
Apr 18 02:01:08 <refusenick>	I forgot that info's sometimes accessed via unary predicates instead.
Apr 18 02:01:22 <ayuce>	M-x: apropos when you are confused.
Apr 18 02:01:46 <refusenick>	huh
Apr 18 02:02:03 <refusenick>	I've seen apropos be mentioned, but never actually used it.
Apr 18 02:02:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	c-h a
Apr 18 02:02:48 <ayuce>	no, that's different.
Apr 18 02:03:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So I just noticed. Well now. That's inconvenient.
Apr 18 02:04:10 <ayuce>	you can always rebind C-h a to apropos if that's what you prefer.
Apr 18 02:04:40 <refusenick>	"C-h a" is already bound to "counsel-apropos" for me. Much better than the default.
Apr 18 02:06:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah, matching all symbols? I should map that.
Apr 18 02:45:18 <parsnip>	let's execute arbitrary user code
Apr 18 02:46:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(eval args)
Apr 18 03:44:56 <zeta_0>	how do i exit eshell when it's running something? Ctrl-d and Ctrl-c do not work, eshell stuck
Apr 18 03:46:56 <spikemaster>	not sure if it works but try C-x k
Apr 18 03:47:22 <jamzattack>	zeta_0: you could just kill the buffer, but C-c C-k kills the process rather than C-c C-c which just sends interrupt
Apr 18 03:47:26 <zeta_0>	oh C-c C-c works: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32163645/how-to-terminate-process-inside-eshell-mode#32163850
Apr 18 03:47:48 <zeta_0>	thanks
Apr 18 03:48:33 <zeta_0>	when is emacs 27 going to be officially released?
Apr 18 04:41:44 <jlf>	,channel-wisdom
Apr 18 04:41:47 <fsbot>	my son mooned me by using eclipse. Disclaimer: I don't have a son. (any more)
Apr 18 04:47:13 <Moondhum>	Hello, I want  to make read-only-mode my default to avoid typing unintentionally while moving around. So I added (read-only-mode 1) to my init.el but whenever I do get "buffer is read only" but the file is blank. Guys, what am I missing here?
Apr 18 04:48:14 <jamzattack>	... You want every buffer to be read-only?
Apr 18 04:48:56 <Moondhum>	yes until I switch to edit mode, something like vim.
Apr 18 04:49:45 <Moondhum>	so far I use C-x C-q but it would be easier if it would be the default.
Apr 18 04:50:20 <jamzattack>	(read-only-mode 1) should only make init.el read only.  Maybe (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'read-only-mode) ?
Apr 18 04:52:17 <Moondhum>	jamzattack that worked, thank you :)
Apr 18 04:55:45 <ayuce>	he is out already but i wonder whether he discovers the view-mode for vim like experience instead of just read-only-mode.
Apr 18 04:56:46 <jamzattack>	Yeah view-mode is damn fine
Apr 18 04:57:19 <jamzattack>	read-only-mode without it is just pointless frankly
Apr 18 05:02:25 <ayuce>	%s/he/he\/she
Apr 18 05:03:05 <ayuce>	correct, actually it is my favorite mode by far.
Apr 18 05:03:36 <ayuce>	+20ish key bindings and free evil/god mode.
Apr 18 05:03:38 <jamzattack>	char 12: unterminated `s' command
Apr 18 05:08:22 <ayuce>	good old sed.
Apr 18 05:09:02 <shukryzablah>	what is botwanking
Apr 18 05:09:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	,botwanking
Apr 18 05:09:22 <fsbot>	I heard botwanking is spamming bots on channel. if you must, do so in PM.
Apr 18 05:09:45 <ArthurStrong>	Hi all. Weird question. I think I suffer from a constant rush and haste when working. Maybe is there a plugin that can warn me that I work too fast? Open/save files too fast, issue commands, etc?
Apr 18 05:09:58 <ArthurStrong>	same question about bash/zsh
Apr 18 05:11:22 <offby1>	oh probably :-)
Apr 18 05:16:46 <shukryzablah>	how do i put those pretty license notice headers that ppl put in their elisp files
Apr 18 05:19:59 <technomancy>	M-w, C-y
Apr 18 05:20:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Not really.
Apr 18 05:55:18 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Are you just trolling?
Apr 18 05:56:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: @ license headers? No. Those keybinds aren't a template generation command.
Apr 18 05:56:50 <Moondhum>	Hello, I am trying to substitute key definition, from C-x C-q to C-[. Its read-only-mode toggle key to a new one. Tried reading the manual, but I don't quite get it. Please provide some hints. :)
Apr 18 05:56:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Plus that's an awfully manual way to do it, if your project has dozens of files.
Apr 18 05:57:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Something like putting the header in a file, then find mydir -type f -exec cat my-file.txt {} > {}; would work better.
Apr 18 05:58:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Except that one specifically won't because you can't directly pipe into the same filename without causing problems.
Apr 18 05:58:36 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: No, when you said "not really".
Apr 18 05:59:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: That's literally what I was answering to.
Apr 18 06:01:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: I have no idea what offby1 was answering to.
Apr 18 06:26:10 <jamzattack>	shukryzablah: M-x auto-insert
Apr 18 06:27:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah that looks a lot more like it.
Apr 18 06:35:31 <refusenick>	Anyone use Emacs on Stumpwm with no windows, only frames? 
Apr 18 06:39:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm kind of curious about StumpWM, how is it generally?

Apr 18 09:02:53 <wasamasa>	no
Apr 18 09:03:00 <wasamasa>	bitmap fonts can be anything
Apr 18 09:03:29 <wasamasa>	crisp pixels with no scaling :P
Apr 18 09:08:46 <jusss>	wasamasa: my monitor is 1920x1080, 15 inch, but that fonts display not well
Apr 18 09:09:07 <wasamasa>	scaling bitmap fonts is a bad idea
Apr 18 09:09:22 <wasamasa>	use outline fonts for that
Apr 18 09:09:34 <jusss>	any suggestion?
Apr 18 09:09:37 <jusss>	which one?
Apr 18 09:10:16 <wasamasa>	there is no single font covering all scripts
Apr 18 09:10:36 <wasamasa>	well, asides from gnufont, but you don't really want that
Apr 18 09:10:37 <jamzattack>	jusss: https://idiocy.org/emacs-fonts-and-fontsets.html
Apr 18 09:11:30 <wasamasa>	what emacs does is asking font-config for fonts that support a specific script and use one of them
Apr 18 09:11:40 <wasamasa>	so normally you shouldn't need to mess around with fontsets
Apr 18 09:11:48 <wasamasa>	unless you want to force it to pick a specific font
Apr 18 09:14:03 <jusss>	ok
Apr 18 09:40:39 <jusss>	jamzattack: thanks
Apr 18 09:45:13 <krz>	Im following https://medium.com/@suvratapte/configuring-emacs-from-scratch-intro-3157bed9d040 and in the part where Im doing (line-number-mode t). But I dont see anything new
Apr 18 09:45:34 <krz>	Is the above command correct?
Apr 18 09:46:53 <jamzattack>	From docstring: "If called from Lisp, also enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil"
Apr 18 09:47:03 <jamzattack>	so it should just be (line-number-mode)
Apr 18 09:48:02 <krz>	Ok let me try that
Apr 18 09:49:59 <krz>	jamzattack:  What am I supposed to see?
Apr 18 09:50:06 <krz>	I dont see anythign new with that enabled
Apr 18 09:50:20 <jamzattack>	Line number in mode-line
Apr 18 09:50:43 <jamzattack>	If you want numbers on the side of the buffer, see `display-line-numbers-mode'
Apr 18 10:01:16 <krz>	Thanks
Apr 18 10:11:24 <krz>	On OSX, I installed va homebrew. ie. brew cask install emacs. Should I have been using the Cocoa version instead?

Apr 18 18:12:40 <contrapunctus[x]>	stepnem: I did that, obviously. 🙂
Apr 18 18:13:08 <stepnem>	WFM
Apr 18 18:14:34 <codingquark>	wasamasa: does nov.el need some sort of HTML library to be installed separately if installed via apt? The book looked different (headings were big fonts etc) before I moved.
Apr 18 18:14:51 <codingquark>	Or can it be because of my font settings?
Apr 18 18:15:39 <codingquark>	Hmm, if I increase/decrease font size, the markup goes away
Apr 18 18:17:13 <codingquark>	wasamasa: okay, it seems to be because of me choosing Iosevka in variable pitch. Sorry for the trouble. But interestingly, why does the markup go away _after_ the sizes change?
Apr 18 18:17:28 <krz>	Is Swiper good to use? Or is there a better alternative?
Apr 18 18:18:05 <codingquark>	It has been good so far
Apr 18 18:18:20 <codingquark>	I think you should try and see if it fits your needs, really
Apr 18 18:18:34 <bandali>	thblt, hey, do you still use the dark monochrome-ish theme from a while ago?
Apr 18 18:26:48 <thblt>	bandali: Eziam? No, I've replaced it with a custom variant of Solarized.
Apr 18 18:27:21 <bandali>	thblt, yeah probably that. ah, i see
Apr 18 18:29:59 <contrapunctus[x]>	Can anyone say why the second defvar returns an error? http://dpaste.com/0NGAK6H
Apr 18 18:30:55 <thblt>	bandali: it was a fork of Tao, another monochrome theme, which in turn borrowed its face definitions from bbatsov's version of Zenburn, which were the same as his Solarized.  Since bbatsov's solarized allows very extensive customization, I just created an Eziam-ish variant in my config.  
Apr 18 18:31:34 <thblt>	If I find the time I'll port Eziam as a Solarized variant, so the loop will be complete :)
Apr 18 18:31:36 <bandali>	thblt, gotcha, will check it out. is it free?
Apr 18 18:33:22 <thblt>	bandali: all themes I've mentioned are FLOSS. My monochrome variant of Solarized isn't released, it's in solaris*.el here https://github.com/thblt/.emacs.d/tree/master/lib
Apr 18 18:33:40 <bandali>	thblt, cool, thank you
Apr 18 18:43:13 <stepnem>	contrapunctus[x]: I think you mean (defmacro defalert (name time repeat alert-text &rest alert-args) `(apply #'defalert-internal ,time ,repeat ,alert-text ,alert-args))
Apr 18 18:45:50 <contrapunctus[x]>	stepnem: thanks. But after doing that, the second defvar says that 'goal' is not a variable.
Apr 18 18:48:50 <stepnem>	contrapunctus[x]: How is that surprising? I thought you were going to give goal some value somehow.
Apr 18 18:49:14 <stepnem>	Same for the other free identifiers in that form.
Apr 18 18:49:48 <krz>	Is there something similar to fuzzy search via FZF?
Apr 18 18:50:06 <krz>	In Vim, I use FZF to look for file names
Apr 18 18:50:19 <contrapunctus[x]>	stepnem: I'd like to do that in the code which calls funcall. The `defalert` is meant to be for user configuration, and the funcall is supposed to be in the package code (reading values from the user configuration).
Apr 18 18:51:13 <grym>	krz: helm-fzf 
Apr 18 18:51:21 <grym>	counsel has a variant too 
Apr 18 18:51:31 <grym>	and you can use grep/projectile/etc in tandem also 
Apr 18 18:54:18 <shukryzablah>	how does the macro system in elisp differ than common lisp? any good pointers to read on this? 
Apr 18 18:54:30 <krz>	grym: Well https://github.com/ibmandura/helm-fzf/blob/master/README.md doesnt say much 
Apr 18 18:55:47 <stepnem>	contrapunctus[x]: I think you'd better read up a bit on macros and backquote. E.g. (info "(elisp) Macros") (info "(elisp) Backquote")
Apr 18 18:57:45 <stepnem>	shukryzablah: It shouldn't really differ much if at all, save some details like lambda lists, which you can mostly emulate with cl-defmacro.
Apr 18 19:00:01 <stepnem>	Or *macroexpand-hook* or what not.
Apr 18 19:00:25 <stepnem>	(...is one of those missing things)
Apr 18 19:00:58 <grym>	krz: ok
Apr 18 19:01:01 <stepnem>	For most practical purposes it should be the same.
Apr 18 19:01:20 <shukryzablah>	stepnem: got it thx
Apr 18 19:06:41 <krz>	Is Helm or Ivy better for fuzzy search?
Apr 18 19:07:55 <krz>	Or Ido?
Apr 18 19:08:37 <contrapunctus[x]>	I like Ivy best, although I haven't gotten some features working yet. (like viewing documentation for a command when running M-x)
Apr 18 19:09:48 <grym>	i seem to use helm a lot 
Apr 18 19:10:52 <shukryzablah>	contrapunctus[x]: you mean ivy-rich? 
Apr 18 19:12:44 <contrapunctus[x]>	shukryzablah: thanks, that's pretty cool!
Apr 18 19:13:19 <contrapunctus[x]>	shukryzablah: I rather meant something like M-x <term> C-h -> open help buffer for selected command
Apr 18 19:24:00 <quiliro>	how can I browse on eww file://media/Wifi-Wimax/index.htm from dired?
Apr 18 19:24:17 <quiliro>	tryed & and M-&
Apr 18 19:30:33 <wgreenhouse>	quiliro: W
Apr 18 19:31:21 <bremner>	C-h m C-s browse
Apr 18 19:31:52 <bremner>	C-h m is worth becoming friends with
Apr 18 19:32:36 <krz>	Im trying to understand what I need for fuzzy searching a file name (can be in nested directories). What is needed for this?
Apr 18 19:34:00 <michaelrose>	contrapunctus[x]: I hadn't even thought of that sounds useful
Apr 18 19:35:12 <ayuce>	quiliro: you can also define a binding for it because W would probably open it with respect to your browser function, not with eww specifically.
Apr 18 19:35:56 <michaelrose>	contrapunctus[x]: you can use the alternate action key and hit h for the help for a function but it would be neat to show it inline
Apr 18 19:37:33 <michaelrose>	this doesn't keep the session like c-j in helm
Apr 18 19:38:50 <michaelrose>	default binding for optional choices is M-o
Apr 18 19:39:33 <contrapunctus[x]>	michaelrose: thanks a lot, TIL!
Apr 18 19:40:34 <stepnem>	C-M-o keeps the session
Apr 18 19:40:53 <michaelrose>	personally I like to bind that option to a key produced by tapping and releasing left shift 
Apr 18 19:49:52 <ayuce>	krz: maybe something like M-x: find-name-dired
Apr 18 19:54:12 <michaelrose>	does anyone know how to display help for a function inline with counsel-M-x?
Apr 18 19:54:52 <michaelrose>	same functionality is useful in theory in company but seems to suck in practice, ex company-quickhelp company-box
Apr 18 20:03:31 <stepnem>	michaelrose: By "inline" you mean next to the minibuffer completions? Isn't that what ivy-rich provides?
Apr 18 20:04:09 <michaelrose>	I'll check
Apr 18 20:05:04 <edgar-rft>	does ivy-rich make me rich?
Apr 18 20:05:44 <contrapunctus[x]>	edgar-rft: not merely rich, _ivy_ rich :>
Apr 18 20:06:25 <edgar-rft>	is that something for vegetarians?
Apr 18 20:06:55 <michaelrose>	yep thanks
Apr 18 20:08:09 <edgar-rft>	I once tried rich text but it didn't work either :(
Apr 18 20:08:28 <michaelrose>	works great here with all-the-icons too
Apr 18 20:09:03 <edgar-rft>	did it make you rich?
Apr 18 20:09:42 <Inline>	the foul rich ?
Apr 18 20:09:48 <Inline>	lol
Apr 18 20:11:01 <edgar-rft>	wow, Inline appeared, and I didn't even used ivy-rich!
Apr 18 20:11:14 <michaelrose>	regarding company- quickhelp/box the problem I have is that it seems to make it really slow to actually continue to type to narrow selection even with a 1 second delay set on it actually fetching docs
Apr 18 20:11:27 <Inline>	didn't used......
Apr 18 20:12:35 <Inline>	quantumleap to the pasts past
Apr 18 20:12:39 <Inline>	lol
Apr 18 20:16:11 <michaelrose>	its because the docs part isn't slow its actually slow at narrowing completions itself
Apr 18 20:22:46 <krz>	ayuce: Thats not fuzzy search
Apr 18 20:22:59 <krz>	I need would need to input the exact file name
Apr 18 20:24:12 <contrapunctus[x]>	krz: have you searched for 'fuzzy' on MELPA? I saw a ton of matching packages when you asked 🤔
Apr 18 20:24:34 <jayspeer>	I face a weird issue, when using some keys in magit I gen an error like this:
Apr 18 20:24:36 <jayspeer>	ad-handle-definition: ‘url-http-user-agent-string’ got redefined
Apr 18 20:24:38 <jayspeer>	ad-handle-definition: ‘url-http-handle-authentication’ got redefined
Apr 18 20:24:38 <jayspeer>	byte-code: Key sequence j p starts with non-prefix key j
Apr 18 20:24:38 <jayspeer>	 
Apr 18 20:24:58 <jayspeer>	sorry for spam - unintetional
Apr 18 20:25:47 <contrapunctus[x]>	"Key sequence j p" ...also the initials of your nick. Coincidence? 😏
Apr 18 20:26:13 <contrapunctus[x]>	jayspeer: is it reproducible?
Apr 18 20:26:39 <jayspeer>	contrapunctus[x]: hmm I hope so. and it's happening in magit only (so far). yeah, it's stays between emacs restarts
Apr 18 20:27:12 <contrapunctus[x]>	jayspeer: I meant, are there certain steps which can guarantee reproducing it?
Apr 18 20:28:21 <jayspeer>	contrapunctus[x]: hmm, I don't think so. Let me check step by step, so I can point you to something
Apr 18 20:28:56 <contrapunctus[x]>	jayspeer: and does it happen with -q?
Apr 18 20:29:45 <jayspeer>	contrapunctus[x]: I imaging you're no using guix... but I do. So on guix I installed emacs and emacs-magit packages, I imagine you know what they provide. When switching to project and running magit, I get the said error
Apr 18 20:29:50 <jayspeer>	let me try with -q
Apr 18 20:31:39 <jayspeer>	seems with -q it's ok -- I'll be investigating what breaks my config ;) 
Apr 18 20:31:40 <ayuce>	krz: you ask you want to understand what you need for fuzzy searching, you need something like i show you or any other regex type implementation of some sort. how fuzzy you want is just user interface. you can get tons of options with a simple web query.
Apr 18 20:38:13 <contrapunctus[x]>	,,next
Apr 18 20:38:13 <fsbot>	Another satisfied customer. NEXT!
Apr 18 20:42:08 <wasamasa>	codingquark: I have no idea what you're talking about
Apr 18 20:43:15 <krz>	ayuce: Ive tried a few including flx-ido. I still have to navigate to the directory to until a fuzzy search is executed
Apr 18 20:44:10 <krz>	Normally, i work in a project directory that has several other directories (nested) and files. From the project directory, Id like to get to a specific file regardless if its in some nested directory within the project directory
Apr 18 20:44:21 <krz>	In Vim, I can easily achieve this with FZF
Apr 18 20:45:01 <krz>	And its 2 lines of code:
Apr 18 20:45:03 <krz>	set rtp+=/usr/local/opt/fzf
Apr 18 20:45:05 <krz>	nnoremap <c-p> :FZF! --no-256 --no-bold --color=light,hl:214<cr>Y
Apr 18 20:45:24 <michaelrose>	you can do this with ivy/helm
Apr 18 20:46:15 <dale>	That sounds like Projectile.
Apr 18 20:46:34 <ayuce>	krz: you want something like helm-projectile-find-file
Apr 18 20:46:45 <ayuce>	it's fuzzy by defalt
Apr 18 20:47:22 <ayuce>	s/defalt/default
Apr 18 20:50:10 <krz>	ayuce So https://github.com/bbatsov/helm-projectile or am is there a standalone library just for the find file feature?
Apr 18 20:50:29 <YoungPotato>	Hi all. I have a lambda function to embed images into html as base64 upon org export to html. However, this function does not take into account settings like #+ATTR_HTML :width 300. The original org function does. These are the lambda and original function http://paste.debian.net/hidden/2e058990 My question is: how can I combine the two functions so that the lambda function also takes into account the information from the variable
Apr 18 20:50:29 <YoungPotato>	'attributes'?
Apr 18 20:52:06 <grym>	krz: yeah that's projectile-find-file; projectile's great 
Apr 18 20:52:06 <benny>	I need some guidance. To add a new feature to org-mode I need to have a function call send an additional parameter. How would I achieve that without breaking existing functions that only accept a single parameter?
Apr 18 20:52:17 <ayuce>	krz: not just for the find-file. you should read the readme, it explains a lot.
Apr 18 20:54:37 <white_magic>	can someone explain what are 'delta lines' in emacs window resizing functions? So they accept 'n' # of lines as a param?
Apr 18 20:55:55 <dale>	white_magic: Example function?
Apr 18 20:56:29 <stepnem>	white_magic: Yes. Generally, "delta" means difference.
Apr 18 20:56:32 <ayuce>	it's like +4 or -3
Apr 18 20:56:49 <white_magic>	dale: shrink-window-horizontally 
Apr 18 20:56:56 <white_magic>	stepnem: I know what delta means mathematically
Apr 18 20:57:21 <dale>	white_magic: Ah, yeah, it takes an argument to change the width by N columns I believe.
Apr 18 20:57:45 <white_magic>	More trying to understand what 'lines' refers to. If we're resizing vertically, it kinda makes sense. When resizing horizontally? Still 'n # of lines width" but think perpendicularly?
Apr 18 20:58:02 <stepnem>	It says columns here.
Apr 18 20:58:02 <dale>	white_magic: Docs here for shrink-window-horizontally says "columns" not "lines" in my docs?
Apr 18 20:58:14 <dale>	That is, in the function's docstring.
Apr 18 20:58:32 <white_magic>	yea I chose an emacs built-in function but I'm more interested in a spacemacs function that might be wrapping an original emacs function.. 1 second
Apr 18 21:00:06 <wasamasa>	contrapunctus[x]: you should expand to the function call, not execute it at compile-time
Apr 18 21:00:08 <white_magic>	"(spacemacs/shrink-window-horizontally DELTA)
Apr 18 21:00:08 <white_magic>	"
Apr 18 21:00:17 <wasamasa>	contrapunctus[x]: anyway, I still am convinced the macro is unnecessary
Apr 18 21:00:35 <white_magic>	spacemacs/shrink-window-horizontally is an interactive Lisp function in ‘../../keybindings.el’.
Apr 18 21:02:10 <white_magic>	I know how to use the function in a specific use case (I played around and found a 'delta' value that works for me) but I'm surprised that Spacemacs didn't document this function
Apr 18 21:06:23 <jayspeer>	seems the problem lays with magit-forge: Error (use-package): forge/:catch: Key sequence j p starts with non-prefix key j
Apr 18 21:10:10 <ayuce>	jayspeer: have you tried binding the j as a prefix key in that particular mode map.
Apr 18 21:10:16 <krz>	Which would you recommend more? Projectile with Helm or Ivy?
Apr 18 21:12:00 <dale>	krz: This is very much personal preference, but I prefer the speed and relative simplicity of Ivy.
Apr 18 21:13:01 <catacombs>	krz: ivy
Apr 18 21:13:59 <jayspeer>	hmmm this seems weird. I have forge installed via guix. But in my config I use use-package to config particular packages. When I remove (use-package forge) from my config everything seem to work just fine
Apr 18 21:15:32 <jayspeer>	scratch that. After removing this line from my init.el running forge-dispatch from magit-status brings up the problem again :confused:
Apr 18 21:16:18 <parsnip>	which problem? that j is a non-prefix key?
Apr 18 21:16:33 <parsnip>	maybe j is being bound elsewhere
Apr 18 21:17:35 <parsnip>	maybe evil or magit have bound j?
Apr 18 21:18:00 <parsnip>	what is doing the binding to j p?
Apr 18 21:18:22 <jayspeer>	parsnip: the thing is j is not bound by anything -- I'm not using evil
Apr 18 21:18:42 <parsnip>	jayspeer: what is doing the binding to j p
Apr 18 21:19:18 <parsnip>	clarify which map it's trying to do that on
Apr 18 21:19:45 <jayspeer>	parsnip: I've managed to get some more info, let me link you the paste real quick
Apr 18 21:19:46 <parsnip>	then clarify how you can test the binding of j on that map, once you've removed the j p binding for debugging purposes.
Apr 18 21:20:06 <parsnip>	then find out what is binding j
Apr 18 21:20:14 <parsnip>	QED
Apr 18 21:21:18 <jayspeer>	parsnip: https://paste.debian.net/1141196/
Apr 18 21:21:28 <white_magic>	can someone advise how I can switch to a buffer with a specific name? I found this: (switch-to-buffer-other-frame "NAME that matches the one in IBUFFER"). Do I need to write code that parses whatever the contents of 'ibuffer' are? I also have "persp-do-buffer-list-by-regexp" available but I don't know much about persp yet.
Apr 18 21:22:07 <parsnip>	jayspeer: i think the path i outlined above is the correct next step
Apr 18 21:22:18 <dale>	white_magic: Buffers have a name.  If you know the buffer's name, which your question kind of implies you do, then you just hand that to switch-to-buffer or switch-to-buffer-other-frame.
Apr 18 21:22:49 <dale>	white_magic: You can get a buffer's name with function (buffer-name).
Apr 18 21:22:50 <white_magic>	dale: I want to switch to one of the currently displayed frames (each of which has 1 buffer)
Apr 18 21:23:17 <dale>	white_magic: That sounds kind of different.
Apr 18 21:23:25 <parsnip>	hmm, in a magit buffer, j is undefined here
Apr 18 21:23:25 <white_magic>	yea a bit different
Apr 18 21:24:11 <dale>	white_magic: If you know that the buffer will be displayed in one of the windows of one of the frames then you can use get-buffer-window to find out which window it is in, then I think you can select the window and its frame with select-window.
Apr 18 21:24:13 <parsnip>	jayspeer: i don't know anything about forge, so you may have to approach this on your own. but here's a naive interpretation: if you disable forge, is j bound to anything in magit for you?
Apr 18 21:24:13 <jayspeer>	parsnip: that could be THE problem, since j is not a prefix to anything and it tried to map it as such, what do you think?
Apr 18 21:24:22 <jayspeer>	let me try
Apr 18 21:24:32 <ayuce>	i already told you what to do actually.
Apr 18 21:24:41 <parsnip>	jayspeer: usually a complaint that something is a non-prefix, is because it's bound to something itself
Apr 18 21:24:57 <jayspeer>	ayuce: sorry! missed that
Apr 18 21:25:01 <parsnip>	jayspeer: so if j is bound to a command in some map, then it can't be a prefix
Apr 18 21:25:28 <parsnip>	i didn't know that you can literally "bind as a prefix"
Apr 18 21:25:38 <parsnip>	i thought it was more about not binding itself
Apr 18 21:25:44 <ayuce>	yes, you can.
Apr 18 21:25:51 <jayspeer>	can you tell me how?
Apr 18 21:26:00 <ayuce>	using bind-key

Apr 18 21:37:19 <adam_erc>	Is wasamama in here?
Apr 18 21:37:48 <adam_erc>	I mean wasamasa. ugh!
Apr 18 21:38:20 <edgar-rft>	wasamama is wasamasa's mom
Apr 18 21:38:30 <adam_erc>	Haha
Apr 18 21:38:40 <bandali>	lol
Apr 18 21:39:24 <adam_erc>	Hey wasamasa. I just found your shackle packages on github. Nice work!
Apr 18 21:39:53 <krz>	Gah even with Ive/Projectile. Doesnt execute a fuzzy search in entire project dir... This is my setup https://gist.github.com/ecdf07bfd50a8297682b8fd378f3886d
Apr 18 21:40:01 <adam_erc>	Just what I needed for launching a shell from org-babel without getting bounced around ;)
Apr 18 21:40:17 <krz>	Ive=Ivy
Apr 18 21:41:13 <krz>	Or is this what everyone is used to 
Apr 18 21:41:54 <krz>	Its also strange there isnt much usage for FZF in the Emacs ecosystem
Apr 18 21:42:05 <adam_erc>	FZF?
Apr 18 21:42:17 <krz>	Alternative to AG
Apr 18 21:42:24 <edgar-rft>	AG?
Apr 18 21:42:25 <fsbot>	I heard ag is [0] A faster replacement for ack, which is "a code-searching tool, similar to grep but optimized for programmers searching large trees of source code.".

Apr 18 21:42:36 <adam_erc>	Ah
Apr 18 21:45:12 <adam_erc>	krz when I first migrated to org-mode from nvalt, I had it in my head to build a system around many small documents. I tried a lot of those tools, helm-org-rifle, etc.
Apr 18 21:45:33 <wgreenhouse>	,fzf
Apr 18 21:45:34 <fsbot>	wgreenhouse: Go on, don't be afraid. 
Apr 18 21:45:37 <parsnip>	so... i have my work laptop at home now. i connect to personal wifi, then use work vpn
Apr 18 21:45:52 <parsnip>	how much of my lan can they see?
Apr 18 21:46:06 <parsnip>	just ip addresses?
Apr 18 21:46:10 <parsnip>	no traffic, etc?
Apr 18 21:46:19 <jayspeer>	parsnip: as an admin, they can log everything
Apr 18 21:46:23 <krz>	adam_erc: And what happened?
Apr 18 21:46:26 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: depends how the vpn is configured 
Apr 18 21:46:48 <parsnip>	but can't the laptop see things outside of the vpn?
Apr 18 21:46:52 <adam_erc>	In the end, I settled on one orgmode document for my code library, one document for studies (in R/python/etc.), one for settings, etc. Each of these maps to multiple project folders. But this makes my searching easy!
Apr 18 21:47:03 <krz>	Because right now, there doesnt seem to be a suitable fuzzy finder library / package in Emacs. At least something that I was used to in Vim
Apr 18 21:47:06 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: sure can
Apr 18 21:47:13 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: Over wifi?
Apr 18 21:47:14 <jayspeer>	you're safe if you're using tls, since it's point to point
Apr 18 21:47:21 <technomancy>	parsnip: there's no reason to assume they've prevented that
Apr 18 21:47:45 <adam_erc>	I can find anything with helm-org-in-buffer-headers or just a quick search.
Apr 18 21:47:47 <parsnip>	right, so they might be monitoring other local ip addresses, "for security", i guess
Apr 18 21:47:55 <wgreenhouse>	jayspeer: most people have e.g. printers and crap inside their home network that don't use tls
Apr 18 21:48:11 <krz>	adam_erc: "searching easy". What are you doing exactly? With FZF setup with Vim. All I need to do is type out the keywords. And FZF is able to locate files that are matching. Regardless of which folders they are in
Apr 18 21:48:21 <parsnip>	i wonder if i can sandbox them
Apr 18 21:48:25 <krz>	Thats as easy as it can get
Apr 18 21:48:31 <krz>	But on Emacs, whole different ball game
Apr 18 21:48:42 <parsnip>	in hindsight, it's so creepy having work stuff at home
Apr 18 21:48:44 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: you can put the laptop in its own dmz if you like
Apr 18 21:48:49 <krz>	I have to tab my way into the right folder, before I can actually do a fuzzy search. Which defeats the purpose
Apr 18 21:48:53 <ayuce>	i bet emacs has fzf.
Apr 18 21:49:06 <krz>	Doubt it
Apr 18 21:49:08 <adam_erc>	krz orgmode is really meant to work with large documents. Thing document = repository/archive and header = project.
Apr 18 21:49:42 <adam_erc>	So if you are just searching within one document, it makes it so much easier to find things, not to mention linking and refactoring code, etc.
Apr 18 21:50:09 <aidalgol>	parsnip: If your laptop is going over wifi, and your router is running OpenWrt, you can set up a separate VLAN, with a separate wifi AP on that VLAN, that cannot see the rest of your home LAN's network.
Apr 18 21:50:13 <krz>	adam_erc: I have no intention of using orgmode atm. Especially, for programming
Apr 18 21:50:47 <adam_erc>	krz orgmode = the ultimate literate programming environment
Apr 18 21:51:00 <krz>	You sure about that?
Apr 18 21:51:13 <adam_erc>	krz it's like Jupyter Notebooks on steroids
Apr 18 21:51:31 <jayspeer>	that's an understatement IMO
Apr 18 21:51:48 <krz>	Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.
Apr 18 21:51:53 <krz>	From the site
Apr 18 21:52:06 <krz>	Doesnt sound like a environment for programming
Apr 18 21:52:09 <jayspeer>	krz: http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html 
Apr 18 21:52:10 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: take aidalgol's advice if this squicks you out
Apr 18 21:52:46 <adam_erc>	krz I maintain a code library in a single org document. Each top level header is a different language and within each I have different functions archived. Each gets tangled to different sources (or byte code) as needed. It absolutely rocks.
Apr 18 21:53:18 <adam_erc>	krz and it's literate, which means I can have code mixed in with math, notes, images, whatever I want/need.
Apr 18 21:53:25 <bbuccianti>	how can I find old gmane links like this http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/2963 ?
Apr 18 21:53:32 <parsnip>	okay thank you, will copy to notes, and try to parse asap. just waking up to coffee, didn't get much sleep first days on job
Apr 18 21:54:02 <adam_erc>	krz and if you want, it can even sync... with Jupyter
Apr 18 21:54:29 <wgreenhouse>	bbuccianti: I think you're SOL for now. Gmane migrated to new hosting and only supports nntp atm
Apr 18 21:54:56 <krz>	Cant I just load my project dir on Emacs and code away? I have to get Orgmode setup just to have some kind of decent fuzzy search going?
Apr 18 21:55:34 <ayuce>	krz: i am sure you will eventually find out there is fzf for emacs, right?
Apr 18 21:55:38 <bbuccianti>	wgreenhouse: there is some way of find that exact message using that number? or that is internal to gmane?
Apr 18 21:55:43 <jayspeer>	if you just want fuzzy searching in emacs, then helm is the way to go
Apr 18 21:55:44 <bbuccianti>	,SOL

Apr 18 21:55:51 <parsnip>	oh, i probably bought the proprietary modem/router thingy that the ISP suggested
Apr 18 21:55:53 <adam_erc>	krz if you are not using org-mode, you are missing 90% of the power behind emacs.
Apr 18 21:56:31 <parsnip>	one day i'd like to have a more privacy-loving, power-to-the-people, router/modem thingy
Apr 18 21:56:33 <adam_erc>	krz check out ESS and org-babel
Apr 18 21:57:35 <parsnip>	oh, i should bring it up in the group zooms with like 50 people
Apr 18 21:57:43 <wgreenhouse>	bbuccianti: internal to gmane afaik
Apr 18 21:57:45 <parsnip>	"fireside chat"
Apr 18 21:57:52 <bbuccianti>	,afaik
Apr 18 21:57:54 <fsbot>	bbuccianti: afaik: an initialism for "as far as i know"
Apr 18 21:58:01 <adam_erc>	with babel, you can embed code blocks in any language you want. And they can all talk to each other. You can make notes explaining what they do. And when you are ready, you can "tangle them", pulling out the code and output however you want.
Apr 18 21:58:13 <parsnip>	"hey isn't it weird we have our work computers roaming freely on our personal wifis?"
Apr 18 21:58:22 <bbuccianti>	wgreenhouse:  :(
Apr 18 21:58:29 <parsnip>	i think everyone will have either comcast or century link
Apr 18 21:58:47 <parsnip>	hmm, unless they live far enough away that it's a different set
Apr 18 21:59:17 <krz>	adam_erc: I dont need the whole literate aspect of orgmode. I just need to code efficiently
Apr 18 21:59:18 <aidalgol>	parsnip: I did, too, because it was easier to find a router-only device supported by OpenWrt, so my VDSL modem is used as just a modem, not a router.
Apr 18 21:59:19 <technomancy>	are you afraid they're going to print documents on your lan printer?
Apr 18 21:59:23 <aidalgol>	Not that this helps you much *now*.
Apr 18 21:59:40 <jayspeer>	krz: if I understand correctly you want to be able to fuzzy search with projectile, right?
Apr 18 21:59:49 <parsnip>	aidalgol: right, so temporarily, i would skip the openwrt route, i presume.
Apr 18 21:59:52 <jayspeer>	if so... helm-projectile
Apr 18 21:59:58 <adam_erc>	krz jayspeer is right. Checkout helm for speed and fuzzy searching.
Apr 18 21:59:58 <krz>	jayspeer: Omg
Apr 18 22:00:03 <krz>	So now back to helm
Apr 18 22:00:16 <aidalgol>	parsnip: Sadly, I doubt the modem's proprietary firmware gives you sufficient flexibility.
Apr 18 22:00:20 <parsnip>	i see links for "century link dmz" that i can research at some point
Apr 18 22:00:29 <wgreenhouse>	jayspeer: he just wants a fuzzy search that works identically to the one he used in vim
Apr 18 22:00:38 <technomancy>	I mean ... it's best to operate with the assumption that untrusted actors are on your home lan, right? you want to give guests access, but you don't trust them not to be rootkitted or whatever
Apr 18 22:00:43 <parsnip>	aidalgol: yeah, presumably the ISP does not want to aid too much in privacy
Apr 18 22:00:54 <parsnip>	or it's a special openwrt thing
Apr 18 22:00:59 <technomancy>	I don't see how a work laptop is any different
Apr 18 22:01:11 <krz>	wgreenhouse: not really. Most editors sublime, VS code. Will allow you to fuzzy search without having to go to the directory of the file
Apr 18 22:01:12 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: yeah, that's my approach, tbh
Apr 18 22:01:13 <dale>	krz: The Ivy equivalent of helm-projectile is counsel-projectile, I believe.
Apr 18 22:01:15 <dale>	krz: But wait
Apr 18 22:01:21 <krz>	You can be at the project directory and fuzzy search the file
Apr 18 22:01:39 <jayspeer>	krz: that's exactly how helm-projectile works
Apr 18 22:01:40 <parsnip>	good point
Apr 18 22:01:40 <dale>	krz: First have you made sure projectile-mode is actually on?
Apr 18 22:02:02 <parsnip>	i wouldn't want a friend's virus watching a printout of a 1040
Apr 18 22:02:04 <wgreenhouse>	krz: nonetheless, "find me something that works exactly like the vim package I used to use" won't really motivate anyone here
Apr 18 22:02:20 <dale>	krz: If your whole configuration is what you gave in your Gist, I think projectile-mode is going to be turned on, but check it.
Apr 18 22:02:21 <krz>	/foo/api/v1/controllers/bars_controller.rb. If Im in /foo. And I type "bar". Its likey bars_controller.rb will come up
Apr 18 22:02:39 <parsnip>	hmm, i should probably start using a personal vpn again anyways
Apr 18 22:02:48 <adam_erc>	I code primarily in R and shell script. But also python, applescript, F-Script, etc. Org-mode keeps everything tidy. Helm helps me move fast. Very fast. 
Apr 18 22:02:49 <jayspeer>	krz: helm-projectile :D for 1000x times - it does EXACTLY that
Apr 18 22:03:05 <technomancy>	what's f-script?
Apr 18 22:03:29 <jayspeer>	you don't have to use helm globally, just use it with projectile, or just bind only that function to some key
Apr 18 22:03:30 <ayuce>	fzf for emacs what he really wants but he doesnt' want to admit emacs has that.
Apr 18 22:03:36 <aidalgol>	parsnip: It's more that most vendors don't bother exposing everything through the shitty web UI.
Apr 18 22:03:44 <adam_erc>	technomancy it's an all but dead scripting language for automating Objective-C
Apr 18 22:03:44 <dale>	krz: Once you are sure you have projectile-mode turned on, does M-x projectile-project-info correctly identify that you're in a project, and is it the project root directory you expected?
Apr 18 22:04:04 <parsnip>	aidalgol: ah, so sort of, "laziness", or w/e
Apr 18 22:04:09 <aidalgol>	yeah
Apr 18 22:04:12 <krz>	ayuce: Be specific https://github.com/bling/fzf.el ?
Apr 18 22:04:21 <parsnip>	sort of like how netflix seems to be too lazy to let me pay via Simple bank
Apr 18 22:04:23 <dale>	krz: If projectile-mode is on, and your project is being correctly identified per projectile-project-info, make sure ivy-mode is on.  If all of that is true, what does projectile-find-file do?
Apr 18 22:04:24 <krz>	https://github.com/ibmandura/helm-fzf
Apr 18 22:04:32 <krz>	Both outdated, and nothing in the Readme
Apr 18 22:04:43 <dale>	(Also, fzf != ag)
Apr 18 22:04:43 <jayspeer>	you don't need the fzf part
Apr 18 22:04:59 <parsnip>	i wrote to the CEO. i will probably not be using netflix for a long time
Apr 18 22:05:13 *	aidalgol hands parsnip a pirate hat
Apr 18 22:05:15 <parsnip>	until i either change banks, bend backwards, or they fix it.
Apr 18 22:05:21 <krz>	dale: Problem I see with projectile, I believe it can only work if project is git initialized correct?
Apr 18 22:05:28 <ayuce>	krz: you don't need those to be updated regularly. it is not vimscript.
Apr 18 22:05:30 <parsnip>	yeah, i've been pirating, but i feel bad
Apr 18 22:05:33 <dale>	krz: Projectile supports lots of different project types, one sec.
Apr 18 22:05:39 <parsnip>	again, no vpn, etc
Apr 18 22:05:44 <dale>	krz: https://docs.projectile.mx/en/latest/projects/
Apr 18 22:06:01 <aidalgol>	technomancy: How goes the jam?
Apr 18 22:06:10 <parsnip>	i think it's the pirate /downloads/ that get on their radar more?
Apr 18 22:06:16 <jayspeer>	projectile can use any dir as a project afaik
Apr 18 22:06:18 <parsnip>	not sure if pirate streaming is as bad
Apr 18 22:06:24 <krz>	dale: Id like to be able to fuzzy search on just a "normal" directory as well
Apr 18 22:06:44 <dale>	krz: That, I don't know how to do in Emacs.
Apr 18 22:06:54 <ayuce>	dale: you can tell fzf to search using ag though.
Apr 18 22:07:07 <parsnip>	new job, lots of renovating to do, including all my software habits
Apr 18 22:07:12 <dale>	ayuce: What, it uses ag to just walk files in a directory?
Apr 18 22:07:38 <aidalgol>	parsnip: Oh yeah, it's much less of a risk here.  I stopped feeling bad the more I hit walls trying to just *buy* shit.
Apr 18 22:07:38 <parsnip>	in some ways, my first real job
Apr 18 22:07:38 <ayuce>	crazier things have happened.
Apr 18 22:07:38 <dale>	ayuce: I never considered that, it kind of makes sense.  Doesn't fzf also have its own directory traversal stuff, though?
Apr 18 22:08:01 *	parsnip nods
Apr 18 22:08:11 <jayspeer>	krz: I know how to do it! ...in helm >:)
Apr 18 22:08:17 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: when the opportunity arises, getting a wifi ap that is not your isp's modem (and preferably one whose OS you can configure) is a really good idea
Apr 18 22:08:24 <krz>	jayspeer: How?
Apr 18 22:08:27 *	parsnip nods
Apr 18 22:08:33 <technomancy>	aidalgol: engine is humming along nicely but not really sure if we'll get much plot/character stuff in
Apr 18 22:08:36 <adam_erc>	One of the benefits to literate programming is that when you are searching for something, your notes add context, which makes your keyword searches richer and more effective (i.e., fuzzy).
Apr 18 22:08:43 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: but also regarding your home wlan as totally insecure is also a good idea
Apr 18 22:08:43 <jayspeer>	helm-find-files then C-c /
Apr 18 22:08:45 <parsnip>	there's two physical devices i need?
Apr 18 22:08:55 <ayuce>	i used fzf inside vim, still using inside bash sometimes. it has a lot of stuff i haven't bothered to check.
Apr 18 22:09:00 <dale>	Uff, I'm going to have to install Helm to see what that actually does, aren't I.
Apr 18 22:09:06 <parsnip>	ah, router and ap
Apr 18 22:09:11 <dale>	Yeah, I have fzf set up in Bash.
Apr 18 22:10:13 <parsnip>	pk5001z
Apr 18 22:10:56 <parsnip>	"modem"
Apr 18 22:10:58 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: yeah that's my advice 
Apr 18 22:11:05 <parsnip>	"router/modem"
Apr 18 22:11:45 <parsnip>	so i can put the AP in between the computer and the ISP's thing?
Apr 18 22:11:49 <dale>	jayspeer: Interesting!  And it's just running find, by default at least.
Apr 18 22:11:53 <grym>	dale: z is also very nice
Apr 18 22:11:57 <grym>	for shell stuff
Apr 18 22:12:00 <dale>	grym: I also have that.
Apr 18 22:12:17 <grym>	dale: i have no idea how i lived without fzf and z tbh 
Apr 18 22:12:36 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: yep
Apr 18 22:12:42 <dale>	I guess that's helm-ff-run-find-sh-command.
Apr 18 22:12:53 <grym>	dale: until i showed it to him my coworker had about 400 lines in his .bashrc of aliases for common directories he maintained by hand 
Apr 18 22:12:58 <dale>	jayspeer: Does it always start at /?
Apr 18 22:13:05 <parsnip>	thank you
Apr 18 22:13:51 <jayspeer>	dale: I've just found this feature, but I believe it starts from where you're currently are
Apr 18 22:14:28 <dale>	jayspeer: Ah, you're right, I accidentally moved to / before I did it.
Apr 18 22:14:52 <jayspeer>	dale: "C-c /" just calles the find from helm ff
Apr 18 22:15:28 <jayspeer>	krz: can you tell us if this is up to your needs?
Apr 18 22:16:10 <dale>	krz: Huh, if you have Ivy and Counsel installed, have you tried M-x counsel-fzf?
Apr 18 22:17:08 <krz>	Let me check, but I believe I tried that already
Apr 18 22:17:10 <wgreenhouse>	parsnip: I actually bought my own cable modem too--because I tired of paying a stupid rental fee to the ISP
Apr 18 22:17:12 <dale>	krz: Run it with C-u prefix and I think it'll ask you which directory to start in, rather than the current directory.
Apr 18 22:17:42 <refusenick>	Anyone here use Stumpwm with Slynk instead of Swank?
Apr 18 22:18:10 <refusenick>	(I installed Stumpwm on the other laptop because some GTK apps inexplicably fail to load in EXWM when I need them to work)
Apr 18 22:19:36 <dale>	krz: There is also counsel-find-jump, which seems like it's like Helm's helm-ff-run-find-sh-command, at least under default configurations.
Apr 18 22:22:19 <lampilelo>	there is also helm-for-files that uses locate to search through the filesystem
Apr 18 22:24:47 <lampilelo>	and helm-grep-do-git-grep and helm-do-grep-ag
Apr 18 22:25:03 <dale>	Ivy equivalent: counsel-locate
Apr 18 22:25:43 <lampilelo>	counsel has a lot of functions that use different backends for searching like ag, rg, etc.
Apr 18 22:25:44 <dale>	lampilelo: Those last two are used for searching for files by their content, right?
Apr 18 22:25:51 <lampilelo>	yes
Apr 18 22:26:03 <dale>	Yeah, I think there's counsel-git-grep and counsel-ag.
Apr 18 22:26:04 <krz>	dale: When I type M-x, I get ivy-configure: Keyword argument :init-fn not one of (:initial-input :height :occur :update-fn :unwind-fn :index-fn :sort-fn :format-fn :display-transformer-fn :more-chars :grep-p :exit-codes)
Apr 18 22:26:10 <krz>	Any idea why?
Apr 18 22:27:48 <dale>	krz: I do not, sorry.  My first guess is something in your config is wrong.
Apr 18 22:33:41 <aidalgol>	rudybot: Does this docstring make my butt look big?
Apr 18 22:33:42 <rudybot>	aidalgol: I have a male vibrator because I like putting stuff up my butt.
Apr 18 22:33:54 <aidalgol>	offby1: *cough*...
Apr 18 22:37:37 <holomorph>	( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Apr 18 22:38:55 <parsnip>	wgreenhouse: oh, i bought the ISP thing out of the gate, simple math. not sure if buying /theirs/ was the best choice, but i've had it for years, so w/e
Apr 18 22:39:30 <parsnip>	i actually bought the competitor ISP monolith thingy too
Apr 18 22:39:45 <parsnip>	i had their service for a few months, can't remember why i switched.
Apr 18 22:39:53 <catacombs>	is there a way to force mu4e to display text as plain text?
Apr 18 22:40:50 <technomancy>	catacombs: . will show the raw msg I think?
Apr 18 22:43:26 <catacombs>	ah, yes it does
Apr 18 22:43:46 <catacombs>	thanks. dear lord, opening an html in raw is really ugly
Apr 18 22:43:58 <technomancy>	prepare the eye bleach
Apr 18 22:43:59 <catacombs>	no wonder plain text is preferred
Apr 18 22:44:48 <bremner>	catacombs: do you mean with multipart/alternative, or a pure html message?
Apr 18 22:46:18 <catacombs>	bremner: no pure html
Apr 18 22:46:21 <catacombs>	just plain text
Apr 18 22:46:39 <catacombs>	doesn't seem it's possible if the email is mostly html
Apr 18 22:46:45 <catacombs>	it'll show all the code
Apr 18 22:47:02 <bremner>	well, you can render it down somehow I'm sure. But it will be imperfect
Apr 18 22:47:16 <bremner>	I mean, even more imperfect than eww
Apr 18 22:52:24 <catacombs>	true. i'll just deal with it for now. thanks

Apr 18 23:00:58 <bandali>	technomancy, are you volunteering? :-p
Apr 18 23:01:06 <technomancy>	lol
Apr 18 23:01:19 <technomancy>	uh
Apr 18 23:01:19 <technomancy>	busy with my lisp jam sorry =)
Apr 18 23:01:58 <bandali>	hehe np, kidding mostly
Apr 18 23:03:05 <bandali>	i think ikiwiki checks out like 99% of the boxes except for lack of online password-less edits
Apr 18 23:03:57 <bremner>	bandali: there's a bunch of more recent static site generators like hugo. Do those not work for you?
Apr 18 23:04:23 <bremner>	I keep using ikiwiki because I've got custom extensions, but I'm not sure it's the obvious choice
Apr 18 23:06:33 <bandali>	bremner, i want something wiki-like that allows easy edits in the browser. in the context of emacsconf specifically
Apr 18 23:06:40 <lampilelo>	omg linker errors, my favorite kind
Apr 18 23:07:20 <bandali>	i'd use an ssg for emacsconf but i want to allow people to easily edit the pages in their browser if they wish
Apr 18 23:07:39 <bandali>	the current oddmuse setup allows that, but its has its own shortcomings and i have a few gripes with it
Apr 18 23:11:53 <bandali>	ah nice, i just saw https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/anonok/
Apr 18 23:12:17 <bandali>	now only if there's a way to put some sort of security question in front of that to fend off some spam
Apr 18 23:18:09 <bbuccianti>	please don't add a captcha
Apr 18 23:18:14 <bbuccianti>	:D
Apr 18 23:21:20 <bandali>	it won't be a real "captcha", as in the proprietary shit from google or other services
Apr 18 23:21:32 <bandali>	more like a text box with a label like "say hello" or some such
Apr 18 23:26:41 <hodapp>	rudybot: tempeh is better than tofu
Apr 18 23:26:47 <rudybot>	hodapp: tempeh > tofu
Apr 18 23:26:50 <hodapp>	\o/
Apr 18 23:26:52 <hodapp>	YOU ALL SAW IT
Apr 18 23:31:59 <krz>	Finally got it to work with FZF!
Apr 18 23:33:43 <ayuce>	bandali: why not a dynamic one?
Apr 18 23:34:05 <bandali>	ayuce, a dynamic what?
Apr 18 23:34:13 <krz>	Is counsel part of Ivy?
Apr 18 23:34:19 <ayuce>	a website.
Apr 18 23:34:23 <bandali>	krz, yes
Apr 18 23:34:54 <bandali>	ayuce, i prefer to keep things simple. though, technically speaking, ikiwiki used with its cgi is actually dynamic
Apr 18 23:35:03 <bandali>	somewhat
Apr 18 23:40:19 <ayuce>	i have looked ikiwiki but couldn't see what you asked for in plugins, unfortunately.
Apr 18 23:41:38 <bandali>	thanks, appreciate it
Apr 18 23:41:46 <bandali>	it's not *that* big a deal
Apr 18 23:42:00 <bandali>	worst case, i'll just keep an eye and revert spam manually
Apr 18 23:45:53 <ayuce>	alright, then.
Apr 19 00:08:29 <shukryzablah>	what does emacs use for the gui?
Apr 19 00:23:13 <terpri>	shukryzablah, typically gtk, but it supports several toolkits
Apr 19 00:28:23 <bpalmer>	rudybot: have some swiss chard and beans instead
Apr 19 00:28:27 <rudybot>	bpalmer: appreciation for swiss chard's coloring
Apr 19 00:37:45 <hodapp>	rudybot: this swiss chard isn't even FROM sweden, you lying sack of shite
Apr 19 00:37:54 <rudybot>	hodapp: celery, spinach, most meats, chard.
Apr 19 00:38:44 *	bpalmer gently steers hodapp towards switzerland
Apr 19 00:41:41 <holomorph>	,chards
Apr 19 00:41:42 <fsbot>	FRICASEE HIM!!
Apr 19 00:43:10 <Plazma>	rudybot: big meat
Apr 19 00:43:10 <rudybot>	Plazma: Also not a big fan of raw meat, no matter how many times they tell me I should it raw
Apr 19 00:43:26 <Plazma>	,qualuudes
Apr 19 00:43:28 <fsbot>	Plazma: You couldn't ssh your way out of a wet paper bag.
Apr 19 00:43:34 <Plazma>	true
Apr 19 00:56:03 <refusenick>	I remember reading that gccemacs recently got an update so that only a core needs to be compiled with Make and the rest can be compiled as-needed.
Apr 19 00:56:22 <refusenick>	What should I use as configure options? The first time, it took >12 hours
Apr 19 01:00:16 <refusenick>	Specifically, I'd like to disable alternative languages and input methods (the "leim/quail" directory took the longest by far; the Chinese quail methods were particularly egregious offenders, for understandable reasons)
Apr 19 01:02:57 <refusenick>	I need to go, but want to start the compile before I leave. Any ideas?
Apr 19 01:12:12 <refusenick>	helloooo
Apr 19 01:13:28 <grym>	 screen and -j $(nproc) ? 
Apr 19 01:14:31 <refusenick>	??

Apr 19 01:50:16 <shukryzablah>	is it a common thing for older people to have a safe deposit box at a bank? 
Apr 19 01:50:25 <parsnip>	rudybot: when you're quiet, you're not wrong
Apr 19 01:50:29 <rudybot>	parsnip: dont tell me I'm wrong AND to be quiet you uneducated commy
Apr 19 01:51:37 <bandali>	,told parsnip
Apr 19 01:51:37 <fsbot>	Awww! parsnip got *told*!
Apr 19 01:52:38 <grym>	shukryzablah: i feel like it's getting rarer
Apr 19 01:53:28 <shukryzablah>	grym: gnupg manual uses it as an example and it got me wondering
Apr 19 01:54:51 <grym>	shukryzablah: for instance, i have a credit union which doesn't even have such a thing 
Apr 19 01:55:00 <grym>	and your privacy guarantees are actually not great there
Apr 19 01:58:03 <parsnip>	rudybot: but the police call it, "being uncooperative"
Apr 19 01:58:21 <rudybot>	parsnip: It could also suspend any uncooperative process that's allocating pages until the cooperative processes have disposed of excess pages.
Apr 19 01:59:05 <parsnip>	rudybot: i'm not a knight, so i don't have any pages. and even if i was, seems a bit harsh to dispose of them.
Apr 19 01:59:32 <rudybot>	parsnip: I have to make sure his fiery appearances are safe, and dispose of the fish into which he turns the baseball bats that people brandish to defend themselves.
Apr 19 02:00:06 *	parsnip slaps rudybot with a fish
Apr 19 02:01:13 <shukryzablah>	something i like about emacs is that it makes it easy to learn or become better at command line tools, e.g. git, gpg
Apr 19 02:03:45 <grym>	i'm not so convinced of that 
Apr 19 02:03:58 <grym>	but it does sit firmly in the old school unix toolchain tradition 
Apr 19 02:11:34 <rpav>	dunno, it's hard to seen now, but i remember when emacs was one of those weird complicated cool unix programs
Apr 19 02:20:30 <grym>	rpav: that's certainly my view of it still 
Apr 19 02:20:40 <grym>	that and "one of the two actual editors"
Apr 19 02:20:54 <lampilelo>	i think it was Linus Thorvalds who said that Emacs is in opposite of unix philosophy
Apr 19 02:21:15 <lampilelo>	because it tries to solve every problem in one application
Apr 19 02:21:38 <shukryzablah>	i'm saying it bc for example this gpg thing. the only reason i learn about that tool is bc i discover its emacs frontend. 
Apr 19 02:21:40 <grym>	that's `find` :D 
Apr 19 02:21:46 <grym>	lampilelo: ^ 
Apr 19 02:22:08 <grym>	anyway, emacs is about as old as unix, and they certainly grew up/around/into and out of each other together 
Apr 19 02:23:45 <grym>	nevermind that teco started on ITS
Apr 19 02:23:57 <rpav>	dunno, it's definitely still complicated, but less weird/etc
Apr 19 02:25:15 <rpav>	i think some of the other recent-ish editors are vaguely legit, but obviously can't catch up quickly to decades of development
Apr 19 02:25:34 <grym>	what's that line from 'in the beginning was the command line'... 
Apr 19 02:26:06 <grym>	"In other words, the engineer-hours that, in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda, were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively simple-seeming problem of editing text. "
Apr 19 02:26:54 <lampilelo>	rpav: vscode is catching up very fast, it's written in typescript and there is A LOT of js programmers out there
Apr 19 02:27:08 <grym>	lampilelo: it is in fact why there is a typescript at all 
Apr 19 02:32:51 <rpav>	lampilelo: yeah .. if it didn't have the same weird deficiency most editors seem to (i.e. a process for every frame or whatever with no shared vm/etc) i'd even consider using it, but
Apr 19 02:33:18 <rpav>	this seems to afflict everything but some IDEs and emacs
Apr 19 02:33:53 <rpav>	though these days emacs is the nicest/easiest-to-hack irc client i can find so i'd use it anyway, but
Apr 19 02:34:27 <lampilelo>	it's based on electron, i think? 
Apr 19 02:36:02 <rpav>	yeah
Apr 19 02:36:15 <rpav>	though i'm not sure what hacks they use because it's actually pretty snappy vs atom
Apr 19 02:38:11 <lampilelo>	i guess microsoft has some good engineers
Apr 19 02:38:49 <technomancy>	I heard they replaced a bunch of JS with native code or something
Apr 19 02:49:13 <lampilelo>	i wonder how will it manage in the next decade or two, it's probably an emacs of the new generation
Apr 19 02:49:29 <lampilelo>	but worse because javascript
Apr 19 02:50:23 <ayuce>	what is?
Apr 19 02:50:41 <lampilelo>	vscode
Apr 19 02:50:55 <ayuce>	oh, it's just an editor.
Apr 19 02:51:05 <michaelrose>	is there liable to be anything done in vs code that can't be simply copied back to emacs?
Apr 19 02:52:36 <grym>	rpav: the hack was "invent typescript"
Apr 19 02:52:41 <grym>	(really)
Apr 19 02:53:30 <technomancy>	michaelrose: embedding a whole browser engine, I guess =)
Apr 19 02:53:52 <lampilelo>	and concurrency can't be copied too
Apr 19 02:54:07 <lampilelo>	at least not easily
Apr 19 02:54:12 <bbuccianti>	vscode has concurrency?
Apr 19 02:54:18 <bbuccianti>	I mean, js has it?
Apr 19 02:54:26 <bbuccianti>	s/has/have

Apr 19 12:52:05 <abralek>	Hi
Apr 19 12:52:49 <abralek>	I am trying to install emacs-ts package https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el using guix
Apr 19 12:53:04 <abralek>	but tests are failing 
Apr 19 12:53:05 <abralek>	with http://paste.debian.net/1141304
Apr 19 12:53:54 <abralek>	so basically (equal 31622399 31622400) are failing
Apr 19 12:54:10 <abralek>	And I am not sure is that leap second or what
Apr 19 13:22:51 <giorgian>	I installed emacs-mac (the Macport) via homebrew, and now SVG images work, but ns-transparent-titlebar, which I had just learned about, doesn't.
Apr 19 13:28:01 <ecbrown>	giorgian: i use mitsuharu emacs on my mac (i.e. the macports you discovered)
Apr 19 13:28:13 <ecbrown>	with +imagemagick +rsvg and the multitty fix
Apr 19 13:28:36 <adam_erc>	Anybody here use org-mode?
Apr 19 13:28:47 <ecbrown>	pretty much everyone here at one time or another
Apr 19 13:28:53 <ecbrown>	,ask
Apr 19 13:28:54 <fsbot>	Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help.
Apr 19 13:28:57 <adam_erc>	Fastastic!
Apr 19 13:29:16 <adam_erc>	How can I get org-edit-special to respect my header-args?
Apr 19 13:29:28 <giorgian>	ecbrown: does ns-trasparent-titlebar works? not that it matters that much, but I does look nice
Apr 19 13:30:04 <ecbrown>	i really don't know.  if so, i'd probably turn them off
Apr 19 13:30:21 <adam_erc>	ecbrown Here is the issue I'm https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/57904/get-ess-eval-to-respect-org-babel-header-args
Apr 19 13:30:22 <ecbrown>	don't want background stuff leaking into my panels
Apr 19 13:31:43 <ecbrown>	mac port has some nice font rendering, but wow linux version is tons more stable when "rocking and rolling"
Apr 19 13:32:55 <giorgian>	ecbrown: I'm sure the linux version is better for a lot of reasons, but I haven't bought a computer in about twelve years and all my employers have since given me macbooks
Apr 19 13:33:27 <adam_erc>	When I set the :dir argument and run an org-babel block with C-c C-c it works as expected. But when I execude the same code from org-edit-special, the :dir argument is completely ignored...?
Apr 19 13:33:48 <krz>	How do I get emacs to move the cursor to last change position? Im using https://github.com/emacs-evil/goto-chg/blob/master/goto-chg.el which works with "goto-last-change". However, when I close / reopen emacs, "goto-last-change" doesnt remember the last changed position
Apr 19 13:33:50 <adam_erc>	How can I fix this?
Apr 19 13:34:32 <adam_erc>	krz have you tried saving your desktop?
Apr 19 13:34:38 <adam_erc>	when you exit
Apr 19 13:34:59 <ecbrown>	giorgian: cool, yeah, i use mitsuharu from macports.  also have a vm on each computer with debian or guix, and ssh the frames into Xquartz
Apr 19 13:35:51 <ecbrown>	if you have a chiclet macbook this would suck
Apr 19 13:35:56 <krz>	(desktop-save-mode 1) ?
Apr 19 13:36:27 <adam_erc>	krz yeah, try that
Apr 19 13:37:25 <ecbrown>	adam_erc: interesting question
Apr 19 13:37:48 <krz>	adam_erc: Yea that doesnt do what I need. It just remembers the cursor position
Apr 19 13:37:58 <ecbrown>	adam_erc: i use ess and org mode, but never in this integrated "single source" way
Apr 19 13:38:07 <krz>	goto-last-change returns: Buffer has not been changed
Apr 19 13:38:21 <krz>	When I reopen emacs
Apr 19 13:38:57 <giorgian>	ecbrown: thank you, I'll study mitsuharu. I'll consider a vm, but isn't Xqartz horrible? 
Apr 19 13:39:49 <ecbrown>	well, it's not a comfy desktop manager.  but i just lay out my windows and go to work
Apr 19 13:39:51 <adam_erc>	ecbrown hmm... was hoping it was an issue with my config.
Apr 19 13:40:26 <adam_erc>	krz hmm... not sure, sorry.
Apr 19 13:40:32 <krz>	Do I need undo-tree or something?
Apr 19 13:41:08 <adam_erc>	krz hey one thing you can try is to run bookmark-set
Apr 19 13:41:35 <adam_erc>	then when you reload your document run bookmark-jump
Apr 19 13:41:56 <adam_erc>	If you have helm installed, this is effortless. But you can also assign keyboard shortcuts.
Apr 19 13:42:00 <krz>	Im referring to changes
Apr 19 13:42:13 <krz>	In vim. This is equivalent to '.
Apr 19 13:42:17 <krz>	Not bookmarks
Apr 19 13:42:26 <adam_erc>	krz yeah, it's a manual process. You would just have to bookmark the last changed line before quitting
Apr 19 13:42:42 <adam_erc>	krz might be some other way though...
Apr 19 13:44:57 <lampilelo>	krz: why do you close emacs in the first place? you can run it as a server and connect with emacsclient and if you don't want to, there is always C-z if you're on a terminal
Apr 19 13:48:45 <adam_erc>	krz maybe this could help https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2985050/is-there-any-way-to-have-emacs-save-your-undo-history-between-sessions
Apr 19 13:48:47 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/ZBdhIqNun7
Apr 19 13:51:27 <ecbrown>	giorgian: also, clipboard integration is far superior in mitsuharu
Apr 19 13:51:34 <ecbrown>	font rendering is nicer
Apr 19 13:51:47 <ecbrown>	though printing is still shit
Apr 19 13:52:14 <adam_erc>	krz try adding this to your init (setq undo-tree-mode t)
Apr 19 13:52:27 <adam_erc>	See https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/51410/saving-undo-tree-to-restore-in-next-session
Apr 19 13:58:29 <krz>	Hmmm let me try a few of these suggestions
Apr 19 14:12:13 <fnstudio>	hi, i was thinking of moving my `.emacs.d/` folder to `.config/emacs/` but that doesn't seem to work
Apr 19 14:12:28 <fnstudio>	i'm on GNU Emacs 26.3 on a Debian system
Apr 19 14:13:35 <fnstudio>	any idea if this emacs version is XDG-compliant?
Apr 19 14:14:14 <lampilelo>	fnstudio: it's not, you have to wait for emacs 27 for that
Apr 19 14:14:48 <fnstudio>	lampilelo: oh i see, that's fine then, it's just a minor thing, thanks for letting me know
Apr 19 14:17:22 <codingquark>	I wrote 2 blog posts in 2 days.
Apr 19 14:17:25 <adam_erc>	fnstudio couldn't you just hard link between the two?
Apr 19 14:17:34 <codingquark>	I don't do that, generally. Because I cannot.
Apr 19 14:17:55 <codingquark>	I will now branch out my .emacs.d to run on Termux on android.
Apr 19 14:19:23 <adam_erc>	fnstudio something like ln -l ~/.config/emacs ~/.emacs.d
Apr 19 14:20:22 <adam_erc>	fnstudio just don't do this if ~/.emacs.d already exists!
Apr 19 14:20:53 <fnstudio>	adam_erc: yes, sure, that's an option, but my objective was to declutter my home folder and if i end up having a symlink i guess i can as well leave the entire thing there
Apr 19 14:20:55 <adam_erc>	fnstudio mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.config/emacs
Apr 19 14:21:14 <fnstudio>	adam_erc: but thanks for suggesting that
Apr 19 14:22:58 <adam_erc>	fnstudio how about (setq user-emacs-directory "~/.config/emacs")
Apr 19 14:23:31 <adam_erc>	https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsDotD
Apr 19 14:24:56 <sam_c>	lampilelo: guix looks good too. that sounds fair, but if you ever wanna try it and need anything, lmk
Apr 19 14:29:50 <lampilelo>	sam_c: sure thing, thanks
Apr 19 14:32:10 <sam_c>	:)
Apr 19 14:32:53 <fnstudio>	adam_erc: that's also an interesting option, but that would also need to be "bootstrapped" as part of `~/.emacs.d/init.el`, i suppose
Apr 19 14:42:26 <adam_erc>	fnstudio try running it and then restarting. There are some processes that run before init. And I believe this variable may get loaded by one of them...
Apr 19 14:47:03 <adam_erc>	fnstudio hmm... does this help? https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/4253/how-to-start-emacs-with-a-custom-user-emacs-directory/4255
Apr 19 14:47:46 <lxsameer>	hey folks, does melpa stable keeps the older version of packages as well ?
Apr 19 14:48:56 <fnstudio>	adam_erc: it definitely helps, thanks for the link and the previous tips, really appreciated!
Apr 19 14:49:26 <adam_erc>	fnstudio no worries!
Apr 19 14:49:38 <fnstudio>	adam_erc: using an alias could be the cleaner solution (in my specific context, i mean)
Apr 19 14:51:06 <adam_erc>	fnstudio yeah. Also keep in mind that .emacs.d is hidden. So you normally would not see the alias inside ~/ anyway...
Apr 19 14:51:37 <fnstudio>	yes, sure, that's also true
Apr 19 14:54:03 <adam_erc>	Can anybody here tell me how to get org-edit-special to respect my header-args? I have an org-babel code block where I set #+BEGIN_SRC R :dir ~/test But when I run org-edit-special and ess-eval-line on getwd() I get back my default working directory...
Apr 19 14:54:37 <adam_erc>	Here it is in detail: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/57904/get-ess-eval-to-respect-org-babel-header-args
Apr 19 14:55:08 <adam_erc>	But if I just execute the code block with C-c C-c it works as expected
Apr 19 15:13:21 <holomorph>	this square emacs thread on e-d is bumpin. glad i'm not reading it
Apr 19 15:15:47 <edgar-rft>	e-d?
Apr 19 15:15:48 <fsbot>	[->] From memory, emacs-devel is [0] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/emacs-devel ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 19 15:16:50 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: how much is e-d related to ed(1)?
Apr 19 15:16:59 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: obviously I'm being a bit facetious since vim is of course related to ed, but several generations away.
Apr 19 15:24:31 <Guiri>	I've having trouble using [RET] to send the current line in ESS to the R eval.  I think it's because I'm using Evil mode.  I wasn't sure if there's a fix.  I didn't see Evil mode caveats come up in the ESS docs but maybe I didn't look in the right place.
Apr 19 16:18:21 <rednaZ>	Is there a place, where I can look up standard elisp functions?
Apr 19 16:21:26 <rednaZ>	How come the emacs documentation tells you to rebind keys interactively with global-set-key and local-set-key but in elisp code with global-set-key and define-key? Does this question make sense?
Apr 19 16:22:11 <rednaZ>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rebinding.html#Rebinding and https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding
Apr 19 16:24:25 <ecbrown>	>
Apr 19 16:30:51 <lxsameer>	hey folks, is there any function to parse the header section of a elisp file ?
Apr 19 16:33:47 <Xeteen>	so I did sudo apt-get install elpa-markdown-mode in Ubuntu but markdown-mode seems not to be installed ?
Apr 19 16:34:06 <Xeteen>	and at this point I don't know what I'm even doing and emacs looks beautiful but I'm lost :D
Apr 19 16:35:25 <Xeteen>	basically I'm doing M-x markdown-mode and it says [No match] so I'm assuming installing markdown-mode from apt didn't help
Apr 19 16:36:08 <Xeteen>	all I needed is to edit a markdown file and now I'm down the rabbit hole lol
Apr 19 17:06:19 <rednaZ>	How can I stop a mode from overriding my global-set-key from my init file with a local binding?
Apr 19 17:14:07 <technomancy>	Xeteen: I remember ages ago there was a bug in markdown-mode where it was missing the autoload
Apr 19 17:14:26 <technomancy>	so you needed to (require 'markdown-mode) yourself before it would load
Apr 19 17:15:58 <Xeteen>	technomancy: well I tried doing M-x markdown-mode but the package is not there
Apr 19 17:16:12 <technomancy>	yeah that's what I said; you have to require it first
Apr 19 17:16:18 <Xeteen>	ohhh sorry
Apr 19 17:16:30 <technomancy>	=)
Apr 19 17:16:54 <technomancy>	(that's a bug I ran into a long time ago; may or may not be what's causing it on your system)
Apr 19 17:17:15 <Xeteen>	do I have to put that into some init file or something?
Apr 19 17:17:19 <Xeteen>	something I'm asking the obvious here
Apr 19 17:17:32 <technomancy>	just to test it out, try M-: and enter it there first
Apr 19 17:17:41 <technomancy>	no sense in adding it to your init if it doesn't actually work
Apr 19 17:17:44 <Xeteen>	I head something about packages.el and things like that but I don't have such files in ~/.emacs.d
Apr 19 17:17:47 <Xeteen>	okay let me try
Apr 19 17:18:20 <rednaZ>	How can I override a local mode binding?
Apr 19 17:18:30 <rednaZ>	How can I override a local mode key binding?
Apr 19 17:19:23 <Xeteen>	technomancy: uhmm it responded "markdown-mode" and that's it
Apr 19 17:19:40 <Xeteen>	technomancy: yay!
Apr 19 17:19:41 <Xeteen>	it did it
Apr 19 17:19:41 <technomancy>	Xeteen: right so now that it's loaded, M-x markdown-mode should work
Apr 19 17:19:44 <technomancy>	cool!
Apr 19 17:19:49 *	Xeteen hugs technomancy 
Apr 19 17:20:43 <Xeteen>	okay I'll trying adding that to ~/.emacs and see how it goes
Apr 19 17:20:56 <technomancy>	M-x thumbs-up
Apr 19 17:21:02 <bremner>	M-x no-u
Apr 19 17:21:38 <bremner>	hm. that expands to a notmuch command for me
Apr 19 17:22:26 <technomancy>	expands to M-x hanoi-unix here
Apr 19 17:22:35 *	technomancy o O ( "why unix tho?" )
Apr 19 17:23:14 <Xeteen>	any idea why C-x C-c doesn't exit?
Apr 19 17:23:17 <technomancy>	ah, based on unix epoch I guess
Apr 19 17:24:18 <giorgian>	Hi. What's the easiest way to open files in certain paths (for instance, ~/.emacs.d/elpa) as read only by default?
Apr 19 17:24:57 <Xeteen>	technomancy: added to ~/.emacs and now it works automatically on startup, thanks
Apr 19 17:25:05 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: make a minor mode with a custom keymap and load it globally
Apr 19 17:25:24 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: Thank you.
Apr 19 17:26:52 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: Can it not be done with hooks without making a whole new minor mode?
Apr 19 17:27:40 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: That is what https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding suggests at the bottom. And it works unless the mode defines that key alread.
Apr 19 17:29:04 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: with hooks you typically change bindings locally
Apr 19 17:29:31 <lampilelo>	there are key binding conventions in emacs: (info "(elisp) Key Binding Conventions")
Apr 19 17:31:30 <ayuce>	giorgian: putting a .dir-locals.el in that directory.
Apr 19 17:31:40 <rednaZ>	What is the difference between my goal and "change bindings locally"?
Apr 19 17:31:53 <rednaZ>	Thank you for the conventions.
Apr 19 17:32:24 <giorgian>	ayuce: ok, thank you
Apr 19 17:33:14 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: you said you bound something globally and a mode overwrote it, if you'd solve it with adding a hook you'd be repeating your code
Apr 19 17:33:56 <lampilelo>	what if another mode overwrites it too? another hook?
Apr 19 17:36:32 <rednaZ>	Ah, I was not sure if you are just responding to my question "How can I override a local mode key binding?" or if you considered previous too. You are totally right of course. The thing is in my desperation I have already accepted the unelegant solution of repeating my code but even that did not work.
Apr 19 17:37:59 <rednaZ>	I had tried inside a hook '(local-set-key (kbd "<backtab>")' and '(define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "<backtab>")'. Neither worked.
Apr 19 17:38:50 <ayuce>	if you are using use package you can bind it with * feature like bind* or bind_key*. i don't know any other way though.
Apr 19 17:40:42 <ayuce>	s/bind_/bind-
Apr 19 17:42:03 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: you mean (local-set-key (kbd "<backtab>") 'my-function)? it should work
Apr 19 17:45:07 <rednaZ>	Ah, it is not the major mode to define <backtab> but a minor mode.
Apr 19 17:45:19 <rednaZ>	That is, why it does not work.
Apr 19 17:45:35 <rednaZ>	So how do I override the minor mode key binding?
Apr 19 17:50:07 <lampilelo>	hmm, i guess with a hook to that minor mode? :D
Apr 19 17:52:52 <lampilelo>	we've gone a full circle
Apr 19 17:57:00 <miskatonic>	also not confused with dzen2
Apr 19 17:57:15 <miskatonic>	ooops wrong channel
Apr 19 17:57:25 <lampilelo>	what's dzen2?
Apr 19 17:57:44 <miskatonic>	dzen2 is a statusbar for x11
Apr 19 17:57:58 <rednaZ>	Your reasoning about using custom minor modes to rebind keys because you might discover collisions with mode key bindings in the future applies to all custom global key bindings even if there is no collision yet. So why does https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-Rebinding.html#Init-Rebinding tell me to use global-set-key?
Apr 19 17:58:03 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: ^
Apr 19 18:01:54 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: hook to that minor mode does not work. :( Nothing works.
Apr 19 18:01:55 <lampilelo>	because ideally, with global-set-key you'd use a binding that won't have collisions, and modes override global map
Apr 19 18:02:56 <lampilelo>	so what do you want to bound to what mode? maybe we'll figure it out
Apr 19 18:03:00 <lampilelo>	bind*
Apr 19 18:06:37 <rednaZ>	https://gist.github.com/prednaz/4369b905ac29ddcae537542571afa707
Apr 19 18:08:25 <rednaZ>	And an extract from haskell-indentation.el: https://gist.github.com/prednaz/ec6ff0b984c38a77f6d025d8ed0c6524
Apr 19 18:08:44 <lampilelo>	i think it doesn't work because haskell provides its own function for indentation
Apr 19 18:09:07 <lampilelo>	at least it's the first thing that comes to mind
Apr 19 18:10:14 <rednaZ>	And I want to override it.
Apr 19 18:10:59 <lampilelo>	then use function you want to put in its place in a binding, because indent-for-tab-command calls the function haskell had set up
Apr 19 18:11:29 <rednaZ>	I would be fine with that. But it does not.
Apr 19 18:11:50 <rednaZ>	It keeps calling what is defined in haskell-indentation.el .
Apr 19 18:12:10 <rednaZ>	(https://gist.github.com/prednaz/ec6ff0b984c38a77f6d025d8ed0c6524)
Apr 19 18:13:23 <rednaZ>	And "C-h m" shows me "<backtab> indent-for-tab-command (that binding is currently shadowed by another mode)".
Apr 19 18:14:30 <geldmacher>	I got this weird issue, that every separation line in my dashboard ends with '$'. Anyone know what could cause this?
Apr 19 18:14:39 <rednaZ>	I can run "M-x indent-for-tab-command" and it does what I want.
Apr 19 18:14:57 <rednaZ>	But <backtab> still does not.
Apr 19 18:15:57 <lampilelo>	try (define-key haskell-indentation-mode-map (kbd "<backtab>") 'indent-for-tab-command)
Apr 19 18:17:40 <bremner>	you know what would be cool. If M-$ worked in pdfview mode
Apr 19 18:18:23 <bandali>	what's that?
Apr 19 18:18:26 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: does it work?
Apr 19 18:18:29 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: It worked!
Apr 19 18:18:38 <bandali>	ah, ispell-word
Apr 19 18:18:47 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: Thank you very much.
Apr 19 18:19:47 <lampilelo>	rednaZ: did you put it in the hook? or outside?
Apr 19 18:20:33 <lampilelo>	my recommendation for binding it that way would be: http://dpaste.com/13CP2DD.txt

Apr 19 18:21:21 <rednaZ>	My current working init file.
Apr 19 18:21:23 <lampilelo>	that should work too
Apr 19 18:21:29 <rednaZ>	That worked.
Apr 19 18:23:48 <rednaZ>	Thank you again.
Apr 19 18:24:37 <lampilelo>	oh, i made a mistake, if you'd want to use with-eval-after-load you'd use 'haskell-indentation instead of 'haskell-indentation-mode
Apr 19 18:24:42 <lampilelo>	no problem
Apr 19 18:30:00 <rednaZ>	"<lampilelo> because ideally, with global-set-key you'd use a binding that won't have collisions, and modes override global map". But ideally, with my hook I am using a binding that will not have collisions with any other mode. You assumed there would be more colliding modes for you argument: "what if another mode overwrites it too? another hook?" So with that assumption, you can never use global-set-key even if there are no colliding
Apr 19 18:30:01 <rednaZ>	modes yet.
Apr 19 18:33:36 <lampilelo>	C-c X (where X is any letter key) are reserved for the user to set, you could safely bind these kinds of key combinations with global-set-key, also some top-level bindings, like M-o shouldn't be overwritten by anything
Apr 19 18:35:39 <lampilelo>	or you could overwrite with it the default bindings, like C-x k
Apr 19 18:38:25 <lampilelo>	so to be frank, you'd really only create your own minor mode only if you want to overwrite a key combination that is reserved for major modes
Apr 19 18:40:55 <lampilelo>	or if you wanted to be able to enable and disable your bindings at will
Apr 19 18:46:57 <p0a>	Hello how can I have visual-line-mode always be `on' in a certain file?
Apr 19 18:47:08 <p0a>	It's something like *-* but I can't remember what exactly 
Apr 19 18:47:44 <wgreenhouse>	file local variable 
Apr 19 18:48:13 <p0a>	Thank you 
Apr 19 18:58:37 <bepvte>	Im trying to write a "csetq" macro that calls "customize-set-variable" for every two arguments it has. I want "csetq 'thing "value" 'thing3 5" to result in "customize-set-variable 'thing "value"" and "customize-set-variable 'thing3 5". Is there an easy way to write this, or should I use a while loop?
Apr 19 19:00:53 <p0a>	bepvte: Property lists, https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Property-Lists.html#Property-Lists
Apr 19 19:01:08 <lxsameer>	hey folks, how can i get the path to the parent directory of the current working directory ?
Apr 19 19:03:59 <parsnip>	lxsameer: i think there's a section in the info manual, for emacs or elisp, on filenames, etc.
Apr 19 19:03:59 <zooey>	lxsameer: (file-name-directory (directory-file-name (expand-file-name default-directory)))
Apr 19 19:07:14 <lxsameer>	thanks folsk
Apr 19 19:09:48 <p0a>	bepvte: I don't see a way to transverse plists other than a while loop though...
Apr 19 19:11:03 <bepvte>	Ive been looking around, and I think what I need is to use pcase
Apr 19 19:12:44 <p0a>	Why?
Apr 19 19:12:44 <fsbot>	why not?
Apr 19 19:12:53 <p0a>	Maybe but it looks hard 
Apr 19 19:14:06 <bepvte>	pcase doesnt seem too hard, i like it and it makes sense. its just pattern matching in other languages, it plugs in whatever matches the structure into some variables
Apr 19 19:14:43 <ayuce>	maybe something like mapc csetq car/cdr of some list.
Apr 19 19:16:07 <bepvte>	mapc grabs one element at a time though, idk how to make it grab two
Apr 19 19:16:07 <p0a>	I would do something like ``while list length > 1; take car and cadr; repeat''
Apr 19 19:16:32 <p0a>	you can also use the cl-loop macro 
Apr 19 19:16:57 <ayuce>	bepvte: you can use a lambda function do grap anything you like
Apr 19 19:18:40 <ayuce>	s/grap/grab s/do/to
Apr 19 19:19:52 <chris64>	Does anybody know the identifier of the color that Spacemacs is using for it's modeline current project segment?
Apr 19 19:19:52 <bepvte>	hmmm
Apr 19 19:19:52 <wild_buffalo>	in shell mode, is there a way to search the command history?
Apr 19 19:20:05 <wild_buffalo>	ah nvm found it
Apr 19 19:20:05 <chris64>	I'm on deeper-blue theme and it's yellow. Something I would like to change. But in deeper-blue there does not seem to be a color defined that matches it :-|
Apr 19 19:25:06 <rednaZ>	lampilelo: Thanks. Thanks again.
Apr 19 19:31:53 <ayuce>	chris64: i don't use any theme but i would do something like M-x describe-face and search for spacemacs or mode-line. see if this works for you.
Apr 19 19:43:16 <geldmacher>	Guys what am I doing wrong? There are $-signs in my dashboard and I have no clue what causes them: https://i.imgur.com/EkkZMeW.jpg
Apr 19 19:43:42 <geldmacher>	every separation line ends with -----$
Apr 19 19:46:43 <bremner>	,dashboard
Apr 19 19:46:43 <fsbot>	I think dashboard is http://www.nat.org/dashboard/
Apr 19 19:46:57 <bremner>	dead link.
Apr 19 19:49:19 <geldmacher>	ah my bad.. I should mention its of the melpa repository. Ignore my question if you do not support that in here
Apr 19 19:50:24 <chris64>	ayuce: thank you. I've found a spacemacs wrapper function for theming in the meantime, however the powerline colors affected other segments. I'll check describe-face, thanks!
Apr 19 19:55:09 <lampilelo>	geldmacher: melpa is melpa, most people use it
Apr 19 19:55:59 <geldmacher>	i see
Apr 19 19:56:46 <geldmacher>	I guess my dashboard screen width is too big so '$' indicates that the line isn't finished
Apr 19 19:57:04 <ldlework>	Melpa Enables Licentious Packaging Accidents
Apr 19 20:03:16 <lampilelo>	Elpa for life!
Apr 19 20:07:35 <spikemaster>	test
Apr 19 20:18:48 <geldmacher>	alright its the fringe option
Apr 19 20:29:54 <Sacrilegious>	What do you think is an efficient way of working in emacs? (Like configurations, functions and features you use.) I'm a vim user. (I know...) But I'm interested in learning the emacs way(s).
Apr 19 20:31:02 <Sacrilegious>	I have a 40% keyboard with ALT and CTRL easily accessible as thumbkeys, so I guess the default config should work fine.
Apr 19 20:37:49 <geldmacher>	yay setting fringe background and not hiding it did the trick :)
Apr 19 20:37:56 <geldmacher>	no more $-signs

Apr 19 21:34:07 <bremner>	yikes
Apr 19 21:34:49 <bremner>	call me old fashioned, but rsync is a big ball of code to be running as root.
Apr 19 21:34:52 <bremner>	not as bad as emacs, but still
Apr 19 21:36:05 <p0a>	old fashioned
Apr 19 21:36:40 <p0a>	call me old fashioned I think taxes should be configuration files
Apr 19 21:36:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If you don't trust the rsync your package manager provides, you probably shouldn't trust your package manager either.
Apr 19 21:37:43 <bremner>	welp, but that argument sudo chromium here we come
Apr 19 21:37:50 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Chromium is malware and shouldn't be packaged.
Apr 19 21:38:28 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I have a few complains to make to debian now.
Apr 19 21:38:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Fuck.
Apr 19 21:38:31 <p0a>	isnt chromium the thing chrome uses
Apr 19 21:38:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yes.
Apr 19 21:38:34 <p0a>	good luck complaining about google bro
Apr 19 21:39:29 <bremner>	good luck complaining about the only browser that works with jitsi-meet
Apr 19 21:39:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	While it isn't as chockfull of spyware as Chrome proper, it's definitely not ungoogled chromium
Apr 19 21:40:27 <p0a>	Am I wrong that jitsi/zoom are basically a souped up netcat
Apr 19 21:40:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yes.
Apr 19 21:40:43 <bremner>	you're wrong
Apr 19 21:40:55 <p0a>	I mean netcat is better
Apr 19 21:41:10 <bremner>	yeah, well, tell that to people who need to get work done.
Apr 19 21:41:29 <bremner>	so much priveledge.
Apr 19 21:41:36 <p0a>	okay relax, wait jitsi is actually opensource?
Apr 19 21:41:43 *	p0a questions why anyone went with zoom then
Apr 19 21:41:59 <drawkula>	opensource never spies?
Apr 19 21:42:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	drawkula: It does, it's just provable if it doesn't.
Apr 19 21:42:50 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Closed Source = default nope. Open Source = vetting required.
Apr 19 21:42:50 <wrycode>	I just compiled emacs using the lucid toolkit for the first time, surprised at the performance gain. I'm on Wayland (using the sway compositor), I wonder if the various lags (that are now gone) were related to xwayland or just pure gtk?
Apr 19 21:43:23 <p0a>	wrycode: any particular function that lagged?
Apr 19 21:43:49 <drawkula>	Aurora_v_kosmose: it does not help if sensible info dripples to unwanted listeners if you later can find why
Apr 19 21:44:10 <drawkula>	but ppl would work over FB if mr.z would offer that
Apr 19 21:44:25 <wrycode>	new emacsclient frames open faster (and without an apparent one-time redisplay flickering), that's the most noticeable thing
Apr 19 21:44:25 <drawkula>	maybe they just beg to ge punished
Apr 19 21:44:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	drawkula: Indeed. Vetting is supposed to be done prior to using it.
Apr 19 21:44:54 <wrycode>	but scrolling in mu4e or org agenda seems less skippy now too (I have a high keyboard refresh rate)
Apr 19 21:44:58 <drawkula>	at least build your own vpns
Apr 19 21:44:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Y'know, like the reason why a lot of people are waiting for WireGuard to actually be audited.
Apr 19 21:45:13 <p0a>	What's wrong with AES128? C'mon
Apr 19 21:45:37 <drawkula>	and dont let ppl use their family PCs for remote work
Apr 19 21:45:55 <p0a>	wrycode: compare package options to your configuration?
Apr 19 21:45:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm not a cryptographer, but I'd go higher since I know 256 in a suite is stronger.
Apr 19 21:46:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Are there better suites than AES? Probably.
Apr 19 21:46:41 <wrycode>	p0a I don't understand your message, sorry
Apr 19 21:46:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Also ECDSA uses magical numbers with no explanations. Do not want.
Apr 19 21:47:35 <p0a>	wrycode: I am assuming you got the laggy emacs from your distribution right?
Apr 19 21:47:35 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	drawkula: My workplaces lend laptops to devs.
Apr 19 21:48:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Considering they mandate the use of proprietary software, I'm rather happy to not put it on my personal hardware.
Apr 19 21:48:04 <drawkula>	my sister does remote work with her private PC and youd be schocked if you knew her position
Apr 19 21:48:19 <drawkula>	so i assume lots of sich shit is done right now
Apr 19 21:48:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm a strong believer in hardware isolation as a security practice.
Apr 19 21:48:49 <p0a>	You're not alone
Apr 19 21:49:05 <drawkula>	I see the opposite these days... in sensible businesses
Apr 19 21:49:09 <ecbrown>	docker! devop!
Apr 19 21:49:28 <shukryzablah>	is there an emacs mode to get a job 
Apr 19 21:49:47 <p0a>	M-x doctor
Apr 19 21:50:10 <shukryzablah>	p0a: ah you know my dr too! a lot of ppl do
Apr 19 21:50:31 <drawkula>	mine has starved
Apr 19 21:51:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	drawkula: You see them advocating for mixing safe and unsafe domains? Or just disregarding sane security practices in general?
Apr 19 21:51:48 <drawkula>	there is greater and lesser evil
Apr 19 21:52:18 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: what's your opinion on Zoom?
Apr 19 21:52:53 <wrycode>	p0a: ah, I had the lags in both the standard emacs package on arch and the emacs-git AUR package. The emacs-lucid-git AUR package seems faster. It's possible it omits some extra feature or something. But I'm thinking there's a performance implication to using xwayland I didn't know about
Apr 19 21:53:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Docker without SELinux is asking for problems.
Apr 19 21:53:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	,selinux
Apr 19 21:53:20 <fsbot>	From memory, selinux is [0] Security-Enhanced Linux, a Linux kernel security module that provides the mechanism for supporting access control security policies. http://selinuxproject.org
Apr 19 21:53:20 <fsbot>	[1] supported in GNU Emacs since 24.1 https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.24.1
Apr 19 21:53:20 <fsbot>	[2] http://stopdisablingselinux.com/
Apr 19 21:53:33 *	Aurora_v_kosmose praises [2]
Apr 19 21:54:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Not a fan. It's still running arbitrary proprietary code in your browser or on your phone. Though if you have a device dedicated for unsafe-use, I suppose it's okay.
Apr 19 21:55:10 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: not a fan is an understatement
Apr 19 21:55:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	VMs may be an acceptable substitute, provided proper security practices (no hyperthreading) & isolation (MAC).
Apr 19 21:55:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Heh, I suppose so.
Apr 19 21:55:48 <p0a>	That selinux link was nice, it had a youtube video for selinux
Apr 19 21:55:54 <p0a>	where did you learn your security stuff?
Apr 19 21:56:10 <p0a>	I wanted to learn some more security stuff for linux but I'm a big dummy 
Apr 19 21:56:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Good question. A small part of it was work training, but for the most part lurking on imageboards and reading on the actual projects' sites & wikis.
Apr 19 21:56:55 <sam_c>	Doing it, for the most part
Apr 19 21:57:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	When a VM engine has a "security" section, you don't skip it. You read it and try to understand the pros & cons.
Apr 19 21:57:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So basically yes, sam_c's tl;dr
Apr 19 21:57:59 <p0a>	There's too many concepts I'm unaware of 
Apr 19 21:57:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Unknown unknowns are a bitch.
Apr 19 21:58:39 <p0a>	also deep down I'm a bit unconvinced by linux approach of users/groups for security
Apr 19 21:58:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Keeping an eye on infosec news sites is a good idea.
Apr 19 21:59:12 <wasamasa>	but what if you don't understand what they say
Apr 19 21:59:20 <sam_c>	look up the terms :)
Apr 19 21:59:44 <wasamasa>	lol, that's not a replacement for understanding
Apr 19 21:59:49 <sam_c>	no, but it's how you start. How can you understand it if you don't even know the vocabulary? 
Apr 19 21:59:56 <wasamasa>	yeah, ECDSA means elliptic curve DSA and DSA means digital signature algorithm
Apr 19 22:00:01 <wasamasa>	but you still don't know whether it's any good/bad and why
Apr 19 22:00:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: It's a good approach as a start or additional layer, though more fine-grained control is necessary for some use-cases. Like safely running VMs under a non-root user. Without Apparmor/SELinux, any VM getting pwn'd & finding a sandbox escape gets the VM process' rights. It could then rekt all the other VMs running under that same user.
Apr 19 22:00:11 <sam_c>	If something talks about "buffer overflows" causally, you can look up a buffer if you don't get it, and then further lookup what a buffer overflow is in general and some introductory resources
Apr 19 22:00:27 <sam_c>	I'm not being flippant, I was being serious
Apr 19 22:00:35 <sam_c>	I didn't just mean expand acronyms
Apr 19 22:01:01 <wasamasa>	what then, reading the first paragraph on wikipedia?
Apr 19 22:01:18 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I see, so the tuning comes from kernel modules
Apr 19 22:01:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	qemu has sVirt, which attaches categories to every VM process & its resources automatically, so they can only read/write things they should have access to.
Apr 19 22:01:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(sVirt autoconfigures Apparmor/SELinux)
Apr 19 22:01:50 <sam_c>	There are a lot of introductory texts and blog posts and all the rest on $TOPIC. I just mean that if you read some news and you don't get what the context is, start by researching the concepts. Just like any other thing you don't know. Security isn't different
Apr 19 22:02:02 <wasamasa>	the stakes are higher though
Apr 19 22:02:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah, categories are a SELinux specific thing (MCS), apparmor uses different configs.
Apr 19 22:02:18 <sam_c>	I'm not suggesting that based on a rudimentary google they start claiming to develop secure software, just that it is a good place to begin
Apr 19 22:02:34 <wasamasa>	you can banter about your favorite programming languages and the worst damage it will do is ruining someone's social skills
Apr 19 22:03:05 <sam_c>	you're right, it is better to just tell people not to bother trying
Apr 19 22:03:13 <p0a>	my first thing to try would be to learn some more about linux. I wanted to install gentoo for some time
Apr 19 22:03:30 <p0a>	I will do it when I have some time, and take notes on things so that I can re-read stuff even if I forget
Apr 19 22:03:39 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Looking up stuff like "intro to infosec" "computer security intro" & such helps. "awesome <topic>" tneds to bring up currated github lists of resources on <topic>.
Apr 19 22:03:39 <sam_c>	you are right it's important. I'm just saying security doesn't need to be scary to a newbie. :)
Apr 19 22:03:39 <p0a>	I'd also like to learn some networking but AFAIK it's a huge topic
Apr 19 22:03:56 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yep.
Apr 19 22:03:56 <wasamasa>	"Emacs is not worth securing because it doesn't do sandboxes" is a hugely misleading proposition
Apr 19 22:03:56 <p0a>	I mean just understanding TCP is crazy
Apr 19 22:04:18 *	sam_c didn't say that
Apr 19 22:04:18 <wasamasa>	not you
Apr 19 22:04:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Any improvement to security which doesn't compromise security is worth doing on its own.
Apr 19 22:04:23 <wasamasa>	it's a recurring topic in here
Apr 19 22:04:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	*compromise functionality
Apr 19 22:04:29 <sam_c>	wasamasa: moronic then
Apr 19 22:04:46 <sam_c>	what a silly thing to think
Apr 19 22:04:46 <wasamasa>	almost as moronic as "Guile Emacs will save us"
Apr 19 22:05:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If it compromises functionality, consider the cost of not securing it vs doing so, or find a third option that allows you to have your security & a reimplementation of the feature.
Apr 19 22:05:09 <bremner>	rudybot: guile emacs cures coronavirus
Apr 19 22:05:09 <rudybot>	bremner: we've had people here taking homeopathic "cures" for malaria instead of proper antimalarials 
Apr 19 22:05:09 <wasamasa>	or "Rewriting Emacs in my favorite programming language will save us"
Apr 19 22:05:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Guile Emacs doesn't seem to promise much other than performance increases & closer-to-seamless FFI.
Apr 19 22:05:50 <sam_c>	p0a: you don't have to learn everything at once. just start somewhere :)
Apr 19 22:06:08 <p0a>	sam_c: yeah thank you. I will start with learning some more about linux
Apr 19 22:06:17 <p0a>	Been a user for many years but still a noob
Apr 19 22:06:17 <sam_c>	p0a: I'm becoming a gentoo developer so I'd probably recommend it anyway but I think it's useful to learn about the bits that fit together.
Apr 19 22:06:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Worth considering are system administration introductions. Particularly the parts about securing systems.
Apr 19 22:06:19 <bremner>	hmm. Did a search for racketmacs and all the top matches are on pornhub
Apr 19 22:06:25 <sam_c>	p0a: also most of the stuff you hear are myths
Apr 19 22:06:28 <bremner>	what are you trying to tell me google?
Apr 19 22:06:46 <sam_c>	yes, Aurora_v_kosmose is obviously right
Apr 19 22:06:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: But learning how your system works in the first place helps you understand what can break and what it could do to your security.
Apr 19 22:07:00 <sam_c>	sysadmin guides are great
Apr 19 22:07:00 <wasamasa>	the problem I see with the sandboxing standpoint is that it's one way to think about a platform running software from people you don't trust at all and I very much prefer the standpoint of engineering software you trust properly
Apr 19 22:07:51 <bremner>	so, don't use melpa?
Apr 19 22:07:51 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: ah nice, thank you
Apr 19 22:07:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wasamasa: The issue is that prevents anything but on-premise server hosting.
Apr 19 22:08:27 <wasamasa>	I'm still talking about emacs, lol
Apr 19 22:08:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah, oops.
Apr 19 22:08:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Generally, when you have a vague idea how the parts of a system fit together, you can get a general idea of what would happen if one of them were to suddenly break.
Apr 19 22:09:42 <p0a>	What about grsecurity? What's that?
Apr 19 22:09:51 <wasamasa>	it's kind of like adding improvements on top of a base known to be good vs adding impairments on top of a system known to be bad
Apr 19 22:09:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: A dead project.
Apr 19 22:09:51 <sam_c>	p0a: don't remind me! :(
Apr 19 22:09:51 <p0a>	:( Okay
Apr 19 22:09:57 <wasamasa>	you can get somewhere with the former and maybe even be done at some point
Apr 19 22:10:06 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It used to be a bunch of nice security improvement patches for the Linux kernel which decided to go proprietary.
Apr 19 22:10:20 <sam_c>	Not dead, just expensive now. It was a hardening project (PaX) for the kernel and some other bits for Linux but it's now like $10k/licence just for companies. They went closed source.
Apr 19 22:10:33 <wasamasa>	the latter is endless churn because of the sheer complexity and interactions between every component
Apr 19 22:10:45 <wasamasa>	browsers went for it and I don't want emacs to go for it
Apr 19 22:10:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	sam_c: It's no longer readable, hence it's dead.
Apr 19 22:10:58 <sam_c>	I just mean it still exists
Apr 19 22:11:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Fair.
Apr 19 22:11:21 <p0a>	like a black hole does
Apr 19 22:11:34 <sam_c>	i would probably call it dead too but there are some devs on gentoo who have access to it through work so we still see some mention of it
Apr 19 22:11:42 <wasamasa>	grsec's fate is kind of funny considering this security industry is big on being secretive and making their money by scaring the shit out of you
Apr 19 22:11:56 <sam_c>	which they criticised for years... :)
Apr 19 22:12:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Don't confuse security industry vs security theater performance troupes.
Apr 19 22:12:17 <wasamasa>	they all have to get their money somehow
Apr 19 22:12:17 <p0a>	I play the banjo
Apr 19 22:12:20 <wasamasa>	some are more obvious about it than others
Apr 19 22:12:30 <bepvte>	https://pastebin.com/NEqK1MV2 my macro is finished
Apr 19 22:12:44 <wgreenhouse>	wrycode: lucid emacs is indeed nice, and as a free bonus your emacs will be less susceptible to x11-related crashes
Apr 19 22:13:10 <wasamasa>	sometimes I feel like writing "Dear customer, sorry for scaring the shit out of you. Here's some clarification on the points you mentioned..."
Apr 19 22:13:25 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Mind, the securing a bad base part, it's not quite that straigthforward. Having an explicitly known backdoor inserted by management doesn't necessarily means some script kiddy scanning your servers with a vulnerability scanner will be able to break in.
Apr 19 22:13:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	You're still pwn'd though. But not all attackers have the same capacity for damage.
Apr 19 22:14:02 <wrycode>	wgreenhouse yes! 
Apr 19 22:14:49 <p0a>	bepvte: that trickery with '(progn) is really weird
Apr 19 22:14:49 <wasamasa>	that's the secretive part
Apr 19 22:14:58 <p0a>	bepvte: you shouldn't be doing stuff like that
Apr 19 22:14:58 <wasamasa>	depending on how much money to pay, you can lift the veil to some degree
Apr 19 22:15:07 <bepvte>	how else do i return multiple expressions from one macro
Apr 19 22:15:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Ah right, OWASP is probably known keeping an eye on for some some security practice recommendations.
Apr 19 22:15:15 <wasamasa>	sometimes people fuck up and you get new insights in that black market
Apr 19 22:16:01 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: nice, thanks
Apr 19 22:16:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Getting_Started
Apr 19 22:17:07 <bepvte>	changed it to (cons progn res) is that better
Apr 19 22:18:22 <p0a>	bepvte: you can use `, 
Apr 19 22:18:22 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: It's unfortunately a very broad topic, and one that consistantly changes as the systems involved do.
Apr 19 22:18:49 <p0a>	bepvte: `(progn ,res)
Apr 19 22:19:04 <wasamasa>	web stuff is a special kind of clusterfuck
Apr 19 22:19:12 <bepvte>	aight 
Apr 19 22:19:34 <wasamasa>	sure, network fails and operating system esoterica are weird, too
Apr 19 22:19:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: https://sec.eff.org/ A lot of this is way too newbie-intro even for you, but the threat-model intro is still a valuable thing.
Apr 19 22:20:09 <wasamasa>	but web stuff is uniquely bad in its quest to increase the overall complexity over and over again, with no stop in sight
Apr 19 22:20:21 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: nice links, thank you 
Apr 19 22:20:40 <p0a>	wasamasa: I think it started with the browser wars right
Apr 19 22:21:02 <p0a>	people stacking shit to stand higher
Apr 19 22:21:13 <wasamasa>	it started with supporting JS
Apr 19 22:21:13 <p0a>	and now we've got mountains of manure
Apr 19 22:21:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: Threat Models essentially stand at the root of how you decide the tradeoffs you're willing to do for security.
Apr 19 22:21:47 <wasamasa>	going through old stuff on server-side security is fun because it's short treatises
Apr 19 22:24:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	p0a: An interesting note regarding organisational security. The overwhelming majority of hacks and leaks start with phishing.
Apr 19 22:25:10 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah, cheap
Apr 19 22:25:21 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: is there a bit of selection bias there tho?
Apr 19 22:25:27 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: not everyone is doing stuxnet
Apr 19 22:25:27 <technomancy>	those are the ones you hear about
Apr 19 22:25:54 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Of course, it'd be embarassing to reveal your company just can't into secure programming & just fucked up.
Apr 19 22:26:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	</s>
Apr 19 22:26:09 <technomancy>	hehe
Apr 19 22:26:25 <wasamasa>	yeah, you don't hear about every single time someone clicked on a dodgy search engine result to download a windows dll
Apr 19 22:26:28 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But sarcasm aside, yes, a lot of companies are irresponsible and don't disclose compromises.
Apr 19 22:26:28 <technomancy>	my personal favorite is "we forgot to change the S3 bucket settings to private"
Apr 19 22:26:48 <p0a>	"forgot"
Apr 19 22:26:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And if your own systems are pwn'd, someone who isn't dumb will generally take pains to avoid being noticed, rather than making it obvious. 
Apr 19 22:27:12 <p0a>	those open databases have to have been sold under the table
Apr 19 22:27:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So you may never know that you were pwn'd.
Apr 19 22:28:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	There isn't really a limit to the paranoia rabbit hole but how deep you're willing to go. It's generally not helpful to head for the bottom. 
Apr 19 22:29:09 <hodapp>	at a certain point you are reduced to using "IF ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, THEN ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN!!!!!111" as your only attack vector
Apr 19 22:29:30 <sam_c>	^
Apr 19 22:29:31 <hodapp>	"What if I have BRAIN parasites that are transmitting my thoughts?"
Apr 19 22:30:02 <p0a>	tinfoil mask: corona + brain waves in 1
Apr 19 22:30:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	At some point, you have to give up and act on what you can act.
Apr 19 22:30:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(That sounded better phrased in my head)
Apr 19 22:31:42 <technomancy>	it's true that you have to learn how to operate with the understanding that you'll never know exactly how bad it is =)
Apr 19 22:31:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	i.e.: Could the government pwn your things with some 0-day or spy on you with TEMPEST equipment? Sure. But why do that when you can just be SWAT'd instead?
Apr 19 22:32:20 <p0a>	but why do that when they can just poison your water right?
Apr 19 22:32:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Eh, degrees and layers.
Apr 19 22:32:44 <p0a>	and paranoia->rationalization->paranoization
Apr 19 22:32:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But I mentioned that paranoia case because it comes up often on imageboards.
Apr 19 22:33:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	"Every thread" often.
Apr 19 22:34:37 <p0a>	,paranoia
Apr 19 22:34:38 <fsbot>	Remember, just because you're crazy doesn't mean they aren't trying to get you.
Apr 19 22:34:44 <p0a>	lol
Apr 19 22:35:56 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	A fun factoid regarding tempest. HDMI is generally not encrypted, and it's a binary protocol. A good receiver could relatively-easily reconstruct the output.
Apr 19 22:36:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	In what cases is it encrypted? Not security-improvement ones. DRM ones. For some stupid reason.
Apr 19 22:37:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	4k HD monitors include public-key cryptography for the purpose of DRM. It's ludicrous.
Apr 19 22:38:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Which in a lot of cases got broken anyway because those keys were static.
Apr 19 22:38:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	:p
Apr 19 22:42:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Side-note, I despise the practice of sending PDFs by email when plaintext would've done the job just as well.
Apr 19 22:42:28 <p0a>	how about docx
Apr 19 22:43:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Similarly, both can possibly contain arbitrary code. Most docx-opening programs are also capable of running said code.
Apr 19 22:43:25 <p0a>	yeah I agree, which is why I said I thought tax forms should be configuration files
Apr 19 22:43:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	PDF code will either attack the decoder or depend on Adobe's JS extensions (which not all PDF readers implement)
Apr 19 22:44:18 <p0a>	lol static keys 
Apr 19 22:44:21 <p0a>	I just read what you wrote about DRM 
Apr 19 22:44:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Unchanging keys when people have access to the hardware is a foregone conclusion.
Apr 19 22:45:23 <p0a>	I'll sue you!
Apr 19 22:45:29 <p0a>	sue the internet!
Apr 19 22:46:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	A number of countries don't recognize laws which forbid reverse-engineering. Either partly or wholesale.
Apr 19 22:47:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	This is, in my opinion, a stance more should adopt.
Apr 19 22:47:54 <p0a>	Aurora_v_kosmose: we live in a world where you can't get a high res picture of mona lisa
Apr 19 22:48:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That's entirely silly. Even if it had been copyrighted, it should be expired since a few centuries.
Apr 19 22:48:48 <cluck>	well.. you can, you just can't get caught with it
Apr 19 22:49:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	We need someone with a glass eye and time to waste. Also for pandemic to end.
Apr 19 22:49:55 <p0a>	btw I was joking about Mona Lisa she's actually on wikipedia. When I tried to insert a quote in my thesis however
Apr 19 22:50:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh?
Apr 19 22:50:22 <p0a>	I was quite concerned. It is incredibly complicated to know that you are not infringing copyright 
Apr 19 22:50:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Thanks Disney (go die in a fire plz)
Apr 19 22:50:51 <p0a>	The cop out is to pay some gatekeeper to tell you who has the copyright and subsequently ask that entity for permission 
Apr 19 22:50:58 <cluck>	rudybot: clay sculptor arrested for selling pot
Apr 19 22:51:01 <rudybot>	cluck: I prefer mud sculptor
Apr 19 22:51:22 <p0a>	rudybot likes the good stuff
Apr 19 22:52:06 <cluck>	fsbot: ganja??
Apr 19 22:52:06 <fsbot>	Improbable!
Apr 19 22:54:36 <wgreenhouse>	imageboards are indeed a good place to find security obsessives, but most either don't have a threat model or have one that is totally unreasonable to their situation and thus self defeating 
Apr 19 22:55:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Paranoia runs rampant.
Apr 19 22:55:32 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The resources can be good, the threat models are generally not helpful.
Apr 19 22:58:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Of course some of them live in regimes where comparatively mundane things have horrible consequences. *Thinks of how Japan has prison for possession of something so pedestrian as weed*
Apr 19 23:00:11 <wgreenhouse>	classic *chan threat model: the US intelligence community throwing the level of resources they'd commit to a major operation against another state, including things like custom implants in hardware on the way to the purchaser
Apr 19 23:01:02 <p0a>	Japan? Most of the world has prison for weed
Apr 19 23:01:07 <p0a>	and weed is not pedestrian
Apr 19 23:01:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's very much so.
Apr 19 23:01:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Alcohol is a much harder drug and hilariously, legal in most places.
Apr 19 23:01:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I can literally buy enough to kill myself in one evening here and no one will bat an eyelid.
Apr 19 23:01:55 <p0a>	But that's not relevant
Apr 19 23:02:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But it is. The pedestrianity of a drug or not should be how hard it is to make and how dangerous it is.
Apr 19 23:02:38 <p0a>	Think of the opium wars
Apr 19 23:02:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Alcohol scores a 1~2 on difficulty to make at most.
Apr 19 23:03:26 <p0a>	Idk about should, look at the world today
Apr 19 23:03:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That would imply it's alright to have moronic state leaders.
Apr 19 23:04:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But I digress.

Apr 19 23:20:36 <white_magic>	anyone know why emacs might register key presses incorrectly? "C-9" is registered by 'describe-key' as just '9'. 'C-8' is registered as 'DEL'!
Apr 19 23:20:59 <white_magic>	I typically use emacs in WSL in Windows and I don't have any such problem. But now I'm running Ubuntu natively.
Apr 19 23:21:34 <cluck>	wgreenhouse: _some_ paranoids aren't wrong even though they're completely insane. even nobodies can find themselves unknowingly in strategic locations on someone else's opsec
Apr 19 23:23:55 <cluck>	wgreenhouse: ie:. family/friends of activists acting in secret might unknowingly have access to priviledged data and thus become a fat juicy target
Apr 19 23:30:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Or accidentally being flagged as an activist for being in their phone GPS location too often... because you go to the same coffee shop before work.
Apr 19 23:33:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Practical example: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2020/03/10/google-data-puts-innocent-man-at-the-scene-of-a-crime/
Apr 19 23:34:32 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's sort of silly because it seems obvious to me that you don't bring a mobile when robbing a place.

Apr 19 23:40:03 <neuro_sys>	No comm with your fellow burglar?
Apr 19 23:40:27 <neuro_sys>	Joking aside, that news article is concerning.

Apr 20 00:16:50 <wrycode>	Anyone have a personal solution for saving compile commands for various projects (that don't use make)? I know it breaks reproducibility but it'd be nice for Emacs to just save the one-liners I use to build each project without me thinking about it
Apr 20 00:17:19 <wrycode>	projectile-compile-project doesn't do it apparently 
Apr 20 00:19:59 <cluck>	Aurora_v_kosmose: that's what we get when their job isn't to catch the culprit but instead to meet the monthly quota of tickets and fall guys
Apr 20 00:26:43 <wgreenhouse>	Conveniently not reading the part of the article where the person filed a motion to get rid of the warrant for the geolocation data, and the prosecutor voluntarily withdrew it. :)
Apr 20 00:29:11 <bremner>	fair enough. Although just being accused can mess up people's lives pretty badly
Apr 20 00:33:43 <wgreenhouse>	Of course-- but treating these as normal forensic tools (subject to error, and also to open dispute in court, not national security oracles) is progress
Apr 20 00:34:46 <bremner>	at least it's not graphology :P
Apr 20 00:35:00 <bremner>	or phrenology 
Apr 20 00:35:18 <wgreenhouse>	or polygraphy
Apr 20 00:35:28 <bremner>	or porn.. err. nvm
Apr 20 00:35:37 <wgreenhouse>	,sting
Apr 20 00:35:39 <fsbot>	*badum TISH*
Apr 20 00:36:58 <wgreenhouse>	wrycode: file-local values of ,,dv compile-command,, may work well enough
Apr 20 00:36:59 <fsbot>	Last shell command used to do a compilation; default for next compilation.
Apr 20 00:36:59 <fsbot>	Sometimes it is useful for files to supply local values for this variable.
Apr 20 00:36:59 <fsbot>	You might also use mode hooks to specify it in certain modes, like this:
Apr 20 00:36:59 <fsbot>	    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 20 00:46:32 <cluck>	wgreenhouse: you're assuming the prosecutor will never misbehave with their newly granted powers, aaron wasn't so lucky
Apr 20 00:48:42 <wgreenhouse>	cluck: newly granted?
Apr 20 00:49:11 <wgreenhouse>	Also aaron was guilty of the charged offense. The fact that it shouldn't be a crime is more Congress's problem
Apr 20 00:51:26 <wgreenhouse>	Also I'm not assuming anything of the kind, but the article illustrates how we *want* the use of geolocation data in criminal cases to be handled, IMO--i.e. you're given notice of where it came from and can dispute it in court
Apr 20 00:52:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The things is that in non-sane countries, getting a lawyer and getting rid of the charges is ruinously expensive.
Apr 20 00:52:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	As evidence, even he needed to borrow.
Apr 20 00:52:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If you're poor, you're fucked.
Apr 20 00:52:36 <dzho>	aaron was never convicted of course so to say he was guilty is to assert something never proven.
Apr 20 00:53:04 <wgreenhouse>	dzho: he confessed--he asserted a very tenuous necessity defense 
Apr 20 00:53:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Context?
Apr 20 00:54:28 <wgreenhouse>	"the public needed the info in those JSTOR articles, so I had the right to breach MIT's network to get them," basica;ly
Apr 20 00:54:42 <dzho>	he didn't breach anything
Apr 20 00:55:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm rather in favor of unpaywall & scihub
Apr 20 00:56:27 <wgreenhouse>	dzho: he fraudulently obtained MIT credentials for a machine he then hid in a wall
Apr 20 00:56:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah that sounds vaguely familiar.
Apr 20 00:57:09 <wgreenhouse>	If he believed so strongly in the necessity and justification of his act, he could've done it in his own name
Apr 20 00:57:33 <dzho>	where are you getting this about fraudulent credentials?
Apr 20 00:57:42 <wgreenhouse>	guest account in the name of "Gary Host," as in "ghost"
Apr 20 00:58:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Generally, doing things in your own name is a good way to go to sleep one day and never wake up.
Apr 20 00:58:28 <technomancy>	"justification" there is a bit of a weasel word IMO
Apr 20 00:58:49 <technomancy>	his actions were justified in that they were morally correct, but not justified in the sense of "the justice system would ever accept they were correct"
Apr 20 00:58:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Self-d0x1ng isn't courage, it's foolhardiness & hubris.

Apr 20 01:14:59 <technomancy>	grym: well, it's a lot easier to get people on your side when your cause is "hey how about we avoid destroying literally everything you love?"
Apr 20 01:15:17 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: no they aren't.   at worst, they're a really effective tiger team 
Apr 20 01:15:19 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: open civil disobedience doesn't require assuming your target is decent, only that they're vulnerable to public opinion
Apr 20 01:15:33 <bpalmer>	Aurora_v_kosmose: yes, a pretty big difference. 
Apr 20 01:15:36 <grym>	wgreenhouse: or that you're willing to take the hit anyway because you can't not 
Apr 20 01:15:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	bpalmer: Yes, one of them is suicidal the other is malicious.
Apr 20 01:16:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm. Not necessarily suicidal. Self-destructive at a minimum though.
Apr 20 01:16:43 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: i went to an interesting lecture by elie wiesel about that once
Apr 20 01:17:07 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: in some situations being known is a good defense to being disappeared or smeared
Apr 20 01:17:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Yeah. It's a weird balance. Sometimes being widely known is a protection of its own.
Apr 20 01:17:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's taking a chance though.
Apr 20 01:17:52 <grym>	to a point, but the list of martyrs is long and storied
Apr 20 01:18:21 <grym>	(which was weisel's point; the difference to him between a martyr and a suicide was intent, not outcome)
Apr 20 01:19:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The problem with martyr is that it prevents you from doing any further work. Or enjoying the fruit of your own work.
Apr 20 01:19:08 <bpalmer>	And there's a huge  difference between either martyrdom or suicide, and murder. 
Apr 20 01:19:30 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: it's nothing you should seek out 
Apr 20 01:20:26 <grym>	riffing on george carlin, "if you say to yourself 'i wanna go down to 42nd street and commit a mortal sin, save yourself the train fare man, you did it!"
Apr 20 01:23:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	bpalmer: There's such a difference in intent, but not outcome.
Apr 20 01:23:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Both matter though.
Apr 20 01:26:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	grym: Ending up a martyr despite yourself would be a sign of carelessness or bad luck then.
Apr 20 01:28:42 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: no, it's a question of priorities
Apr 20 01:29:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I can see how that would work.
Apr 20 01:29:10 <winny>	is there a way to do multiline isearch regexp?
Apr 20 01:29:30 <winny>	I see there is a way to explicitally match a newline, but i really don't care where the newline occurs, just want to treat newline the same as any other whitespace
Apr 20 01:29:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	winny: c-q c-j quotes a newline.
Apr 20 01:30:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah... nvm, it doesn't seem to work in this case.
Apr 20 01:30:51 <winny>	i could do a (.|<quoted newline>)* everywhere I need to match anything
Apr 20 01:31:02 <winny>	hmm, that might just work, though not ideal =)
Apr 20 01:31:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm. Works intermitently on my end.
Apr 20 01:31:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Well, best of luck at any rate.
Apr 20 01:35:50 <winny>	cheers
Apr 20 01:36:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Worked? Nice.
Apr 20 01:57:49 <bpalmer>	Let's prepare for a night at the opera

Apr 20 08:35:08 <twb>	codingquark: you are a gateway influence
Apr 20 08:35:48 <codingquark>	twb: not very useful because it is an emacs related link
Apr 20 08:45:06 <nomad_fr>	hi
Apr 20 08:46:15 <twb>	nomad_fr: hi, do you have an Emacs question?
Apr 20 08:46:48 <nomad_fr>	twb: yes, I'd like to sort my mail by date without threading in mu4e
Apr 20 08:48:06 <twb>	I dunno about mu4e
Apr 20 08:48:13 <twb>	have you tried M-x customize-group RET mu4e
Apr 20 08:48:18 <twb>	and C-h m
Apr 20 08:53:36 <kensanata>	https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/Sorting-and-threading.html
Apr 20 08:53:55 <kensanata>	mu4e-headers-show-threads sounds like the one?
Apr 20 08:54:28 <nomad_fr>	kensanata: will have a look at that, in fact I want to be able to disable threading then enable it again
Apr 20 08:56:54 <kensanata>	I'd probably start by doing M-x mu4e SPACE thread and see what completions show up. Perhaps you need to enable ivy-mode do have that expand into all the possible commands, I don't know.
Apr 20 09:05:10 <nomad_fr>	kensanata: in afct I just have to push 'P' ... ;-) thanks for your link 
Apr 20 09:06:12 <bpalmer>	Hmm, the US's postal service may go bankrupt by the fall. 
Apr 20 09:06:34 <bpalmer>	seems like there's a call to arms going around to buy stamps and send physical mail
Apr 20 09:06:34 <twb>	bpalmer: you mean it was turning a profit before?
Apr 20 09:06:40 <twb>	bpalmer: that's DEEPLY bad
Apr 20 09:07:02 <twb>	bpalmer: postal systems are supposed to operate at a loss because they generate positive externalities
Apr 20 09:07:31 <bpalmer>	twb: since the 2000s, I think, it's been directed both to run a profit and to fully pay for pensions 30 years in the future (unlike any private pension).
Apr 20 09:07:32 <twb>	bpalmer: the same as road builders or metros or swimming pools
Apr 20 09:07:48 <bpalmer>	and forbidden from closing unprofitable stations.
Apr 20 09:07:53 <twb>	bpalmer: I know Auspost (our equivalent) has gone bankrupt 3 times since 2000
Apr 20 09:08:05 <twb>	bpalmer: each time basically cheating by having e.g. a retail store chain
Apr 20 09:08:17 <twb>	and using that to offset the losses of the actual important bit
Apr 20 09:08:32 <bpalmer>	There is a widespread belief that this is aimed at making it go bankrupt so that then it can be privatized somehow.
Apr 20 09:08:48 <twb>	bpalmer: of course -- asset stripping
Apr 20 09:09:12 <twb>	Also they tripled the postage a few years ago, and sent a thing out saying basically "99% of post is banks and corporate and spam, so what the fuck do you care?"
Apr 20 09:09:32 <twb>	Also I think they gave pensioners 100 free stamps a year for life
Apr 20 09:09:47 <twb>	since pensioners are the only _voters_ who might give a shit
Apr 20 09:09:52 <bpalmer>	ah, the US raised postage rates a long while back but made a stamp valid for life.
Apr 20 09:10:40 <bpalmer>	so if you bought $50/worth of stamps in 2008 (say that was 100 stamps at the time), you'll be able to send 100 first class letters.
Apr 20 09:12:49 <twb>	bpalmer: I think here stamps have face value in cents
Apr 20 09:13:03 <twb>	bpalmer: so if you buy a 30c stamp today, it's worth 30c of 2050 money in 2050
Apr 20 09:13:10 <twb>	bpalmer: i.e. inflation happens
Apr 20 09:13:45 <twb>	bpalmer: did you know when post was cool, there were as many as 9 separate deliveries per day
Apr 20 09:14:09 <bpalmer>	I did not know that.
Apr 20 09:14:18 <twb>	bpalmer: and there was this one guy who single-handedly convinced the government to change things from cash-on-delivery to the modern stamp system
Apr 20 09:14:23 <bpalmer>	I do know that in the 19th century, upper class British folks could do multiple exchanges in a day
Apr 20 09:14:35 <twb>	bpalmer: you used to have to pay to receive a letter, but you could refuse and not open it
Apr 20 09:14:46 <twb>	bpalmer: so people worked out you could encode short messages in the recipient name
Apr 20 09:15:06 <twb>	bpalmer: like "To: Alice 'Mum's Dead' Smith"
Apr 20 09:15:29 <twb>	And back then (before stamps) it was like $20 to receive a message, instead of $1 to send one
Apr 20 09:15:45 <twb>	So only super rich people routinely sent post
Apr 20 09:22:50 <bpalmer>	rudybot: imagine a world in which you can send mail to anybody you want.
Apr 20 09:23:13 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I find it hard to imagine that anybody really believes that stuff
Apr 20 09:24:30 <bpalmer>	rudybot: you're right. You need to choose the right color envelope and have the proper return address if you want people to open it.
Apr 20 09:24:52 <rudybot>	bpalmer: just send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the address on your screen
Apr 20 09:32:05 <twb>	Let's each send a copy of Ulysses to bpalmer's work address every day for a year
Apr 20 09:32:45 <bpalmer>	the route each takes will be an adventure 20 years in the making
Apr 20 09:38:01 <loskutak>	Hi, has anybody done org-mode startup visibility based on elisp predicates?  Basically, I would like datetree view with several previous days showing entry headings, this year showing month headings and the other years being collapsed.  So far, I set up each year with visibility property manually, but I don't want to do that for each day.
Apr 20 09:47:57 <derDere>	whats up anybody up for a talk
Apr 20 09:48:09 <codingquark>	about?
Apr 20 09:48:27 <codingquark>	I had some food and got 5-10min to kill!
Apr 20 09:48:28 <derDere>	duno I'm bored
Apr 20 09:48:55 <codingquark>	What do you think of Wolfram's Project Physics?
Apr 20 09:49:10 <codingquark>	They've managed to derive a lot of physics from basic computational rules!
Apr 20 09:49:44 <derDere>	never used wolfram so ...
Apr 20 09:49:50 <derDere>	no idea
Apr 20 09:49:57 <roadie>	I hope they put maximum physics into the Crysis Remaster
Apr 20 09:50:55 <derDere>	r u talking about the game?
Apr 20 09:51:01 <roadie>	yup
Apr 20 09:51:05 <derDere>	lol
Apr 20 09:51:08 <codingquark>	ha ha
Apr 20 09:51:18 <derDere>	jet another remaster
Apr 20 09:51:20 <roadie>	https://www.crysis.com
Apr 20 09:51:27 <derDere>	i hope its going to be better the wc3
Apr 20 09:51:41 <roadie>	whats wc3?
Apr 20 09:52:00 <derDere>	WarCraft3 Refun...orged
Apr 20 09:52:19 <roadie>	ah - warcraft 
Apr 20 09:52:33 <roadie>	never played that
Apr 20 09:52:57 <twb>	roadie: crysis runs inside chrome now?
Apr 20 09:53:12 <derDere>	i map-maked the crap out of it but with the new eula i wont even buy it
Apr 20 09:53:13 <codingquark>	You don't have to use wolfram
Apr 20 09:53:22 <codingquark>	Conceptually it is fascinating
Apr 20 09:53:39 <lockywolf__>	they rewrote Crysis in Wolfram Language?
Apr 20 09:53:51 <codingquark>	:'D
Apr 20 09:53:54 <derDere>	i don't think so xD
Apr 20 09:54:53 <lockywolf__>	loskutak, I haven't done it, but what you are describing sound useful. Would you mind sharing your setup?
Apr 20 09:55:02 <derDere>	codingquark: tell me about wolfram I only saw it once on rpi but never used it
Apr 20 09:55:58 <codingquark>	derDere: I too do not use the language.
Apr 20 09:56:22 <codingquark>	But the person Stephen Wolfram published this
Apr 20 09:57:32 <roadie>	twb: nope, its going to run on Switch though
Apr 20 09:57:56 <roadie>	lockywolf__: is wolfram written in Lua?
Apr 20 09:58:00 <derDere>	codingquark: oh ok, I'm gogoling it right now
Apr 20 09:59:04 <derDere>	roadie: no I think its a programming language on its own
Apr 20 09:59:51 <derDere>	roadie: but its lisp like (vagely)
Apr 20 10:00:58 <aidalgol>	twb: 1) How is the stealth broken?  2) How can you run 2033 on 2034?
Apr 20 10:01:09 <twb>	aidalgol: (2) is called "Metro 2033 Redux"
Apr 20 10:01:15 <twb>	aidalgol: so basically you re-buy the game
Apr 20 10:01:54 <twb>	re (1), there's no KO, only murder.  And you can't know when you're gonna be seen
Apr 20 10:03:47 <aidalgol>	Oh, I'm playing redux.
Apr 20 10:04:04 <aidalgol>	How *would* you know if you can be seen?
Apr 20 10:04:28 <aidalgol>	But yes, it feels like a pure stealth run would be keyboard-smashing levels of frustration.
Apr 20 10:05:59 <twb>	aidalgol: I can do metro 2 pacifist pretty easily
Apr 20 10:06:06 <winny>	codingquark: nice hn post
Apr 20 10:06:18 <twb>	metro 1 i give up during bourbon first human interaction because FUCK YOU YOU DIDN'T SEE ME
Apr 20 10:06:20 <codingquark>	winny: about wolfram?
Apr 20 10:06:32 <winny>	elfeed + tt
Apr 20 10:06:41 <codingquark>	What there's a post on HN now?
Apr 20 10:06:47 <lockywolf_>	I think some SRFIs even list it among potential users.
Apr 20 10:06:49 <twb>	aidalgol: *apparently* they fixed that in redux by letting metro 1 campaign have access to metro 2 interface/engine
Apr 20 10:06:50 <winny>	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22915200
Apr 20 10:07:05 <codingquark>	Alright, my server may not be equipped to handle the traffic :-P
Apr 20 10:08:02 <roadie>	its ok - it loads here
Apr 20 10:08:02 <winny>	:p
Apr 20 10:08:20 <winny>	tbh i just host my site on gitlab pages
Apr 20 10:09:27 <codingquark>	It won't be a problem for blog because it is cached static HTML
Apr 20 10:10:56 <codingquark>	Boy somebody has noticed me running all shit on RPi in my basement.
Apr 20 10:16:58 <aidalgol>	twb: I don't even know how I would get through the Nazis stealthing.
Apr 20 10:17:35 <aidalgol>	Although I suspect there's a hidden back passage, because I found a locked door *after* the battle area.
Apr 20 10:22:57 <roadie>	but first I want the AI fixed. The one that is running into the wall in the building across from the school.
Apr 20 10:26:37 <twb>	aidalgol: basically you just don't engage them
Apr 20 10:27:08 <twb>	aidalgol: you can easily ghost past most of that with a small amount of waiting for them to turn away, and some ledge jumps
Apr 20 10:57:30 <bpalmer>	rudybot: what do you know, video games to teach pacifism.
Apr 20 10:57:35 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I like pickled fish, but swedish pacifism annoys me.  so I guess that makes sense.
Apr 20 11:00:54 <bpalmer>	rudybot: annoys you? Annoys you enough to jump on some turtleshells and knock them out of the race?
Apr 20 11:01:23 <rudybot>	bpalmer: knock it off, or it'll be curtains for you!
Apr 20 12:06:39 <mokulus>	Hi, does any of you *not* use evil? How do you organize you keybindings?
Apr 20 12:07:28 <ecraven>	I use mostly normal emacs keybindings
Apr 20 12:07:40 <ecraven>	I use s-.. for "window management" stuff (using exwm)
Apr 20 12:08:11 <kensanata>	I use good Emacs. 
Apr 20 12:08:40 <kensanata>	Most of the extra key bindings are simple additions.
Apr 20 12:09:00 <mokulus>	Do you often use M-x? How do you bind/organize functions from many packages?
Apr 20 12:09:08 <codingquark>	#metoo
Apr 20 12:09:27 <codingquark>	Hmm, what do you mean organize?
Apr 20 12:10:49 <bremner>	mokulus: most bindings are mode specific, so they are organized by the active mode
Apr 20 12:12:54 <mokulus>	what about things like magit, do you bind it or just M-x?
Apr 20 12:13:15 <bremner>	I use C-c <letter> for global bindings like magit-status
Apr 20 12:13:23 <bremner>	this is pretty much the only safe choice
Apr 20 12:14:45 <mokulus>	and default emacs keybindings, like C-n C-p ?
Apr 20 12:14:56 <bremner>	I use them
Apr 20 12:15:53 <bremner>	I sense I did not understand the last question.
Apr 20 12:16:17 <ecraven>	I have a hydra on s-t for often-accessed functions, which includes magit
Apr 20 12:16:26 <ecraven>	(t on dvorak is under the right middle finger)
Apr 20 12:16:35 <bremner>	same to you buddy!
Apr 20 12:16:38 <ecraven>	I use C-n/p/f/b a lot
Apr 20 12:16:40 <kensanata>	haha
Apr 20 12:17:06 <mokulus>	do you use a special keyboard?
Apr 20 12:17:25 <ecraven>	I use a kinesis advantage, which is really neat for the thumb keys (c- m- s- in my case, I don't use h-)
Apr 20 12:18:48 <mokulus>	ahh, that explains a lot. thumbs are underused on regular keyboard, but on custom c- m- s- is nice
Apr 20 12:19:18 <ecraven>	definitely, I don't want to use non-thumb c-/m-/s- ever again ;)
Apr 20 12:19:32 <ecraven>	need to find a nice portable option, maybe an ergodox or atreus some day
Apr 20 12:34:13 <HappyPonyLand>	mokulus: I just change things I use often to something better
Apr 20 12:34:26 <HappyPonyLand>	e.g. C-x C-s -> C-j
Apr 20 12:36:59 <HappyPonyLand>	I don't even remember what C-j does out of the box. it's nothing I miss anyway
Apr 20 12:38:19 <HappyPonyLand>	same with C-o, which I use as a mnemonic for "open"
Apr 20 12:40:42 <HappyPonyLand>	I have a untrain-key function that just prints an error message, which I re-bind all these suboptimal defaults (e.g. C-x C-f) to so I stop using them
Apr 20 12:41:35 <HappyPonyLand>	(C-o for open file, not open newline, that is)
Apr 20 12:42:58 <bpalmer>	mokulus: by the way, case is important when you're talking about modifiers. Control and s , for example, is C-s , not c-s . This particularly comes up because shift and s is S-s , while super and s is s-s
Apr 20 12:44:29 <bpalmer>	mokulus: it is a convention that C-c <letter> and F6 through F9 are "reserved to the user" -- you shouldn't ever have to fight a good mode for control of those keys.
Apr 20 12:47:31 <bpalmer>	rudybot: is working confined at home the origin of the morlocks or the eloi?
Apr 20 12:47:39 <rudybot>	bpalmer: The Eloi keeping the Morlocks down, down in the subway.
Apr 20 12:48:38 <HappyPonyLand>	apparently I have freed C-n,b,f,d at some point since I find them really archaic, but forgotten to replace them with something better
Apr 20 12:49:14 <bpalmer>	C-n but not C-p ?
Apr 20 12:49:18 <HappyPonyLand>	C-p does something, but nothing I actually use
Apr 20 12:50:06 <bpalmer>	rudybot: look, don't make me regret creating a time machine by showing me the consequences of human action.
Apr 20 12:50:07 <HappyPonyLand>	(delete-horizontal-space, which I've superseded with a custom command that does the same thing but eats newlines as well)
Apr 20 12:50:21 <rudybot>	bpalmer: and for what it's worth, my parents both fought to end the draft and regret the consequences of that.
Apr 20 12:50:45 <bpalmer>	HappyPonyLand: Ah. that's where C-d at the end of a line comes in to play, to join lines together
Apr 20 12:51:11 <bpalmer>	I've rebound M-SPC from just-one-space to delete-horizontal-space, though
Apr 20 12:53:43 <codingquark>	After I run org-sparse-tree (C-c /) and run search for tag, where will the output go?
Apr 20 12:54:14 <HappyPonyLand>	I've been leaning back and forth between wanting to delete all whitespace, or leave a single space, but concluded that remembering multiple variations would still be more effort than just deleting everything, then manually entering that single space the times I want it.
Apr 20 12:54:26 <codingquark>	Ah, since I have all TODO as headings, it is not filtering well
Apr 20 12:54:27 <HappyPonyLand>	trying not to obsess over stuff
Apr 20 13:06:47 <bpalmer>	rudybot: what do you think of the perfume Obsession?
Apr 20 13:06:51 <rudybot>	bpalmer:       an essential oil from which a highly valued perfume is
Apr 20 13:07:43 <bremner>	O.o
Apr 20 13:22:00 <bad_blue_bull>	Hi
Apr 20 13:23:49 <bad_blue_bull>	I'm having a trouble fetching a site via eww
Apr 20 13:23:58 <bad_blue_bull>	yestarday I could do it
Apr 20 13:24:02 <bad_blue_bull>	today no longer
Apr 20 13:24:14 <bad_blue_bull>	(eww "https://modern.ircdocs.horse/index.html")
Apr 20 13:24:45 <bad_blue_bull>	didn't work everytime before today also
Apr 20 13:27:24 <bpalmer>	,doesntwork
Apr 20 13:27:25 <fsbot>	We can help you with your problem better if your error description is more informative than "it doesn't work"
Apr 20 13:34:19 <HappyPonyLand>	can you fetch the same document from another browser? can you fetch other documents with eww?
Apr 20 13:34:44 <HappyPonyLand>	(i.e. have you ruled out it's a network problem)
Apr 20 13:35:46 <fledermaus>	good morning plaguetopia.
Apr 20 13:36:23 <hodapp>	good morning batdude
Apr 20 13:37:10 <fledermaus>	aloha
Apr 20 13:38:31 <bpalmer>	rudybot: are we living in a timeline predicted by William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, or Steven Gould?
Apr 20 13:38:36 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I'm only thirtysomething; it'll be thirty short films about Glenn Gould
Apr 20 13:39:22 <bpalmer>	rudybot: he died in 1982! 
Apr 20 13:39:23 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Ah he died in 1982
Apr 20 13:39:46 <edgar-rft>	for a little money I can postdict what happened in the past
Apr 20 13:39:51 <HappyPonyLand>	what does rudybot do?
Apr 20 13:40:13 <bpalmer>	remind us about famed Canadian pianist Glenn Gould
Apr 20 13:40:14 <fledermaus>	slumber in the hiden depths, dreaming and waiting.
Apr 20 13:40:29 <fledermaus>	rudybot: ftaghn
Apr 20 13:40:29 <rudybot>	fledermaus: eh?  Try "rudybot: help".
Apr 20 13:40:39 <bpalmer>	he's no rush or justin bieber, but ...
Apr 20 13:42:52 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: what do you do?
Apr 20 13:42:53 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: what more do you want
Apr 20 13:44:02 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: I want all or nothing. I already have nothing, now gimme all!
Apr 20 13:44:14 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: autoloads M-x gimme-lotsa-money-for-doing-nothing
Apr 20 13:44:38 <edgar-rft>	that's at least a beginning...
Apr 20 13:45:53 <bad_blue_bull>	HappyPonyLand: exactly this site I can not fetch with eww
Apr 20 13:46:17 <bad_blue_bull>	maybe server problem
Apr 20 13:46:18 <bad_blue_bull>	likely
Apr 20 13:46:24 <bpalmer>	bad_blue_bull: does it work with other browsers?
Apr 20 13:46:25 <bad_blue_bull>	oh, succeeded this time
Apr 20 13:46:36 <bad_blue_bull>	yes no porblems with firefox
Apr 20 13:46:49 <bpalmer>	what happens when it fails?
Apr 20 13:46:57 <bad_blue_bull>	no error messages
Apr 20 13:47:03 <bad_blue_bull>	just void buffer
Apr 20 13:47:19 <bad_blue_bull>	not void, saying like 'loading site...'
Apr 20 13:47:38 <edgar-rft>	looks as if the internet is too fast for emacs
Apr 20 13:47:42 <bad_blue_bull>	maybe www server rejects eww time after time
Apr 20 13:53:55 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: today is Hitler's birthday
Apr 20 13:53:58 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: So according to today's webcomics, yesterday was associated with drug use instead of Hitler's birthday, because idiots write the date backwards.
Apr 20 14:04:34 <apteryx>	is there a better way to handle per project Emacs configurations than .dir-locals? My issue with .dir-locals is that it lives in the project sources, and is easy to loose since it's not commited. I'd rather have it centralized in my ~/.emacs.
Apr 20 14:13:06 <Defolos>	apteryx: if the location of your projects is kinda constant, then you can use stow to have all your .dir-locals in one repository and symlink them via stow to the respective project dirs
Apr 20 14:13:46 <apteryx>	Defolos: that's a good idea; thanks.
Apr 20 14:18:22 <bpalmer>	depending on what settings you're making, you can also tweak things in your .emacs that only take effect in certain project directories
Apr 20 14:18:45 <bpalmer>	for example, add a function to c++-mode-hook that does a switch based on the buffer-file-name to enable certain modes
Apr 20 14:20:34 <bad_blue_bull>	edgar-rft: "today is Hitler's birthday" LOL, today I've got a quote from Mein Kampf by Fortunes
Apr 20 14:35:44 <apteryx>	is there something built-in to find out the root of a versioned project directory?
Apr 20 14:37:42 <rpav>	apteryx: what are you trying to do 
Apr 20 14:38:10 <fledermaus>	depends on what precisely you mean by "versioned project directory"
Apr 20 14:38:26 <apteryx>	I'd like to define a before-save-hook function that'll be in effect only if some file exists at the root of the project
Apr 20 14:39:45 <apteryx>	fledermaus: versioned in the sense that it's using git or another commond version control system.
Apr 20 14:39:50 <apteryx>	common*
Apr 20 14:40:19 <rpav>	but not necessarily a projectile project? 
Apr 20 14:40:52 <fledermaus>	apteryx: well, git has git rev-parse --show-toplevel … but I don't know that there's a generic way for any random vcs 
Apr 20 14:41:32 <rpav>	yeah .. also note if you want to deal with submodules you more or less have to use the .. of rev-parse --git-dir 
Apr 20 14:41:42 <bpalmer>	git, mercurial and svn all have a dot dir at the root, so you can just search upwards
Apr 20 14:41:54 <bpalmer>	oh, true, git submodules complicate things
Apr 20 14:41:58 <apteryx>	rpav: not necessarily a projectile project (although, could that tool help in configuring per-project settings? I don't know it)
Apr 20 14:42:28 <bpalmer>	vc.el probably has something, but I don't know its internals very well
Apr 20 14:42:29 <fledermaus>	submodules bring only pain.
Apr 20 14:42:36 <rpav>	actually if you just make sure .git is a directory not a file, it should be fine .. i'm not sure --git-dir can even handle that
Apr 20 14:42:37 <fledermaus>	the path to the dark side they are. mhmm.
Apr 20 14:42:56 <bpalmer>	fledermaus: so, git, then?
Apr 20 14:43:13 <rpav>	hehe
Apr 20 14:43:23 <fledermaus>	bpalmer: git is fine. have you been drinking jordi's kool-aid?
Apr 20 14:43:42 <lukelau>	Hi, is there a way to give aspell/flyspell a more complete dictionary than the builtin en_GB one, and if so where could I find one?
Apr 20 14:43:45 <bpalmer>	git is ok, but has its own pain.
Apr 20 14:44:00 <lukelau>	The en_gb dictionary seems to be missing words like “automata” and “advection”
Apr 20 14:45:53 <bpalmer>	it's kind of weird that svn has lost all its shine
Apr 20 14:45:56 <apteryx>	bpalmer: I think I've found what vc.el uses: vc-git-root
Apr 20 14:46:35 <apteryx>	or more generally: (vc-find-root file ".git")
Apr 20 14:47:00 <bpalmer>	nice.
Apr 20 14:47:07 <fledermaus>	bpalmer: it had a narrow window of being a better VCS than what was available and then DVCS suddenly became A Thing 
Apr 20 14:48:12 <grym>	bpalmer: the branching model was pain, remote checkouts were slow, and i had to rebuild a server and pray at least twice...  i think i'm good on svn forever now :) 
Apr 20 14:48:19 <bpalmer>	except as is pointed out every time github goes down, many people using DVCS don't seem to care about the *d* part
Apr 20 14:49:19 <grym>	if you delete local branches too often, you can get yourself up shit creek i guess
Apr 20 14:49:43 <grym>	but if you don't, then at least github or gitlab going down mostly means "it's harder to share changes now" instead of "my work history is gone"
Apr 20 14:50:08 <fledermaus>	bpalmer: I am unwilling to discard the advantages of DVCS because of other people's inability to plan
Apr 20 14:50:32 <fledermaus>	indeed, DVCS _insulates_ me from what would be a catastrophe if those people were in charge and using a VCS 
Apr 20 14:50:47 <edgar-rft>	bad_blue_bull: that was no joke, today *is* Hitler's birthday, but we should be more happy that Hitler is dead
Apr 20 14:51:11 <grym>	edgar-rft: more importantly, if we all meet at that statue outside of high school i hear there's a whole field of weed for the pickin'
Apr 20 14:51:22 <fledermaus>	edgar-rft: he did one good thing! he killed hitler.
Apr 20 14:51:53 <fledermaus>	although I guess he also killed the guy who killed hitler…
Apr 20 14:51:58 *	bpalmer departs for fields of productivity
Apr 20 14:52:02 <fledermaus>	get some coffee in, I feel an all-nighter coming on.
Apr 20 14:53:41 <fledermaus>	we played an interesting scenario at ambercon ni this year (before lockdown) - our time travel team (or _a_ team, maybe not us) spannered the timeline.
Apr 20 14:53:45 <fledermaus>	and made it better.
Apr 20 14:54:23 <fledermaus>	reduced wars in the middle ages. no black death. no WWI or II or holocaust.
Apr 20 14:54:40 <fledermaus>	no imminent environmental catastrophe.
Apr 20 14:55:12 <fledermaus>	we decided we couldn't "fix" the timeline, nobody wanted to be responsible for all that.
Apr 20 14:58:42 <grym>	fledermaus: reminds me of "who is your verlensky?" https://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2015/11/16/going-back-in-time-to-kill-verlensky-as-an-infant/
Apr 20 15:01:04 <grym>	fledermaus:  uh, tangentially, have you ever read heinlein's "all you zombies"
Apr 20 15:02:26 <bzp>	Hello everyone, what program do you recommend to synchronize files (school work) from a desktop pc with my laptop.
Apr 20 15:03:12 <bremner>	I use git for that. A bit of learning curve, but useful skills
Apr 20 15:03:32 <bremner>	oh. but my schoolwork is text files
Apr 20 15:03:44 <sm>	git-annex can be good for big files
Apr 20 15:04:34 <edgar-rft>	tit for tat, and git for that
Apr 20 15:04:44 <grym>	bzp: git for any text-based file whose history you care about and sometimes assorted small binary files to go along with.  otherwise, i use a mix of google drive, onedrive, and icloud
Apr 20 15:04:58 <bzp>	I use task text files
Apr 20 15:04:59 <celadevra>	+1 for git-annex. If you don't need version control there's unison
Apr 20 15:05:06 <sm>	I'd start with rsync personally. Unison used to be also somewhat useful - yes
Apr 20 15:05:57 <grym>	bzp: i version my lab notebook in git, for instance
Apr 20 15:07:50 <bzp>	git-annex, I think it can be useful. Is it installed only in emacs or in the system?
Apr 20 15:08:29 <grym>	bzp: system-wide
Apr 20 15:09:50 <bzp>	can it be used from emacs?
Apr 20 15:10:35 <celadevra>	John Wiegley wrote some backends to org-attach that utilizes git-annex, iirc
Apr 20 15:12:23 <celadevra>	other than that I don't know any extension that uses it in emacs. It is a bunch of commands so you can use it from eshell and ansi-term, for example.
Apr 20 15:15:30 <bzp>	do you have any good tutorial for git-annex, could you share me please.
Apr 20 15:17:22 <rpav>	gah projectile is such a pos
Apr 20 15:17:33 <grym>	bzp: how much data are we talking about here 
Apr 20 15:18:54 <bzp>	2mb - 4mb, are .txt and .org files
Apr 20 15:20:09 <celadevra>	bzp: https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/ official and only, it seems
Apr 20 15:20:24 <grym>	bzp: just make a private github repo and stuff it all there from everywhere
Apr 20 15:20:46 <bzp>	notes, notes and tasks done in .txt and .org
Apr 20 15:21:00 <grym>	no need to go nuts on tooling 
Apr 20 15:21:27 <bzp>	10:17 -%- npostavs [~user@CPE001143542e1f-CMf81d0f809fa0.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com] has joined #emacs
Apr 20 15:21:30 <bzp>	10:18 < bzp> 2mb - 4mb, are .txt and .org files
Apr 20 15:21:35 <grym>	my lab notebook is about 200 megs 
Apr 20 15:21:44 <grym>	all on github 
Apr 20 15:22:26 <bzp>	10:17 -%- npostavs [~user@CPE001143542e1f-CMf81d0f809fa0.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com] has joined #emacs
Apr 20 15:22:29 <bzp>	10:18 < bzp> 2mb - 4mb, are .txt and .org files
Apr 20 15:22:31 <grym>	mostly org and embedded images
Apr 20 15:22:34 <grym>	bzp: ummm 
Apr 20 15:22:55 <celadevra>	bzp: on my 2012 laptop emacs handles text files around that size without breaking any sweat.
Apr 20 15:23:07 <celadevra>	In that case you don't need git-annex
Apr 20 15:23:12 <grym>	it'd better, 4 mb files are tiny 
Apr 20 15:23:15 <celadevra>	Just use git
Apr 20 15:24:32 <bzp>	or what do you propose for my case?
Apr 20 15:24:44 <bpalmer>	unless that 4MB file happens to all be on one line...
Apr 20 15:25:11 <bpalmer>	git, btw, doesn't handle *automatic* synchronization; you have to remember to commit your changes to some accessible repository
Apr 20 15:26:22 <bpalmer>	I think chosen commits are usually a useful thing, but if you're frequently switching machines and having semi-completed work in progress, git may not be an ideal workflow
Apr 20 15:31:59 <wgreenhouse>	bzp: git-annex can be used from emacs. there is a magit-annex library, which extends magit with git-annex features
Apr 20 15:32:34 <wgreenhouse>	I use this sort of setup--the notes are just commited to git, large attachments that I don't edit are annexed
Apr 20 15:32:58 <wgreenhouse>	(large attachments meaning mostly collections of PDFs related to research, in my case)
Apr 20 15:33:46 <wgreenhouse>	I do a git annex sync --content at quasimeaningful times, usually when clocking out
Apr 20 15:34:37 <wgreenhouse>	(that commits the parts that are checked in to git (the org files) and also sends the attachments to every remote where git annex rules say they get a copy
Apr 20 15:36:00 <wgreenhouse>	I agree with bpalmer that git isn't an ideal fit for notes you are continuously opening and editing in multiple places. but it at least gives you version control that's accessible from emacs
Apr 20 15:37:51 <miskatonic>	are svn and cvs no longer accessible from emacs?
Apr 20 15:38:27 <wgreenhouse>	miskatonic: they are, of course (vc-mode).
Apr 20 15:38:41 <wgreenhouse>	and even bzr and darcs
Apr 20 15:38:41 <bpalmer>	I wouldn't recommend CVS for, hmm, anybody nowadays.
Apr 20 15:38:52 <grym>	miskatonic: i bet you can rcs still 
Apr 20 15:38:56 <wgreenhouse>	you sure can
Apr 20 15:39:00 <bremner>	I would recommend CVS for someone I didn't like
Apr 20 15:39:01 <bpalmer>	if you're using only a single file, RCS may be suitable
Apr 20 15:39:32 <bpalmer>	bremner: there's always bzr for that
Apr 20 15:39:38 <wgreenhouse>	,,src,, (rcs, rewritten in python, and without the locking/unlocking thing) could be nice for notes
Apr 20 15:39:40 <fsbot>	hmm, src is Simple Revision Control, a new version control system, at http://www.catb.org/esr/src/
Apr 20 15:40:04 <bremner>	depends how you feel about esrware :P
Apr 20 15:40:12 <rpav>	erm, how does one recover from infinite recursion in elisp .. quitting the debugger seems to continue the function, which is *helpful*
Apr 20 15:40:29 <bpalmer>	rpav: C-g ? 
Apr 20 15:40:34 <bremner>	C-g a lot
Apr 20 15:40:36 <grym>	bremner: well i do know how to clean a pistol, but i'm not so sure about this skyclad bit in the instructions 
Apr 20 15:40:42 <rpav>	apparently, thanks
Apr 20 15:41:25 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: in theory not great,  but I used fetchmail for many years, so by revealed preference I seem to like it
Apr 20 15:41:26 <bpalmer>	A side-effect of lexical binding might be that max-specpdl-size won't necessarily break infinite loops.
Apr 20 15:43:32 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: not many others have been crazy enough to write an IMAP IDLE client
Apr 20 15:44:58 <bpalmer>	,eler
Apr 20 15:45:00 <fsbot>	bpalmer, eler -- everybody loves eric raymond, http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archive/show-them-the-code
Apr 20 15:45:01 <bremner>	wgreenhouse: I used fetchmail. Then I switched to getmail, and then to 300 line python script called imap-dl.
Apr 20 15:45:31 <bremner>	because it turns out in the meantime, the python standard library does lots of things these other tool reinvented
Apr 20 15:45:50 <bremner>	but yeah, IMAP IDLE is not a thing I care about
Apr 20 15:46:54 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: if the 300-line script does IDLE and either leaves the mail in a maildir for subsequent sorting, or lets me shell out to (the insanity deepens) procmail, I'd gladly throw fetchmail and its opaque config files and error messages out the airlock
Apr 20 15:47:21 <bpalmer>	hmm, not sure when eler started, but I wonder if there was a transition period 
Apr 20 15:48:47 <bremner>	wgreenhouse: I guess not to IDLE, but here it is https://github.com/spwhitton/mailscripts/blob/master/imap-dl
Apr 20 15:49:29 <apteryx>	is it possible to get access to some context when in a hook function? Like, which file triggered the hook.
Apr 20 15:49:57 <bpalmer>	apteryx: a mode hook will be run from within the buffer that is in that mode. So, see buffer-file-name
Apr 20 15:50:18 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: thanks!
Apr 20 15:50:43 <bremner>	it's in debian package mailscripts.
Apr 20 15:50:56 <apteryx>	bpalmer: thanks
Apr 20 15:52:18 <rpav>	haha, now i need a vc-root function, which is apparently (vc-root-dir)
Apr 20 15:52:47 <apteryx>	bpalmer: found some ready to consume code for a hook here: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/48503. Interestingly, it uses a `locate-dominating-file' to search the directory hierarchy for a given file.
Apr 20 15:54:47 <bpalmer>	aye, I should have thought of that.
Apr 20 15:57:26 <fledermaus>	grym: zombies? yes, I think I did read that, many moons ago.
Apr 20 15:58:07 <bremner>	bah, I don't want to read about zombies, I prefer escapist fiction.
Apr 20 15:59:50 <bpalmer>	all you zombies's zombies are a bit different than your usual ol' zombies
Apr 20 16:00:12 <fledermaus>	I hear pro-deathers are marching in support of the plague over in Eaglestan.
Apr 20 16:00:38 <fledermaus>	waving their guns and racism flags and demanding an end to anti-plague measures and whatnot.
Apr 20 16:00:40 <bpalmer>	Aye. It's a weird world.
Apr 20 16:00:52 <tromey>	give me liberty and give me death
Apr 20 16:01:07 <fledermaus>	tromey: their terms are acceptable to me.
Apr 20 16:01:25 <bpalmer>	There was a newspaper photo that closely resembled Shaun of the Dead; I'm sure that's been going around.
Apr 20 16:01:42 <rpav>	fledermaus: i feel if that goes on for a bit, it'll sort itself out heh
Apr 20 16:02:02 <bpalmer>	https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/shaun-of-the-dead-protesters/
Apr 20 16:02:26 <fledermaus>	rpav: it's not the maga-hatted incellectuals getting sick that bothers me - it's the innocent people they'll go on to infect.
Apr 20 16:03:17 <rpav>	fledermaus: maybe, but, i think if everyone else is staying well enough away i'm not sure how much it changes the odds
Apr 20 16:04:50 <rpav>	bpalmer: zombies do exist! 
Apr 20 16:06:18 <grym>	fledermaus: they're agitprop ptompkein devos-funded professional trolls; ignore and move on 
Apr 20 16:06:52 <fledermaus>	wouldn't gunning them down be more american?
Apr 20 16:07:02 <grym>	only if they're black 
Apr 20 16:07:04 <grym>	which they aren't 
Apr 20 16:07:13 <fledermaus>	silly me.
Apr 20 16:07:16 <fledermaus>	I forgot.

Apr 20 21:50:21 <roadie>	so a barrel of oil is going to cost as much as the real black gold, a can of coke?
Apr 20 21:50:50 <e1f>	a pint of beer costs more than a pint of oil
Apr 20 21:51:25 <roadie>	ah, figures
Apr 20 21:51:38 <Wafficus>	Question regarding Emacs with email and ZenDesk, does anyone recommend any easy way to incorporate workflows to use Emacs instead of directly having to use Office365 email and ZenDesk directly?
Apr 20 21:54:02 <wdecay>	does anyone know what enables/disables the header in org mode which has |ITEM| TODO | PRI | TAGS | in it? I occasionally press a wrong key and enter this mode and then can't turn it off :(
Apr 20 21:55:26 <Wafficus>	isn't it C-c C-t?
Apr 20 21:57:07 <e1f>	m-x describe-mode will tell you all the bindings
Apr 20 21:58:28 <wdecay>	e1f: i know that problem is i don't know what triggered it.... C-c C-t is bound to org-columns-todo... trying to find how to undo it now
Apr 20 21:58:59 <e1f>	m-x view-lossage will show the last few keypresses
Apr 20 21:59:39 <wdecay>	oh that's nice!
Apr 20 22:03:24 <wdecay>	lol... it's disabled by org-columns-quit... what in the world is these column overlays are for? seems like such an unintuitive feature
Apr 20 22:04:16 <e1f>	and org itself is intuitive?
Apr 20 22:04:17 <Wafficus>	neat "m-x describe-mode" idea
Apr 20 22:04:30 <Wafficus>	never knew that, super helpful
Apr 20 22:04:39 <e1f>	indeed
Apr 20 22:19:51 <afleck>	what's the best way to set a per-user "tramp-histfile-override"? I have files I need to edit as users with no home directory. I suppose I don't really have a need for the tramp history file, so setting it to "/dev/null" globally is fine now
Apr 20 22:20:21 <afleck>	but a more elegant solution would be nice
Apr 20 22:27:20 <afleck>	moreover, is there any rationale behind the decision to make tramp totally barf if it can't create a history file?
Apr 20 22:34:26 <noobly>	I'm trying to graph (using emacs-calc + gnuplot) x^2 natural_log(8+x^3), but I can't figure out how to do so on emacs-calc. for the Y (first on stack) I have (in algebraic mode) x^2 L(x^3 + 8), for x (the interval) [-2, 2], but the erorr is 'plotdata1 not suitable for plotdata2.. any tips? I've also been trying latex input

Apr 21 00:03:38 <rpav>	wtf does quitting some helm mode help resize all my frames
Apr 21 00:07:16 <vvor>	Helm is a monster. Do you realy need it :)
Apr 21 00:07:35 <rpav>	o.O
Apr 21 00:07:49 <rpav>	you like push a key and you can search some things .. not really my definition of monster
Apr 21 00:09:36 <vvor>	Among the press a key  for search it is ;-)
Apr 21 00:39:10 <mtellez>	Hi, how can I customize org mode source blocks to show an icon instead of #+begin_src python ? Sometime ago found a link to do that, but can't find it any more.
Apr 21 00:40:10 <nikitam>	That'd be nifty.
Apr 21 00:41:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	mtellez: I'd take a look at how the org entities thing works. The code can probably be reused.
Apr 21 00:41:33 <ryouma>	org bullets might have clues
Apr 21 00:42:12 <mtellez>	I think it was something like org-emphasis-alist works
Apr 21 00:44:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If you do figure it out again, it sounds neat, please share.
Apr 21 00:46:55 <mtellez>	Aurora_v_kosmose: of course!
Apr 21 00:47:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	:)
Apr 21 00:47:50 <fengshaun>	I'm seeing references to emacs 27 and 28, but I'm only seeing emacs 26 on emacs.org, where do I find this mythical v28?
Apr 21 00:48:21 <fengshaun>	apparently has an early-init.el
Apr 21 00:49:34 <dale>	fengshaun: Build from source.  emacs-27 branch has 27, master is 28.
Apr 21 00:49:38 <nikitam>	fengshaun: you can build it here http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/
Apr 21 00:50:00 <fengshaun>	oh, no binaries, that's why I couldn't find anything
Apr 21 00:50:10 <fengshaun>	any list of differences?
Apr 21 00:50:16 <mplsCorwin>	There are precompiled binaries for the 27 pre-release. See topic.
Apr 21 00:50:36 <fengshaun>	second pre-test, nice
Apr 21 00:50:44 <dale>	mplsCorwin: Am I missing a URL for the binaries there?
Apr 21 00:51:11 <fengshaun>	no binary url in the topic
Apr 21 00:51:18 <mplsCorwin>	Hrm.  I'll dig.
Apr 21 00:52:01 <mplsCorwin>	Are binaries only for us poor windows users? https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/windows/emacs-27/
Apr 21 00:52:13 <dale>	fengshaun: https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/emacs-27/etc/NEWS https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/NEWS
Apr 21 00:52:31 <mplsCorwin>	No, there's tgz up a few directories I see.
Apr 21 00:52:38 <fengshaun>	thanks a lot! :D
Apr 21 00:52:42 <dale>	mplsCorwin: That would not surprise me.  Most all other platforms have compilers fairly easily available.
Apr 21 00:52:43 <fengshaun>	mplsCorwin, alas!
Apr 21 00:53:09 <fengshaun>	I wouldn't mind compiling on linux or fbsd, but windows I can't deal with :S
Apr 21 00:53:38 <dale>	mplsCorwin: The tgz there is just source, no binaries, methinks.
Apr 21 00:53:45 <mplsCorwin>	dale: are these all source archives in https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/pretest/ ?
Apr 21 00:53:46 <mplsCorwin>	LOL
Apr 21 00:53:48 <mplsCorwin>	yea
Apr 21 01:01:49 <e1f>	alright, that's it for me for this week. see you whenever, guys.
Apr 21 01:03:59 <fengshaun>	wow, harfbuzz? nice
Apr 21 01:04:09 <fengshaun>	I heard it's supposed to make things look nice
Apr 21 01:41:57 <lampilelo>	RMS still talks about variable-pitch text on emacs-devel
Apr 21 01:43:48 <ryouma>	lampilelo: is that good or bad?  sounds good to me, although i have no idea what you are referring to.
Apr 21 01:43:59 <ryouma>	i use variable pitch for everything i possibly can in emacs.  or i try to.
Apr 21 01:44:40 <lampilelo>	he wants wyswig editing so he won't have to use libreoffice
Apr 21 01:45:09 <ryouma>	sounds good to me, but that has ben an idea that has taken a long time to not take off yet :)
Apr 21 01:45:35 <ryouma>	getting variable pitch under control is a good start
Apr 21 01:46:29 <lampilelo>	there was a discussion some time ago on emacs-devel about roadmap and he raised that issue, but noone was interested in that, they all much rather wanted to have good long lines performance and stuff like that
Apr 21 01:46:37 <rpav>	wysiwyg seems overrated ;/
Apr 21 01:46:53 <winny>	did you know that plain text is wysiwyg
Apr 21 01:46:58 <ryouma>	https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9d0zht/did_richard_stallman_write_all_of_emacs/
Apr 21 01:47:06 <ryouma>	(unrelated)
Apr 21 01:47:13 <rpav>	winny: a fair point! ;)
Apr 21 01:47:52 <lampilelo>	the consensus was that if he wants that feature he can contribute it to the code
Apr 21 01:49:58 <ryouma>	what are the big issues in wysiwyg?
Apr 21 01:50:20 <ryouma>	(i am much mnore itnerested in variable pitch)
Apr 21 01:51:09 <lampilelo>	the issue is someone needs to implement it 
Apr 21 01:52:01 <wgreenhouse>	maybe what he really needs is a mailclient for GNU TeXmacs
Apr 21 01:52:17 <wgreenhouse>	It's mostly wysiwyg and is a lispy emacs
Apr 21 01:52:35 <wgreenhouse>	If it had rmail, rms could live there 
Apr 21 01:52:54 <rpav>	let's implement DTeX .. like DPS/DPDF, but 
Apr 21 01:56:52 <mtellez>	Hi, I found a way to change the org's #+begin_src line: https://pank.eu/blog/pretty-babel-src-blocks.html
Apr 21 01:57:23 <wgreenhouse>	lampilelo: I don't think it's clear yet what someone would implement 
Apr 21 01:57:27 <mtellez>	I'm still can't use all-the-icons symbols, but it is a start.
Apr 21 01:58:38 <wgreenhouse>	variable pitch in buffers is easy (looks great in eww) but doesn't somehow equal being a word processor 
Apr 21 01:59:39 <ryouma>	still needs a little work.  to make it turnkey, to deal with fonts that don't resale, etc. it seems to me at least
Apr 21 02:02:08 <lampilelo>	to have a full word processor we'd have to be able to use multiple fonts in one buffer
Apr 21 02:02:46 <wgreenhouse>	lampilelo: and interop with openoffice xml or rtf
Apr 21 02:03:42 <wgreenhouse>	seriously a general computing environment based in texmacs would be kind of neat 
Apr 21 02:04:03 <wgreenhouse>	rudybot: think of the computer modern roman, and the beautiful kerning
Apr 21 02:04:16 <rudybot>	wgreenhouse: actually the kerning on that poster is really bothering me
Apr 21 02:07:20 <cjb>	https://hellveticafont.com/
Apr 21 02:10:40 <rpav>	haha
Apr 21 02:26:38 <ryouma>	we can't alraedy?  --- 18:02 <lampilelo> to have a full word processor we'd have to be able to use multiple fonts in one buffer
Apr 21 02:29:08 <lampilelo>	i don't know, really, can we?
Apr 21 02:29:43 <ryouma>	i do it all the time
Apr 21 02:29:51 <ryouma>	so dunno, maybe i am supernatural
Apr 21 02:30:55 <ryouma>	i could make your name much bigger or smaller!
Apr 21 02:31:04 <ryouma>	if i ... worked at it
Apr 21 02:32:29 <lampilelo>	is it simple to do? i guess you do it by changing text properties but that's a part of emacs i havent yet explored
Apr 21 02:36:52 <ryouma>	yes
Apr 21 02:37:05 <ryouma>	go use org; it's built in
Apr 21 02:38:03 <lhx>	lampilelo: org isn't wysiwyg but it's damn nice
Apr 21 02:39:31 <rpav>	i find markdown or simple text with visual-line-mode and adaptive-prefix work for like 99% of everything i want, and nothing works for the remaining 1% ;/
Apr 21 02:39:32 <wgreenhouse>	org is something nicer than wysiwyg. It's a structured document editor :)
Apr 21 02:40:02 <ryouma>	filladapt works for the stuff adative prefix does not work on.  if you fix a tiny bug.
Apr 21 02:40:20 <lampilelo>	i know about org, i was talking about fonts
Apr 21 02:40:21 <rpav>	surprisingly (?) none of the text document format things are very good at integrating data and like .. formula evaluation? .. or something. it's probably a pretty specific need though heh
Apr 21 02:40:32 <rpav>	filladapt actually wraps text
Apr 21 02:40:34 <grym>	lampilelo: you get fonts when you C-e l o :) 
Apr 21 02:40:49 <ryouma>	rpav: ?
Apr 21 02:40:55 <rpav>	err, i mean adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode
Apr 21 02:41:13 <ryouma>	ah
Apr 21 02:41:15 <rpav>	it's sortof like adaptive prefix but for visual-line-mode, and it actually works
Apr 21 02:41:26 <rpav>	it's pretty neat
Apr 21 02:41:38 <ryouma>	does it have a fill column?  i am totally unwilling to wrap at right edge or screw with margins etc.
Apr 21 02:41:51 <rpav>	i use visual-fill-column for that
Apr 21 02:42:00 <ryouma>	i am getting lost in all the kludges

Apr 21 08:19:04 <bpalmer>	lockywolf: I don't know scheme very well, but my guess would be that scheme doesn't require the implementation track names 
Apr 21 08:19:41 <bpalmer>	although R7RS has parameters which do handle dynamic scope, so you could probably use a parameter for that
Apr 21 08:20:21 <lockywolf>	I mean, binding is important at the moment of application, where is determines which objects are visible to the function body. I can easily imagine (define) defining functions that have access to the definition environment, (defun) to define ones that access runtime-environment objects, and, say (defpure) for functions that only have access to opencoded primitives.
Apr 21 08:21:04 <lockywolf>	I'd better ask this on #scheme, I guess :)
Apr 21 08:21:14 <bpalmer>	aye, they'd probably know the truth
Apr 21 08:21:35 <bpalmer>	although they'll never admit that all non-nil values are true
Apr 21 08:22:00 <lockywolf>	Emacs Lisp has (lexical-binding) though, so is sortof the only language that supports both of those, and still not at the same time.
Apr 21 08:22:33 <bpalmer>	common lisp, perl, and raku also support both lexical binding and dynamic scope.
Apr 21 08:24:11 <lockywolf>	(parameterize) in scheme allows breaking lexical isolation, as you said.
Apr 21 08:30:02 <bpalmer>	rudybot: I don't know that thinking tanks belong on the battlefield
Apr 21 08:30:25 <rudybot>	bpalmer: there were other problems during training as well. Like, tanks being stationary, no real emulation of battlefield conditions, etc
Apr 21 08:31:10 <parsnip>	is the stationary to give them paper cuts?
Apr 21 08:31:56 <parsnip>	is this the next jason bourne movie?
Apr 21 08:33:39 <bpalmer>	there's some anime about tank drivers who go to high school
Apr 21 08:34:28 <bpalmer>	'Of the many activities high school students can participate in, one of the most popular is "sensha-dō" (戦車道, lit. "the way of the tank"),[FN 1] the art of operating tanks, which is considered a traditional martial art.'
Apr 21 08:35:59 <bpalmer>	One presumes in this universe there are far fewer MMA fighters challenging traditional martial artists.
Apr 21 08:38:17 <twb>	bpalmer: I watched it, it's not meant to be taken seriously
Apr 21 08:39:00 <twb>	it has 12yo kids refubishing panzer and shooting at each other, but the worst injury is a scraped knee
Apr 21 08:39:29 <twb>	I think it's meant to be a parody of kendo &c classes
Apr 21 08:40:36 <bpalmer>	rudybot: are you more frightened of failing physics or kendo?
Apr 21 08:40:39 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Does Japanese fencing exist? With actual swords? Or is it just kendo?
Apr 21 08:41:11 <twb>	bpalmer: obviously you should actually be watching these guys: https://youtu.be/91AaMFZYW_w
Apr 21 08:42:00 <wasamasa>	rudybot: seen kodein
Apr 21 08:42:01 <rudybot>	wasamasa: kodein was seen in #emacs two weeks ago, saying "what a boring person", and then kodein was seen changing their nick to jbe in fukushima.lysator.liu.se one week ago
Apr 21 08:42:13 <jbe>	wasamasa: sup?
Apr 21 08:42:18 <wasamasa>	so sneaky of you
Apr 21 08:42:21 <twb>	bpalmer: I think it's also just that the author was a tank fanboy
Apr 21 08:42:45 <twb>	bpalmer: the same way that there's an anime about baking bread, and an anime about playing go
Apr 21 08:47:52 <wasamasa>	I've read the bread manga
Apr 21 08:48:13 <wasamasa>	it started out as fun and educational and eventually turned into saving the world from bread baking monsters
Apr 21 08:48:30 <jbe>	that's basically how the arcs tend to play out yeah
Apr 21 08:48:40 <wasamasa>	which was a major letdown
Apr 21 08:48:49 <jbe>	same with e.g. the cooking manga
Apr 21 08:49:18 <jbe>	"oh no the new headmaster's evil plan is to make every restaurant in the world the same, he must be stopped"
Apr 21 08:49:41 <twb>	everybody shumps the jark sooner or later

Apr 21 08:59:28 <libertyprime>	:O i havent heard of regexp-opt, but it's super cool there is something like it for elisp
Apr 21 08:59:39 <libertyprime>	Most likely, it's a lot more powerful though
Apr 21 09:00:19 <twb>	libertyprime: in elisp just use rx and avoid legacy 1960s notation entirely
Apr 21 09:01:11 <aidalgol>	twb: Have you seen the dating sim "parody" with tank girls?
Apr 21 09:01:34 <twb>	aidalgol: do you mean tankers, or literally anthroporphic tanks
Apr 21 09:01:56 <twb>	aidalgol: because for the latter there's uh.. kantai collection?  Which is mostly anthropomorphic naval vessels
Apr 21 09:01:56 <aidalgol>	anthroporphic tanks
Apr 21 09:02:03 <aidalgol>	well, not really
Apr 21 09:02:18 <aidalgol>	they're tanks who appear as school girls when on screen.
Apr 21 09:02:20 <twb>	There's also taht one where the girls all have boots with propellers

Apr 21 09:04:59 <aidalgol>	It's like someone only *heard of* parodies, and then tried to make one.
Apr 21 09:06:13 <twb>	I was playing that star wars game the other day and thinking not many people realize it's called "Star Destroyer" because it's a naval destroyer-class vessel In Spaaaaaaaace
Apr 21 09:06:19 <twb>	not because it destroys stars
Apr 21 09:07:00 <twb>	the same way an "astro-naut" doesn't actually colonize the surface of a star and plant corn and raise sheep
Apr 21 09:07:35 <wasamasa>	that reminds me of one song in Nu Pogodi

Apr 21 09:26:52 <wasamasa>	that's a lot of episodes
Apr 21 09:27:03 <jbe>	aren't ducks sexually dimorphic
Apr 21 09:27:43 <wasamasa>	well, it's not so clear with this one

Apr 21 09:57:26 <codingquark>	I shall give public acknowledgment, if that is your jam.
Apr 21 09:57:31 <twb>	codingquark: bruce bethke, cyberpunk?
Apr 21 09:57:45 <codingquark>	twb: read multiple times.
Apr 21 09:58:18 <twb>	codingquark: the Charles Stross santa story?
Apr 21 09:58:42 <codingquark>	twb: that I have not read.
Apr 21 09:58:47 <codingquark>	Doing that right now.
Apr 21 09:59:50 <wasamasa>	there's a RMS story about a robot and a baby
Apr 21 10:00:21 <codingquark>	twb: internet is not giving good results for santa story charles stross :(
Apr 21 10:01:17 <twb>	Stross' short stories Down on the Farm, Overtime, and Equoid are within the same Laundry continuity.
Apr 21 10:01:20 <twb>	I think it's _Overtime_
Apr 21 10:02:02 <codingquark>	How short is it though? That dude writes _a lot_ even in his blog posts
Apr 21 10:02:09 <twb>	>shrug<
Apr 21 10:02:47 <wasamasa>	why computers though
Apr 21 10:02:53 <wasamasa>	things get more fun without them
Apr 21 10:03:15 <codingquark>	Are they?
Apr 21 10:03:53 <twb>	yeah computers are terribly boring
Apr 21 10:03:58 <wasamasa>	for example How To Talk To Girls At Parties by Neil Gaiman is a properly weird story
Apr 21 10:04:00 <twb>	navigatrices are more fun
Apr 21 10:04:30 <codingquark>	wasamasa: there is a movie by that exact same name, says popcorntime
Apr 21 10:04:42 <wasamasa>	I've read the comic, dunno about a movie
Apr 21 10:05:33 <wasamasa>	or was it a comic
Apr 21 10:05:39 <wasamasa>	definitely not a movie
Apr 21 10:05:41 <sonjah>	hi how can i pass a line to a shell command or a script in emacs?
Apr 21 10:05:46 <twb>	gaiman is the sort of person who WOULD make a movie
Apr 21 10:06:02 <codingquark>	I have been reading Cryptonomicon. Some 350 pages and still not finding it as compelling
Apr 21 10:06:22 <miskatonic>	rudybot: neil gaiman or charles stross?
Apr 21 10:06:23 <rudybot>	miskatonic: ep 4 ' the doctor's wife' is written by neil gaiman
Apr 21 10:06:32 <kensanata>	codingquark: I've stopped reading much earlier than that.
Apr 21 10:07:26 <codingquark>	kensanata: I have been wanting to stop. But I was once reading wiki and it said "ultimate geek book" or something like that, which made me hope it will pick up at some point.
Apr 21 10:07:33 <codingquark>	I am still waiting for that point to come.
Apr 21 10:08:58 <twb>	codingquark: I think whatshisname had ONE good book
Apr 21 10:09:15 <twb>	I mean... Stephenson
Apr 21 10:10:10 <codingquark>	twb: Snow Crash?
Apr 21 10:10:15 <twb>	yeah
Apr 21 10:10:24 <twb>	Oh that's cool Diamond Age mentions Detective Dee
Apr 21 10:10:41 <twb>	Which is basically chinese Sherlock Holmes
Apr 21 10:11:26 <twb>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrated_Cases_of_Judge_Dee
Apr 21 10:12:18 <codingquark>	Oh, that URL shots Sherlock Holmes
Apr 21 10:12:23 <codingquark>	*shouts
Apr 21 10:13:07 <twb>	codingquark: that's an artefact of you reading about it in English
Apr 21 10:13:10 <wasamasa>	https://www.neilgaiman.com/Cool_Stuff/Short_Stories/How_To_Talk_To_Girls_At_Parties/How_To_Talk_To_Girls_At_Parties_(Text)
Apr 21 10:13:10 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/xVJrmkHtsn
Apr 21 10:13:13 <wasamasa>	there's more short stories of course
Apr 21 10:13:42 <wasamasa>	ah, I thought of another comic by his
Apr 21 10:13:51 <codingquark>	wasamasa: thanks dude but I've already wasted many minutes bitching about books instead of actually reading :-P
Apr 21 10:13:56 <wasamasa>	The Day I Swapped My Dad For Two Goldfish
Apr 21 10:14:08 <wasamasa>	which is equally weird, though without teenage angst
Apr 21 10:14:16 <twb>	codingquark: have you read "have spacesuit will travel"
Apr 21 10:14:37 <miskatonic>	rudybot: cryptonomicon or necronomicon?
Apr 21 10:14:37 <rudybot>	miskatonic: what's harder to read: cryptonomicon or necronomicon?
Apr 21 10:15:05 <codingquark>	I have not
Apr 21 10:16:03 <codingquark>	Looks like a _lot_ of books have been nominated for Hugo
Apr 21 10:18:36 <miskatonic>	rudybot: hugo or nebula award?
Apr 21 10:18:36 <rudybot>	miskatonic: I really did not enjoy her "Among Others", but the people who award the Nebula, Hugo, and British Fantasy Awards disagree
Apr 21 10:20:16 <codingquark>	I shall read both the stories if I manage to create Docker container for one AngularJS app today.
Apr 21 10:22:26 <codingquark>	What utilities do I learn to efficiently search through files within emacs?
Apr 21 10:22:44 <codingquark>	Or should I not do that in emacs and learn awk/grep/etc?
Apr 21 10:24:36 <miskatonic>	grep sed awk may be used in emacs M-x shell
Apr 21 10:26:27 <twb>	codingquark: I use M-x grep
Apr 21 10:26:41 <twb>	codingquark: which can take arbitrary commands, e.g. find ... -exec grep ...
Apr 21 10:26:49 <codingquark>	twb: cool!
Apr 21 10:26:49 <twb>	codingquark: or what I use 99% of the time, which is git grep
Apr 21 10:27:07 <codingquark>	Need to look at that too
Apr 21 10:27:09 <twb>	Also it's not obvious, but M-x grep understands git grep -0 -nH
Apr 21 10:27:24 <codingquark>	I have heard good things about git grep
Apr 21 10:27:29 <twb>	What everybody else seems to use is ctags or LSP
Apr 21 10:27:47 <twb>	or one of those GHASTLY replacements for GNU grep written in fucking go
Apr 21 10:28:12 <twb>	Most of which are "it's faster" just because different defaults, not because they actually did groundbreaking research
Apr 21 10:28:24 <codingquark>	For code navigation, I have setup tools for the languages I use often.
Apr 21 10:28:53 <codingquark>	But I want to search through notes which are org-mode files. And they may not necessarily be tagged.

Apr 21 11:14:51 *	Channel #emacs url: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel
Apr 21 12:01:10 <dustfinger>	My emacs buffers have termcap/terminfo issues. For example, if I open /usr/share/emacs/26.3/etc/TERMs, then just above the copyright I see a ^L. I would like to resolve this issue. I run exwm which I start from xterm after signing in at the commandline with the command startx. At the time of launch $TERM=linux. The value of term-termcap-format is https://termbin.com/ejh1. My knowledge about proper configuration of terminfo is low at the
Apr 21 12:01:10 <dustfinger>	moment. I am reasearching this, but I am feeling lost. If anyone has any ideas that might help, please let me know, I would greatly appreciate your time and advice.
Apr 21 12:07:18 <dustfinger>	hmm, if I run (getenv "TERM") the rsult is dumb. That is probably the issue. I wonder why it ends up being dumb when it is linux at launch?
Apr 21 12:07:50 <lesshaste>	I want to replace "[ " with "[". I tried esc-x replace string but it doesn't seem to find any instances of "[ "
Apr 21 12:08:02 <lesshaste>	do I need to escape it somehow?
Apr 21 12:08:33 <dustfinger>	OKay, I am going to make some changes so I will be offline momentarily because I will need to restart exwm. 
Apr 21 12:19:10 <knobo>	Can I run a suffix-command like magit-push-current-to-pushremote directly from lisp? something like: (magit-push-current-to-pushremote)
Apr 21 12:21:15 <bremner>	you might need to provide some arguments for it to work how you expect, but yes
Apr 21 12:27:41 <knobo>	How would I create a command that opens the forge pr currnet branch is involved in?
Apr 21 12:28:25 <knobo>	I mean open the pr in the browser on for example github, if that's where the pr is located.
Apr 21 12:29:49 <bremner>	that escalated quickly.
Apr 21 12:35:47 <knobo>	Yes it did :)
Apr 21 12:36:07 <knobo>	Anyway, thank you for the suffix-command input.
Apr 21 12:38:58 <bremner>	where does "suffix-command" come from? 
Apr 21 12:39:51 <giorgian>	Hi. How can I disable transparent scrollbars?
Apr 21 12:42:59 <bremner>	I guess the magit authors came up with the term suffix-command
Apr 21 12:43:23 <bremner>	giorgian: you could run the same version of emacs and same OS as me. Then you would not have transparent scrollbars.
Apr 21 12:43:41 <bremner>	i.e. you'll need to give more details to get help
Apr 21 12:45:48 <hodapp>	hmm. I stumbled into the issue that I have 4x4 transform matrices, and a series of multiplications like A1 * M1^i * A2 * M2^i * A3 * ... and am trying to figure out if this can be expressed as B * C^i because I am mostly certain it can but don't know how to find B & C
Apr 21 12:45:48 <bremner>	rudybot: how about a nice game of thermonuclear war?
Apr 21 12:46:02 <rudybot>	bremner: Howabout a nice game of Global Thermonuclear War?
Apr 21 12:46:09 <fledermaus>	ruh roh.
Apr 21 12:46:19 <fledermaus>	say no. NO.
Apr 21 12:46:28 <roadie>	brothers in arms - just do it
Apr 21 12:46:54 <bremner>	people say they want all the virus gone, but they're not willing to do what it takes...
Apr 21 12:49:04 <giorgian>	bremner: I'm still running the mituharu version of emacs mac port installed by homebrew cask, https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac - haven't yet studied how to build it myself
Apr 21 12:50:26 <holomorph>	hodapp: like quaternion kinda transforms?
Apr 21 12:50:58 <hodapp>	holomorph: not sure if I could express these as quaternions or not
Apr 21 12:51:08 <hodapp>	it involves more than rotations
Apr 21 12:53:15 <holomorph>	ah
Apr 21 12:54:48 <Amy1>	How to move one chapter from file1.org to file2.org? Because there are some link path "file://xx.jpg" in the chapter.
Apr 21 12:55:22 <bremner>	Amy1: is file2.org in a different directory?
Apr 21 12:55:35 <Amy1>	yes
Apr 21 12:55:59 <bremner>	so I guess you need to move the jpg files as well? Or link them if you need them in both places
Apr 21 12:56:10 <Amy1>	all
Apr 21 12:56:17 <Amy1>	link and images
Apr 21 12:58:55 <giorgian>	The problem is not that scrollbars are transparent, it's that they do transparency wrong, they show ghost text: https://0x0.st/i1Gg.png
Apr 21 12:59:46 <Amy1>	bremner: ??
Apr 21 12:59:46 <fsbot>	Highly likely
Apr 21 13:02:51 <sonjah>	hi how can i pass a line to a shell command or a script in emacs?
Apr 21 13:03:43 <bremner>	Amy1: gotta run. Try explaining a bit more what is blocking you. I think I didn't understand the problem yet
Apr 21 13:07:35 <hodapp>	it looks like, yet again, the answer I need is "eigendecomposition"
Apr 21 13:07:37 <hodapp>	or something
Apr 21 13:10:14 <Amy1>	For example, the  chapter in file1.org has file:images/1.jpg, file2.org also has file:images/1.jpg in it's local dir. If move the chapter in file1.org into file2.org, I should cut 1.jpg to file2.org's images dir and rename a not conflict name in file2.org, and also modify the file name in the chapter.
Apr 21 13:31:20 <dustfinger>	I am back, When emacs opens a plain text buffer in fundemental mode, what reasons would it display control characters? If I open /usr/share/emacs.26.3/TERMS I see a ^L immediately above the COPYING PERMISSIONS section. I see the same character in *Help* when looking at mode information. What might be causing this issue?
Apr 21 13:33:39 <giorgian>	dustfinger: I suspect the ^L is actually there. It is used to divide files in sections, you can see it in a lot of .el files
Apr 21 13:34:20 <wasamasa>	Amy1: sounds like you've got lots of busywork to do
Apr 21 13:34:30 <wasamasa>	Amy1: unless you can figure out some complicated regex
Apr 21 13:35:07 <siraben>	building emacs from source on ARM, what package provides makeinfo?
Apr 21 13:35:30 <giorgian>	dustfinger: I confirm, it is in my TERMS too and I can see it with less
Apr 21 13:36:40 <dustfinger>	giorgian: we both might have an issue then. My understanding is that ^L is the form feed character. I don't think we would see that character normally if our terminfo was set correctly. Unless I am mistaken?
Apr 21 13:37:19 <dustfinger>	I have seen other control characters in other emails help buffers before, but I can't find an example at the moment.
Apr 21 13:38:32 <wgreenhouse>	dustfinger: emacs normally displays that character, and can make use of it for navigation. see e.g. ,,df narrow-to-page
Apr 21 13:38:32 <fsbot>	narrow-to-page is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘page.el’.
Apr 21 13:38:32 <fsbot>	It is bound to C-x n p.
Apr 21 13:38:32 <fsbot>	(narrow-to-page &optional ARG)
Apr 21 13:38:32 <fsbot>	Make text outside current page invisible. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 21 13:38:39 <wgreenhouse>	,,df next-page
Apr 21 13:38:39 <fsbot>	Oh sh**!  [df] No function or variable found matching next-page or fs-next-page. (My emacs-version: 26.1)
Apr 21 13:38:55 <wgreenhouse>	,,dk C-x ]
Apr 21 13:39:13 <fsbot>	forward-page is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘page.el’.
Apr 21 13:39:15 <fsbot>	It is bound to C-x ].
Apr 21 13:39:17 <fsbot>	(forward-page &optional COUNT)
Apr 21 13:39:19 <fsbot>	Move forward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go back if negative. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 21 13:39:35 <dustfinger>	giorgian: Mostly, I don't see control charcters, but sometimes I do. Also, when I connect to a device over serial term, then run a ncurses UI, such as nmtui, I also see control characters. In the cause of nmtui over serial-term the control characters are more problematic, mainly because there are more of them and It irritates me that they are there :-P 
Apr 21 13:39:38 <wgreenhouse>	dustfinger: so, not a terminfo problem--normal emacs behavior
Apr 21 13:40:01 <wgreenhouse>	the visible ^L at least
Apr 21 13:40:07 <giorgian>	dustfinger: I don't understand, why shouldn't we see ^L if it's there? cat doesn't show it, but less does. Emacs uses it to delimit "pages", C-x [ and C-x ] from ^L to ^L
Apr 21 13:40:35 <siraben>	can I build emacs without texinfo?
Apr 21 13:41:19 <wgreenhouse>	siraben: you won't be able to compile the info manuals so you'll have to skip that step. Otherwise, yes
Apr 21 13:41:40 <siraben>	wgreenhouse:  How do I specify so in the build?

Apr 21 13:52:47 <dustfinger>	Okay, so is that determined by the majore mode, or emacs itself?
Apr 21 13:53:48 <dustfinger>	giorgian: ^L is the form-feed character - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character. It is widely used, not just emacs.
Apr 21 13:53:59 <wgreenhouse>	dustfinger: emacs itself (though there are minor modes which replace it with another character for display, or draw a horizontal line to show the page break)
Apr 21 13:55:34 <dustfinger>	I am now wondering if the ^L exists above the copy right notice in /usr/share/emacs/2.6.3/TERMS so that the copy right is printed on its own page.

Apr 21 18:14:49 <paluche>	I'd like to override a dired binding only for a specific dired buffer. Is this possible?
Apr 21 18:15:32 <wasamasa>	this is what local-set-key is designed for
Apr 21 18:15:45 <wasamasa>	use it in a hook checking the buffer for whatever condition
Apr 21 18:15:58 <paluche>	but "The binding goes in the current buffer’s local map, which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode."
Apr 21 18:16:27 <bpalmer>	paluche: create a new key map which has as its parent the current active keymap
Apr 21 18:16:34 <bpalmer>	paluche: then local set key into that new keymap
Apr 21 18:17:40 <bpalmer>	(use-local-map (let ((m (make-sparse-keymap))) (set-keymap-parent m (current-local-map)) (define-key m (kbd "...") ...) m))  or so
Apr 21 18:17:52 <paluche>	thanks!
Apr 21 18:18:21 <wasamasa>	wow, that's a bit more involved than I've hoped for
Apr 21 18:18:36 <wasamasa>	this leaves the question, just what exactly is `local-set-key' even good for?
Apr 21 18:18:45 <bpalmer>	mode specific bindings
Apr 21 18:18:52 <wasamasa>	but you can do that without it just fine
Apr 21 18:19:02 <wasamasa>	modify the mode's map
Apr 21 18:19:09 <bpalmer>	ah, but local-set-key is interactive
Apr 21 18:19:19 <wasamasa>	a weak reason, but I'll take it
Apr 21 18:19:37 <paluche>	huh, so it is
Apr 21 18:19:40 <kiraslaugh>	hey everyone, just wondering if we can discuss doom emacs here? I normally run emacs but decided to give doom a try.
Apr 21 18:19:56 <wasamasa>	don't expect support for it
Apr 21 18:20:09 <bpalmer>	kiraslaugh: sure, you can discuss it, but there may not be many other people around who know anything about it.
Apr 21 18:21:23 <kiraslaugh>	yeah it seems kind of odd. After using emacs configuration for doom seems really weird. 
Apr 21 18:22:35 <cvandusen>	maybe they misnamed it. 
Apr 21 18:22:56 <wgreenhouse>	that's the one whose primary support channel is on discord, right?
Apr 21 18:23:04 <bpalmer>	"the one"
Apr 21 18:23:06 <kiraslaugh>	I think so
Apr 21 18:23:11 <bpalmer>	Oh, no, spacemacs uses gitter
Apr 21 18:23:53 <bpalmer>	Someday I may have to try discord, I guess.
Apr 21 18:24:48 <ldlework>	bpalmer: it's the best of kinds of things
Apr 21 18:25:17 <ldlework>	companies and stuff aside, it is just the easiest to admin, be a user of, etc
Apr 21 18:25:20 <ldlework>	imo ofc
Apr 21 18:25:36 <ldlework>	those kinds of things*
Apr 21 18:27:28 <wgreenhouse>	I have odd feelings about how hip emacs seems to be atm
Apr 21 18:27:53 <bpalmer>	rudybot: I hear it's hip to be square.
Apr 21 18:27:54 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Students, teachers, the elder, the young, the hip, and the square...
Apr 21 18:28:25 <wgreenhouse>	doom emacs, castlemacs, spacemacs all seem to be doing an emacs-as-lifestyle kind of thing
Apr 21 18:29:26 <ldlework>	i don't use any of those, and in a way, i treat emacs as a generalized app platform too
Apr 21 18:29:32 <ldlework>	i'm not exactly sure what's meant by lifestyle
Apr 21 18:29:43 <bpalmer>	I hadn't run into castlemacs yet
Apr 21 18:30:04 <wgreenhouse>	castlemacs markets to mac users in much the same way as spacemacs and doomemacs target vim users
Apr 21 18:30:05 <bpalmer>	I wonder how much of the current popularity is the boom in org

Apr 21 20:41:43 <adgtl>	74% taken by dimmer functions? Can someone here confirm the culprit?
Apr 21 20:45:21 <adgtl>	https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el/issues/45
Apr 21 20:45:55 <bremner>	maybe fix the typo in the issue title?
Apr 21 20:46:09 <bremner>	to be fair, almost dinner type here
Apr 21 20:46:10 <miskatonic>	fsbot: dimmer
Apr 21 20:46:11 <fsbot>	You will obey or molten silver will be poured into your ears.
Apr 21 20:47:26 <adgtl>	bremner thanks :D
Apr 21 20:48:25 <adgtl>	bremner bpalmer dale Could you confirm profiler report captures the bug perfectly? 
Apr 21 20:48:37 <wgreenhouse>	dinner-mode is presumably an emacs implementation of http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/
Apr 21 20:48:50 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 21 20:48:56 <miskatonic>	fsbot: dinner-mode
Apr 21 20:48:58 <fsbot>	I invented skydiving in 1989!
Apr 21 20:49:14 <wasamasa>	speaking of such domains, I discovered https://thebestmotherfucking.website/ today
Apr 21 20:49:20 <wasamasa>	and I borrowed some colors
Apr 21 20:50:35 <adgtl>	Fast emacs is whole different world than slow Emacs
Apr 21 20:51:08 <adgtl>	I used Atom editor for implementing some features for my client..I kept Emacs aside as I wanted to that fast.. 
Apr 21 20:51:26 <adgtl>	Now back to fast Emacs experience.. great that I hanged out in #emacs here..
Apr 21 20:51:37 <adgtl>	I was just suffering the issue
Apr 21 20:51:57 <adgtl>	I thought may be macOS catalina bug or Emacs build issue
Apr 21 20:52:00 <dale>	adgtl: Well, I definitely see dimmer taking up a bunch of CPU time there.  It's weird that it seems to be firing on focus out rather than in.  If you ⌘⇥ away from Emacs, but stay away from Emacs for like thirty seconds, then switch back to Emacs, is the switch back immediate?
Apr 21 20:52:39 <adgtl>	dale every alternate switch is faster and slower
Apr 21 20:52:53 <noobly>	anyone how to input a latex formula and graph it? I've got calc open with the latex formula, and I try inputting the interval [0, 4], but I can't get it to work
Apr 21 20:52:55 <adgtl>	dale I have removed that package and I am now with fast emacs experience
Apr 21 20:53:12 <miskatonic>	Atom is only suited for mouse-lovers, so no option
Apr 21 20:53:28 <bremner>	we don't judge rodentsexuals here
Apr 21 20:53:34 <bremner>	ok, maybe a little
Apr 21 20:53:44 <wgreenhouse>	there's a monty python sketch about mouse parties
Apr 21 20:53:57 <bremner>	rudybot: when you said you were a furry, I thought that involved costumes
Apr 21 20:54:08 <rudybot>	bremner: and if it's hong kong, people dressed in cute furry costumes (optionally with backpacks) will no doubt be easy to find
Apr 21 20:54:32 <adgtl>	miskatonic Atom helped me to be fast today to deliver something to my client 
Apr 21 20:54:41 <adgtl>	just because Dimmer was making me slow
Apr 21 20:54:53 <adgtl>	Dimmer is Coronavirus of Emacs
Apr 21 20:55:24 <adgtl>	This bug is there for like a month+ ..  I have reinstalled Emacs and deleted config a lot last few weeks.
Apr 21 20:55:33 <adgtl>	This bug persisted due to Dimmer package.
Apr 21 20:55:50 <dale>	Strangely, the author of dimmer.el also seems to be on macOS.
Apr 21 20:56:22 <dale>	Well, it isn't strange that he is on macOS.  It is strange that macOS would have such a severe bug but he wouldn't notice it.  Assuming he uses his own library.
Apr 21 20:57:17 <ryouma>	the author of the package seems at cursory glance to mistake window for buffer
Apr 21 20:57:21 <adgtl>	dale he is suffering already for sure.
Apr 21 20:57:27 <adgtl>	and he doesn't know the reason
Apr 21 20:57:54 <adgtl>	dale Please add comments to that issue please.. make him aware that he is sleeping.
Apr 21 20:58:08 <ryouma>	active buffers frmo a user perspective are really active windwos right?
Apr 21 20:59:02 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: makes me wonder how it handles clone-indirect-buffer and friends
Apr 21 20:59:13 <adgtl>	So we M-x profiler-start  .. but we don't M-x profiler-stop?
Apr 21 20:59:19 <miskatonic>	dimmer is probably only for GUI emacs, nor for -nw
Apr 21 20:59:26 <adgtl>	we directly M-x profiler-report ??
Apr 21 20:59:26 <fsbot>	It is certain!
Apr 21 20:59:37 <ryouma>	wgreenhouse: elaborate?
Apr 21 20:59:39 <dale>	adgtl: IIRC you do need to profiler-stop *after* you profiler-report.
Apr 21 20:59:41 <wgreenhouse>	adgtl: you can also profiler-stop
Apr 21 20:59:58 <adgtl>	dale okay
Apr 21 20:59:58 <wgreenhouse>	right, profiler is still running right now otherwise
Apr 21 21:01:00 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: just contemplating the insanity if they somehow really do mean buffer and not window
Apr 21 21:02:43 <adgtl>	Anyone uses magit? I recently started it to resolve conflicts.. but I don't like coloring .. anyone know how to configure better coloring?
Apr 21 21:02:50 <dale>	adgtl: FWIW just did a clean install of dimmer into Emacs 26.3 NeXTStep port on macOS 10.14, and I get no problems switching back and forth with dimmer, so it probably takes more than just dimmer to reproduce.
Apr 21 21:03:33 <adgtl>	dale ah.. but profiler captured that bug right?
Apr 21 21:03:43 <dale>	adgtl: I don't think there is any bug?
Apr 21 21:04:25 <adgtl>	dale what? then how it fixed it for me.
Apr 21 21:05:09 <nikitamog>	adgtl: Font lock controls color schemes iirc.
Apr 21 21:05:45 <dale>	adgtl: dimmer is only like 2% of CPU time according to profiler here.
Apr 21 21:05:49 <adgtl>	https://www.loom.com/share/419abfa158cb45f7a1a6e5e8c8a30753
Apr 21 21:05:57 <adgtl>	Without dimmer, that's the experience
Apr 21 21:06:07 <adgtl>	fast like antman
Apr 21 21:06:11 <dale>	adgtl: So I think perhaps you're either experiencing a problem with your build, or else bad interaction between dimmer and some other package(s).  You could bisect your configuration to try and figure it out.
Apr 21 21:06:36 <dale>	adgtl: But if you don't need dimmer and want to move on, seems like you can now.
Apr 21 21:06:51 <adgtl>	dale I changed multiple builds from 26.2 to 27 to 28
Apr 21 21:06:51 <dale>	adgtl: I would bet the author will not be able to fix the bug because he can't reproduce it, though.
Apr 21 21:06:53 <adgtl>	and deleted my config 
Apr 21 21:06:59 <adgtl>	but issue was there.
Apr 21 21:07:08 <dale>	adgtl: So you're saying an Emacs config that has *only* dimmer exhibits this problem?
Apr 21 21:07:24 <adgtl>	dale not sure
Apr 21 21:07:49 <nikitamog>	dimmer looks cool. I feel that the modeline suffices but the aesthetic is nice.
Apr 21 21:07:56 <adgtl>	but as I have put my use-package config for dimmer, I think folks should be able to reproduce problem
Apr 21 21:08:10 <adgtl>	dale you saw that with previous loom share, there was issue
Apr 21 21:08:25 <dale>	adgtl: Oh, I definitely saw it.
Apr 21 21:08:26 <adgtl>	after removing dimmer, the issue is gone and I have shown that in loom
Apr 21 21:08:35 <adgtl>	let me link both loom files to GitHub issue as well
Apr 21 21:09:03 <beauty>	4:04 AM <Amy1> will the attachments also move into file2.org path's attachment'dir?
Apr 21 21:09:26 <miskatonic>	sp just dispose permanently with dimmer and thinks will be great
Apr 21 21:09:33 <adgtl>	Folks you won't realized how much I have suffered whole month because of dimmer
Apr 21 21:09:34 <grym>	technomancy: i am now at a point in my life where binding C-x 5 0 to a keyboard macro seems like a good way to spend my time 
Apr 21 21:09:40 <adgtl>	Enormous pain it was
Apr 21 21:10:13 <adgtl>	it's mental psycological pain kind of.. I didn't stop working and kept using Emacs until today .. I need to do something quicker and I used Atom editor
Apr 21 21:10:31 <adgtl>	that's why I am here today in #emacs because I felt weird to use Atom and it worked fast
Apr 21 21:10:38 <grym>	adgtl: try sublime :D 
Apr 21 21:11:06 <technomancy>	grym: there's still hope for you
Apr 21 21:11:15 <grym>	technomancy: it is very handy! 
Apr 21 21:11:19 <grym>	har har
Apr 21 21:11:39 <adgtl>	grym I love Emacs.. but only fast emacs.. Can't handle slow Emacs'
Apr 21 21:11:43 <grym>	technomancy: if you haven't been following along i've also changed window managers so this keyboard's getting a workout 
Apr 21 21:11:51 <grym>	adgtl: slow bad. 
Apr 21 21:13:05 <technomancy>	grym: an atreus?
Apr 21 21:13:29 <grym>	technomancy: ergodox-ez 
Apr 21 21:13:34 <technomancy>	ah gotcha
Apr 21 21:13:34 <lampilelo>	adgtl: next time don't wait a month, just test with "emacs -q" and then bisect your config if the problem is gone without your init file
Apr 21 21:13:35 <adgtl>	Anyone using Slow emacs here?
Apr 21 21:13:45 <ryouma>	is that like slow food?
Apr 21 21:13:50 <adgtl>	I think there should be a consultancy on Emacs to make it fast
Apr 21 21:13:57 <adgtl>	I would charge $200 per hour
Apr 21 21:14:06 <adgtl>	I will just use emacs profiler
Apr 21 21:14:07 <ryouma>	,slow
Apr 21 21:14:08 <ecbrown>	they formed a company called sublime text

Apr 21 21:14:32 <grym>	technomancy: real similar approach.  did you see the survivalist raspi build that is very qmk-madness in a pelican case
Apr 21 21:14:33 <adgtl>	Direct message me if you want to join me for fast emacs consultancy
Apr 21 21:14:38 <cvandusen>	I'm slow so emacs feels just right to me 
Apr 21 21:14:40 <adgtl>	I am serious for the night
Apr 21 21:15:03 <adgtl>	Anyway thanks folks
Apr 21 21:15:04 <bremner>	I bet you say that to all the people you meet in the bar
Apr 21 21:15:16 <spikemaster>	i've finally moved from melpa packages to 100% git submodules. Init performance grealy improved after removing (package-initialize). Full featured pan-language IDE laods in 0.3 sec.
Apr 21 21:15:23 <technomancy>	grym: yeah, I love the connectors they put on the front panel
Apr 21 21:15:45 <technomancy>	rudybot: xlr jacks; so hot right now
Apr 21 21:15:46 <rudybot>	technomancy: balanced network audio wall jacks (you just run ethernet to it and plug-in xlr)
Apr 21 21:15:55 <grym>	technomancy: just like EE lab back in the day 
Apr 21 21:16:29 <jlf>	cvandusen: better latent than never, i always say
Apr 21 21:16:46 <grym>	technomancy: i don't need that level of stuff in my life but i'd love to have a little mech board + small touchscreen that i could use to fiddle with normally-headless raspis 
Apr 21 21:16:52 <grym>	like my pi-hole 
Apr 21 21:16:59 <wgreenhouse>	grym: link pls
Apr 21 21:17:05 <wgreenhouse>	I love cyberdeck-ish things
Apr 21 21:17:14 <cvandusen>	rolling on the floor lagging 
Apr 21 21:17:21 <ryouma>	spikemaster: can you describe your submodules?  do you manually get from github?  and then do git voodoo to link them to whatever?
Apr 21 21:17:41 <grym>	wgreenhouse: this is like a cyberbrick, but.. https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit  
Apr 21 21:17:55 <grym>	wgreenhouse: i want a Hackers-style rattlecanned deck :) 
Apr 21 21:18:21 <spikemaster>	i forked everything under my own github account.  Then added submodules to my forks. This allows me to contribute personal bikeshedding mods to myself and store them in github.
Apr 21 21:19:42 <spikemaster>	manually fork each.  manually run git submodule add https://github/somepack
Apr 21 21:19:45 <ryouma>	then you git clone your github and you are ready to go?
Apr 21 21:20:04 <grym>	wgreenhouse: i think the little wire and shrinkwrap handle is brilliant 
Apr 21 21:20:19 <dale>	I hate Squarespace sites because they have like six domains I have to white list for every site in uBlock medium mode.
Apr 21 21:20:24 <ryouma>	when will the githubapocalypse occur?
Apr 21 21:20:33 <spikemaster>	ryouma: yes. git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SOME-EMACS.F
Apr 21 21:20:50 <spikemaster>	and i can update submodules with git submodule update --init --recursive
Apr 21 21:20:56 <ldlework>	spikemaster: how do you get updates?
Apr 21 21:21:04 <ryouma>	are submodules dependencies on the packages they are in?  do they cow?
Apr 21 21:21:21 <spikemaster>	i have 2 remotes for each submodule.  my personal fork, and the upstream. manually merge in changes form upstream, push to my fork
Apr 21 21:21:32 <ldlework>	what if the package isn't maintained on git?
Apr 21 21:21:37 <technomancy>	grym: the problem is that all the pi-based builds are really impractical as none of them support passthru charging
Apr 21 21:21:50 <spikemaster>	i force it to exist in git, by forking (not neccsarily the github fork feature)
Apr 21 21:21:51 <technomancy>	so it's like ... you can use it until the battery runs out, then you have to power it down just in order to charge =(
Apr 21 21:21:58 <ldlework>	seems like manually merging in changes is a lot of work, and largely the point of a package repository
Apr 21 21:22:13 <technomancy>	grym: (unless it's a pi zero)
Apr 21 21:22:23 <ldlework>	spikemaster: have you seen straight.el?
Apr 21 21:22:46 <spikemaster>	i have taken a look at it, but it's more stuff to learn. I *want* to selectivly update packages 1 at a time.
Apr 21 21:23:00 <ldlework>	spikemaster: it does largely what you're doing, for you
Apr 21 21:23:05 <ldlework>	you point use-package at git repos
Apr 21 21:23:18 <ldlework>	on first load, it clones all of them into ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/
Apr 21 21:23:18 <grym>	technomancy: yeah, he had to wire in a battery
Apr 21 21:23:33 <spikemaster>	i'm basically using git only, with some minimal helper functions to do things like loop through the submoduels and byte-compile, etc.
Apr 21 21:23:39 <ldlework>	spikemaster: it even has a feature for you to maintain an official upstream, and development switch
Apr 21 21:23:54 <wgreenhouse>	grym: I'm amused by the inclusion of a network switch that's much beefier than the pi itself can make use of. I love it.
Apr 21 21:24:16 <technomancy>	grym: I had an idea to build a pi zero into a keyboard with no display, and have it tmate into another machine plugged into a big TV
Apr 21 21:24:31 <wgreenhouse>	grym: the otoh, the pi4 can use PoE, so alternate power supply, or using the pi as a router, I guess
Apr 21 21:24:42 <spikemaster>	i'm sure straight is better thought out for package management. But i still to learn and discover it's features. I already know how to use git features.
Apr 21 21:25:03 <spikemaster>	not obfuscation on what's going on.
Apr 21 21:25:07 <ldlework>	it's basically just adding a new keyword to use-package
Apr 21 21:25:16 <ldlework>	and then doing what you're doing, cloining packages from git
Apr 21 21:25:18 *	ldlework shrugs
Apr 21 21:25:26 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: but the pi 4 takes like double the current of the pi 2
Apr 21 21:25:34 <technomancy>	more than double, I think
Apr 21 21:26:23 <ldlework>	(use-package helpful :straight (helpful :type git :host github :repo "Wilfred/helpful"))
Apr 21 21:27:07 <spikemaster>	ldlework: can straight deal wiht the upstream using mecurial, but my fork using github?
Apr 21 21:27:16 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: almost double the 2, or marginally more than the 3, yeah. https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/power/README.md
Apr 21 21:27:38 <wgreenhouse>	I still have a 3, so the onboard usb hub of the Motorola Lapdock is enough to keep it running comfortably
Apr 21 21:27:45 <wgreenhouse>	would not be if I swapped it out for a 4
Apr 21 21:28:13 <adgtl>	okay I see a comment from author - https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el/issues/45 dale grym bremner lampilelo 
Apr 21 21:28:19 <ldlework>	spikemaster: it just does git afaik
Apr 21 21:28:30 <ryouma>	technomancy: using tv as monitor?
Apr 21 21:29:25 <spikemaster>	i just use git too. manually handle any diffs for rando packages not using git. But those are so few it's not an issue to download and  diff when needed.
Apr 21 21:30:07 <ldlework>	right if you're already maintaining git forks of things which are not in git, then it's still applicable 
Apr 21 21:30:20 <grym>	technomancy: i want to build "the user interface bit" of a pi into a keyboard case, kind of the opposite of your idea. 
Apr 21 21:30:45 <grym>	but i have some headless pis littering the place and sometimes they don't reboot cleanly when an idiot unplugs them from the kitchen
Apr 21 21:30:52 <ryouma>	i just use git with as few features as possible, manually cloned, manually updated
Apr 21 21:30:54 <Cairn[m]>	grym: Like a cyberdeck?
Apr 21 21:31:01 <grym>	Cairn[m]: yes.  scroll up :D 
Apr 21 21:31:38 <Cairn[m]>	Oh, haha! Excuse me.
Apr 21 21:31:55 <Cairn[m]>	You totally should. They're awesome projects.
Apr 21 21:32:27 <spikemaster>	ryouma: do you use git submodules in your .emacs.d?  or do you clone outside your emacs config?
Apr 21 21:32:52 <lampilelo>	grym: you keep idiots at home?
Apr 21 21:34:35 <grym>	lampilelo: ah, at work.  i wrote a little computer vision "is the sink dirty? shitpost about it on slack" thing and bolted a raspi zero above the break room counter
Apr 21 21:34:36 <technomancy>	lampilelo: well, where else to keep them?
Apr 21 21:34:51 <ryouma>	spikemaster: git submodules crosses my threshold of git features that could cause me to have git problems.  but i am curious nonetheless.  i don't use .emacs.d because taht is for emacs.
Apr 21 21:34:59 <lampilelo>	technomancy: in the barn, of course
Apr 21 21:35:10 <technomancy>	lampilelo: ah of course
Apr 21 21:35:36 <grym>	ryouma: sub{modules,trees} are a giant pain.  worktrees apparently doesn't suck, but i've never used it and isn't germane here 
Apr 21 21:35:58 <ryouma>	i am intimidated enough by merges...
Apr 21 21:36:35 <grym>	merges ceased to scare me years ago 
Apr 21 21:36:45 <grym>	they were hairy in svn 
Apr 21 21:36:56 <adgtl>	Here is profile report https://gist.github.com/anildigital/cbe37f9e64604f4e994ba774e6b2593f after setting (setq dimmer-watch-frame-focus-events nil) for dimmer-mode
Apr 21 21:37:03 <spikemaster>	i'm a git beginner sort of. I had to look up online how to make the submodules, delete them, etc. I think extermanl git repos is just as valid. It's just a sort of neat having everythign your emacs config depends on insdide the same folder.
Apr 21 21:37:22 <adgtl>	dimmer went to 6% from 74%
Apr 21 21:37:48 <ryouma>	profiling is great
Apr 21 21:37:56 <grym>	spikemaster: i'm with ldlework here; straight's totally-independent-git-clones is a simpler mental model for me to reason about 
Apr 21 21:38:00 <grym>	by about an order 
Apr 21 21:38:27 <ldlework>	not to mention it integrates with use-package
Apr 21 21:38:42 <ldlework>	which lets you treat your package configuration and other details nicely, in a regular way
Apr 21 21:39:04 <grym>	that is the other secret sauce, yes
Apr 21 21:39:09 <grym>	ldlework: still using nougaty things? 
Apr 21 21:39:11 <ldlework>	you can update the packages, and switch to your fork, with commands available within emacs too
Apr 21 21:39:21 <ldlework>	grym: nah, abandoned it, just have my own init now
Apr 21 21:39:21 <ryouma>	i don't get the point of use-package
Apr 21 21:39:34 <ryouma>	(unpopular opinion)
Apr 21 21:39:38 <grym>	ldlework: i still like the idea, but i've drifted a bit 
Apr 21 21:39:42 <ldlework>	ryouma: well i mentioned a couple
Apr 21 21:40:02 <ldlework>	grym: i mean i still build from org, but just one org-file now
Apr 21 21:40:14 <ldlework>	i still like the idea too, but it needs critical mass
Apr 21 21:40:37 <grym>	ldlework: yeah, and #+INCLUDE is hard to navigate/reason about
Apr 21 21:40:52 <grym>	that and getting the :sublevels right is the only hiccup that i've noticed 
Apr 21 21:40:52 <technomancy>	ryouma: same
Apr 21 21:41:02 <ldlework>	grym: yeah it's not perfect
Apr 21 21:41:16 <ryouma>	ldlework: well if straight is useful then havintg use-pacakge use it soudns ueful, but then so would usign a straight identifier?
Apr 21 21:41:18 <spikemaster>	i never got into use-package. More stuff to learn, but i already knew how to set up autoloads. And use with-eval-after-load for sleeping code.
Apr 21 21:41:25 <grym>	ldlework: useful enough to not change though! 
Apr 21 21:41:38 <grym>	either that or i'm laazy 
Apr 21 21:41:58 <ldlework>	grym: i had to move away because i was mostly burned by wasting a bunch of time on it
Apr 21 21:42:18 <lampilelo>	spikemaster: use-package lets you do that stuff with less code, that's the point of it
Apr 21 21:42:39 <ldlework>	yeah i was just typing out "i'm not sure why knowing how to do it obviates the value of not having to do it."
Apr 21 21:43:05 <grym>	spikemaster: the opposite of Don't Repeat Yourself is We Enjoy Typing 
Apr 21 21:43:37 <ldlework>	the regularity is good too
Apr 21 21:43:47 <ryouma>	i am big on dry but for some reason with-eval-after-load is perspicuous to me (and legacy)
Apr 21 21:43:53 <spikemaster>	what if you have eval-after-load in several places?   like  if several  helper packages affected a language-mode, you might put each eval-after-load near that helper packages config.
Apr 21 21:43:59 <adgtl>	Weird issue with counsel-M-x.. it should show the typed command first https://i.imgur.com/IG0Lmnx.png
Apr 21 21:43:59 <ldlework>	I think use-package is going to be official in emacs
Apr 21 21:44:06 <adgtl>	it shows at the center
Apr 21 21:44:19 <ldlework>	I remember reading about john asking for copyright signatures or whatever it is to be emacs contributors
Apr 21 21:44:24 <ldlework>	from people who contributed to use-package
Apr 21 21:44:46 <spikemaster>	use-package sort of wants you to group everything in 1 palce for that package right?  But some packages are a neboulus graph that ineract with each other like a hippy colony
Apr 21 21:44:50 <xristos>	a good reason not to go with use-package is that it adds a layer of obfuscation, that (sometimes) may prove to be a problem
Apr 21 21:45:05 <ldlework>	spikemaster: just because you are using use-package doesn't mean you can't write any other lisp code
Apr 21 21:45:13 <grym>	xristos: you say obfuscation i say encapsulation
Apr 21 21:45:16 <xristos>	most folks probably don't need to worry about it
Apr 21 21:45:24 <xristos>	but i don't use it because i want maximum control
Apr 21 21:45:25 <lampilelo>	adgtl: i have the same problem since updating my packages 2 days ago, i guess bug confirmed
Apr 21 21:45:33 <ldlework>	yeah it's a fairly simple package that does a thing written by a prolific package author
Apr 21 21:45:34 <ldlework>	seems ok
Apr 21 21:45:56 <adgtl>	lampilelo ah okay.. any quick solution?
Apr 21 21:45:57 <johnw>	you can always expand the use-package macro
Apr 21 21:46:01 <xristos>	it's fine for most people
Apr 21 21:46:10 <xristos>	i like johnw's work ;p
Apr 21 21:46:26 <xristos>	it's just not fine for me
Apr 21 21:46:32 <lampilelo>	adgtl: i didn't try to fix it yet, so no, do you have flx or smex maybe?
Apr 21 21:46:50 <ldlework>	johnw: is use-package going into emacs?
Apr 21 21:47:04 <lampilelo>	adgtl: because it might not be an ivy/counsel issue by itself
Apr 21 21:47:12 <johnw>	no reason not to, but I just haven't been arsed to do the background research
Apr 21 21:47:28 <johnw>	this is a task I'd love to just give over to someone else
Apr 21 21:47:30 <johnw>	because it doesn't need me
Apr 21 21:47:39 <wasamasa>	it would be neat if the github issue had checkmarks for all people that did assignments so far
Apr 21 21:47:59 <miskatonic>	first dimmer, than use-package ... who is behind that conspiracy to destroy emacs? 
Apr 21 21:47:59 <johnw>	you can make an issue ticket with checkboxes at least
Apr 21 21:48:23 <adgtl>	ldlework it is already
Apr 21 21:48:25 <wasamasa>	I'm speaking of this one: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/282
Apr 21 21:48:30 <ldlework>	adgtl: in what sense?
Apr 21 21:48:34 <wasamasa>	same syntax as in org
Apr 21 21:48:38 <adgtl>	adgtl It comes inbuilt right?
Apr 21 21:48:46 <ldlework>	no
Apr 21 21:48:48 <wasamasa>	- [ ] @npostavs
Apr 21 21:48:52 <adgtl>	ldlework okay
Apr 21 21:49:23 <johnw>	wasamasa: look now
Apr 21 21:49:30 <wasamasa>	woah
Apr 21 21:49:34 <wasamasa>	you're a magician
Apr 21 21:49:41 <johnw>	it's called Emacs ;-)
Apr 21 21:49:54 <johnw>	the source of my powers
Apr 21 21:49:59 <wasamasa>	ok, that was the easy part
Apr 21 21:50:04 <adgtl>	Any command to expand results of profiler-report?
Apr 21 21:50:14 <johnw>	next, let's add full names next to the handles
Apr 21 21:50:15 <wasamasa>	the hard part is updating the checkboxes according to your data collected so far
Apr 21 21:50:19 <johnw>	yep
Apr 21 21:50:33 <wasamasa>	there's some GNU service for figuring out whether a full name has copyright assignment
Apr 21 21:50:35 <johnw>	with the full names and e-mails, and the copyright.lst file on the FSF servers, it should take a few hours to match up
Apr 21 21:51:30 <ldlework>	huh
Apr 21 21:52:15 <wasamasa>	I have a similar blocker for yaml-mode :<
Apr 21 21:55:07 <adam_erc>	wasamasa I just discovered your shackle project. Nice work! Looking forward to using it for working in org-edit-special
Apr 21 21:55:07 <narendraj9>	How do you handle both hard/soft (for allowing mail clients to flow text
Apr 21 21:55:08 <narendraj9>	as needed for the device, e.g. a mobile screen) newlines and verbatim
Apr 21 21:55:08 <narendraj9>	text (e.g. ASCII diagrams/tables) in Gnus? 
Apr 21 21:55:23 <wasamasa>	adam_erc: thanks
Apr 21 21:56:49 <spikemaster>	is there an eval-BEFORE-load macro in emacs? i have only found "after" versions.
Apr 21 21:57:13 <ldlework>	in straight it is :init
Apr 21 21:57:13 <spikemaster>	like i want the delayed sleep until the package is loaded.  But execution before the load, not after
Apr 21 21:57:32 <adam_erc>	hey wasamasa I don't suppose you do any coding in R with Packrat or renv?
Apr 21 21:57:47 <spikemaster>	does straight :init actually sleep the code until right before teh package is loaded?  or does it cheat and execute during init time?
Apr 21 21:58:26 <johnw>	wasamasa: and check again :)
Apr 21 21:58:29 <johnw>	I used the GitHub API
Apr 21 21:58:32 <wgreenhouse>	narendraj9: you are talking about format=flowed, and there are some notes at https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusFormatFlowed
Apr 21 21:58:43 <ldlework>	spikemaster: i'm not sure what you mean by sleep but the forms are evaluated at the time before the package is loaded for the first time.
Apr 21 21:59:09 <wasamasa>	johnw: magnificient
Apr 21 21:59:19 <sonjah>	hi how can i get the current line in emacs?  https://privatebin.at/?ae784ba4b3f7ec97#3mD8vVgPrZHdC5yXAcPSNv6jsWgwWmehH545FaC5n8Dz
Apr 21 21:59:31 <wasamasa>	johnw: I think @fuco is bogus, it should just be @Fuco1
Apr 21 21:59:43 <ryouma>	i want my rcirc buffers to have font that is larger than my default font, but not to change my default font or any other bufffers.  i'm not sure this works: (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook 'my-set-rcirc-font) (defun my-set-rcirc-font () (face-spec-set 'default '((t ( :height 2 ))))).  what would work?
Apr 21 21:59:53 <spikemaster>	by sleep i mean not executed during the emacs startup.  deplayed until right before the package is loaded.
Apr 21 22:00:56 <johnw>	wasamasa: so, you want to take this over? :)
Apr 21 22:01:12 <johnw>	such a nice, white fence
Apr 21 22:01:21 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 21 22:01:27 <wasamasa>	I just happen to recognize some names
Apr 21 22:01:31 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: you might want to look into whether ,,df buffer-face-mode,, could suit your needs
Apr 21 22:01:31 <fsbot>	buffer-face-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function
Apr 21 22:01:32 <fsbot>	in ‘face-remap.el’.
Apr 21 22:01:32 <fsbot>	(buffer-face-mode &optional ARG)
Apr 21 22:01:32 <fsbot>	Minor mode for a buffer-specific default face. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Apr 21 22:01:32 <ldlework>	spikemaster: yes that is how it works
Apr 21 22:01:50 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: since it sounds like you may be inventing that
Apr 21 22:02:00 <ryouma>	one reason i don't use use-package is, although this might not be relevant to it, that problems of sequencing when things are loaded, in the context of autoload and requires inside packages, are solved by setting load path once, and not allowing anything else to set it.
Apr 21 22:02:23 <johnw>	not sure I understand, ryouma...
Apr 21 22:02:39 <adam_erc>	Does anyone here use org-babel with ESS/R? I am looking to get started with Packrat to version control my R packages. I like the idea of keeping all my packages in a global cache that each project can link into. But how do I import packages that are not project specific? Like roxygen2, devtools, etc.?
Apr 21 22:02:57 <spikemaster>	might take a look at straight then.  if only to steal it's eval-BEFORE-load macro.
Apr 21 22:03:53 <johnw>	spikemaster: in up terms that would be: (use-package foo :defer t :config FORMS...)
Apr 21 22:04:30 <narendraj9>	wgreenhouse: I went through the Emacs wiki entry. It doesn't mention how you can have both: format=flowed text in the email + ability have ASCII or verbatim text in some part of the same email. I would like to have a setup like this so that the paragraphs in my emails are easy to read and at the same time, ASCII tables are not disturbed by an email client on a mobile phone.
Apr 21 22:06:42 <wgreenhouse>	narendraj9: I don't think you can (easily) force a format=flowed mailclient with a small number of display columns, such as a mobile, not to disturb/reformat an ascii table. the mailclient has no idea it's a table, and the entire mime part will be treated the same. the solution here least likely to break would be to compose html mail with an html table.
Apr 21 22:07:15 <wasamasa>	johnw: I'm curious though, do people who don't disclose their name not get copyright assignment?
Apr 21 22:07:39 <johnw>	wasamasa: um, we'd have to withdraw their contribution if we can't find out who they are
Apr 21 22:07:55 <wasamasa>	ok
Apr 21 22:07:57 <ryouma>	wgreenhouse: that looks promising.  what do i do with buffer-face-mode-face, which is now set to variable-pitch?  do i have to define my own face?  hmm, plist maybe.  let me try that.  is this the only solution?  (add-hook 'rcirc-mode-hook 'buffer-face-mode) (setq buffer-face-mode-face '(:inherit variable-pitch :height 2.0))
Apr 21 22:07:58 <wasamasa>	some have funny names
Apr 21 22:08:09 <ryouma>	also will it interact with text-scale-increase, which seems to activate the lighter for bufface?
Apr 21 22:08:33 <wasamasa>	like someone going by Philipp and working at Google :D
Apr 21 22:08:39 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: buffer-face-mode-face can be what you want, does not have to be variable-pitch. I think that's the default only because variable-pitch-mode uses buffer-face-mode
Apr 21 22:08:58 <lampilelo>	wasamasa: it's like you said: if you don't refuse quick enough you'll become a maintainer
Apr 21 22:09:12 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: and yeah, I think something like your snippet would work
Apr 21 22:09:23 <ryouma>	johnw: i presume, without evidence, that use-package has the feature of loading.  if so, then that feature is laoded all over your .meacs where you call use-package.  so it breaks the set load path in one place principle for making repeatable load sequences.
Apr 21 22:09:33 <wasamasa>	lampilelo: what happened?
Apr 21 22:10:07 <ryouma>	wgreenhouse: i wonder if i eliminate the first plist pair and just do height if thast woul dstill retain the variable pitch
Apr 21 22:12:46 <lampilelo>	wasamasa: i'm referring to what you said about how to become an emacs maintainer and the fact that johnw wants to trick you into taking over the issue of use-package
Apr 21 22:13:29 <wasamasa>	well, it would be a bit hard to actually do since my copyright assignment is no longer valid :D
Apr 21 22:16:13 <grym>	technomancy: ... you're the atreus guy, aren't you '
Apr 21 22:17:14 <lampilelo>	wasamasa: just wait, the papers will get to you when you least expect it, sneakily
Apr 21 22:17:31 <wasamasa>	bonus: I don't use use-package at all
Apr 21 22:19:06 <technomancy>	grym: yes. =)
Apr 21 22:19:49 <miskatonic>	does rms use use-package?
Apr 21 22:19:53 <grym>	technomancy: i just cottoned to the URL 
Apr 21 22:20:09 <grym>	technomancy: i am not the smartest of monkeys.  anyway, nice shit :D 
Apr 21 22:20:37 <technomancy>	grym: thanks! I used emacs.
Apr 21 22:21:25 <grym>	haha 
Apr 21 22:23:45 <spikemaster>	(emacs-init-time) => 0.226422064 seconds.   over 122 packages.
Apr 21 22:24:07 <grym>	spikemaster: and now with emacsclient.. 
Apr 21 22:24:07 <nikitamog>	Say, I have multiple, instances of emacs running. emacsclient can't share buffers between them, can it? I just want to look at some stuff on another monitor.
Apr 21 22:25:52 <spikemaster>	can you "force" a true restart on emacs client? like if you bork something up badly and just need shut down emacs
Apr 21 22:26:21 <wasamasa>	M-x kill-emacs
Apr 21 22:27:01 <spikemaster>	ooo
Apr 21 22:27:30 <spikemaster>	i still value making emacs init fast. First time matters too.  I used to have like a 40+ second load time.
Apr 21 22:27:45 <grym>	speed matters. 
Apr 21 22:29:17 <technomancy>	I started a new emacs process a few times this year
Apr 21 22:29:30 <spikemaster>	omg. got init time down to 0.1 seconds in the terminal. without the GUI.
Apr 21 22:29:55 <technomancy>	maybe soon I'll be in the double digits if I'm an idiot and let my battery die again
Apr 21 22:30:05 <wasamasa>	it's just a number and can be messed ith
Apr 21 22:30:58 <nikitamog>	,numbers

Apr 21 22:31:57 <mixfix41>	rudybot: warm pools
Apr 21 22:31:57 <rudybot>	mixfix41: It's fundamentally different from the situation faced by unthinking beasts with homogeneous gene pools.
Apr 21 22:32:27 <nkazui>	hello, has emacs been removed in the last macos catalina? not that i was using it from there but just curious. I know it was shipping the outdated Emacs 22 without gui support in the past macos releases
Apr 21 22:33:34 <mixfix41>	i think youd have to ask apple esp since they dont document
Apr 21 22:34:28 <nkazui>	i will call customer service ^^
Apr 21 22:34:37 <mixfix41>	id try to post on their forums
Apr 21 22:34:47 <mixfix41>	a call even seems vain same as
Apr 21 22:34:57 <nkazui>	yea
Apr 21 22:35:04 <technomancy>	"I 'upgraded' my computer and it got worse! it went from being a computer that has emacs on it to a computer that doesn't have emacs on it! useless!"
Apr 21 22:35:15 <nkazui>	lol
Apr 21 22:35:43 <technomancy>	"can't believe I paid money for this"
Apr 21 22:35:59 <nkazui>	pretty sure they would confuse the word mac with emacs
Apr 21 22:35:59 <grym>	pro tip, get the grant to buy your hardware 
Apr 21 22:36:05 <grym>	but for sure buy your own peripherals 
Apr 21 22:36:13 <mixfix41>	actually i think theres work being done to try to get linux app to launch natively in macos isnt that what mojofs does
Apr 21 22:36:13 <noobly>	so how do I graph latex input in emacs calc?
Apr 21 22:36:14 <grym>	my keyboard and mouse are _mine_ thank you 
Apr 21 22:43:36 <Samo_svoj>	Why emacs on mac takes 70MB of memory just to start when MacVim takes only 15MB (I believe that it is also so much it can be as little as 5MB)?
Apr 21 22:44:05 <lxbarbosa>	Samo_svoj: because vim sucks :D
Apr 21 22:44:13 <grym>	Samo_svoj: they're very different things 
Apr 21 22:44:31 <lxbarbosa>	I rather use kate or nano :D
Apr 21 22:44:52 <nkazui>	pico!

Apr 21 22:47:50 <nikitamog>	Samo_svoj: vim is quite barebones as its own editor. Emacs comes packaged with a bunch of elisp to interact with a computer environment. More code; more memory.
Apr 21 22:49:18 <noobly>	there seems to be a bug or something I don't understand about emacs-calc, it's like when I launch calc mode, it cannablizes my current buffer and even steals it's name.. 
Apr 21 22:49:49 <bremner>	how do you launch it?
Apr 21 22:49:58 <bremner>	don't use M-x calc-mode
Apr 21 22:50:30 <noobly>	bremner: thanks, I launch it normally by just typing calc-mode. so when I did it earlier in my #emacs buffer, it ate it and I couldn't get #emacs back
Apr 21 22:50:35 <bremner>	M-x calc
Apr 21 22:50:43 <bremner>	yeah as I said, don't do that
Apr 21 22:51:15 <bremner>	basically emacs is doing what you tell it to, switching the current buffer to calc mode
Apr 21 22:51:24 <bremner>	that's probably almost never what you want
Apr 21 22:51:26 <noobly>	yeah, going forward I won't, glad it was an easy fix
Apr 21 22:52:04 <noobly>	bremner: how would I get it to go back to calc-mode off, and get #emacs back then? it's not super relevant now that I have a fix, but im still curious
Apr 21 22:52:25 <cvandusen>	rudybot: sometimes the easiest fix is to do nothing 
Apr 21 22:52:27 <rudybot>	cvandusen: sometimes i don't see the easiest solution
Apr 21 22:52:48 <bremner>	noobly: I don't know if it's fixable. 
Apr 21 22:53:30 <nikitamog>	noobly: are you using rcirc?
Apr 21 22:54:18 <noobly>	nikitamog, no erc, hadn't heard of rcirc until now
Apr 21 22:54:51 <spikemaster>	someone on the internet left vim becuase it was too bloated. Replaced with busybox vi
Apr 21 22:54:55 <nikitamog>	then idk I've only used the default irc client in emacs to date.
Apr 21 22:55:44 <noobly>	nikitamog: yeah, running M-x calc instead of calc-mode fixes it really, now I just have to figure out how to input latex and output a graph
Apr 21 22:56:38 <nikitamog>	I gotta master latex at some point. T'would be excellent for publishing research papers.
Apr 21 22:58:03 <noobly>	unfortunately I'm not doing anything nearly as cool

Apr 21 22:58:37 <quiliro>	woops
Apr 21 22:58:51 <technomancy>	ed doesn't waste space on my timex sinclair
Apr 21 22:59:54 <grym>	nikitamog: it's not that hard really, and auctex is nice.  the biggest pains in the ass are 1. reference management (which there are good solutions to now) and 2. tables (same thing) 
Apr 21 23:00:14 <grym>	otherwise it's pretty chatty as a langauge but quite servicable 
Apr 21 23:01:49 <nikitamog>	grym: good to know.
Apr 21 23:02:29 <grym>	nikitamog: also lua/xelatex are nice, and for the most part latex knows where to put figures better than you do
Apr 21 23:03:43 <noobly>	grym: how does the lualatex experience differ?
Apr 21 23:04:02 <Samo_svoj>	is it possible to lower default memory usage of emacs?
Apr 21 23:04:46 <grym>	noobly: luatex and xelatex let you use ttf fonts 
Apr 21 23:04:56 <grym>	there's more voodoo in there but i don't care 
Apr 21 23:06:15 <noobly>	there's also that scriblio scheme-like thing, sounded kind of cool
Apr 21 23:13:30 <spikemaster>	timex sinclair as development box
Apr 21 23:14:27 <spikemaster>	i always imagined a timex watch, being used as the dev computer. didn't realzie it was a real computer.
Apr 21 23:14:43 <spikemaster>	like a wrist watch
Apr 21 23:16:26 <spikemaster>	Samo_svoj: if you build emacs yourself you may be able to strip out unwanted features. Or use one of the tiny emacs clones like mg.
Apr 21 23:17:44 <mixfix41>	vim needs a config file theres something feely about it that doesnt feel great i should probs find a vim gui while at it but then just learn emacs for me
Apr 21 23:19:03 <nikitamog>	Do y'all have a little column-rule when you code?
Apr 21 23:19:14 <nikitamog>	I want one but it seems like a hassle.
Apr 21 23:24:14 <nikitamog>	"vim gui"
Apr 21 23:25:52 <Samo_svoj>	Can I use sbcl in mg? Can I use it for same thing as I use emacs?
Apr 21 23:31:12 <bremner>	no
Apr 21 23:31:17 <ayuce>	how much is the "default memory usage of emacs", Samo_svoj?
Apr 21 23:32:09 <Samo_svoj>	ayuce: when I start emacs (not in terminal but in GUI) it takes 70MB. I would like to see max 15MB.
Apr 21 23:32:27 <Samo_svoj>	There is no need to load more unless you want.
Apr 21 23:33:41 <bremner>	Samo_svoj: so, just so I know how much to invest in this, do you actually have a memory shortage, or is this some abstract game?
Apr 21 23:33:47 <grym>	Samo_svoj: i have 64 gigs of ram; why do i care?
Apr 21 23:34:00 <bremner>	Samo_svoj: since you're running sbcl, I guess the latter
Apr 21 23:35:16 <Samo_svoj>	bremner: I do not want that you invest your time if you do not want. I just do not want to load something I do not need.
Apr 21 23:36:23 <Samo_svoj>	grym: you have 64GB ram on Mac?
Apr 21 23:36:27 <nikitamog>	I feel like a deer looking at headlights when I'm typing in firefox. Emacs has broken me.
Apr 21 23:49:39 <bpalmer>	the NeWS article from earlier today warned about X.  More than 22 commodore 64s put together didn't have the memory to run XClock
Apr 21 23:49:59 <bpalmer>	we were warned, and we didn't listen. 
Apr 21 23:50:08 <greenline>	XClock.
Apr 21 23:50:48 <bpalmer>	Imagine putting a man in the moon with under 1GB of memory.
Apr 21 23:50:58 <Samo_svoj>	May I ask here - does anyone know good free news server?
Apr 21 23:51:42 <bpalmer>	if you're looking for usenet, you might try eternal-september.org
Apr 21 23:53:03 <Samo_svoj>	bpalmer: thanks, pal!
Apr 21 23:54:08 *	ecbrown hopes you like text newsgroups
Apr 21 23:54:48 <grym>	Samo_svoj: no, this is my ubuntu box
Apr 22 00:01:26 <technomancy>	to be fair, measuring time is basically completely impossible to do properly

Apr 22 13:44:30 <jamzattack>	yo quiliro
Apr 22 13:45:06 <celadevra>	mokulus: there's erc-disconnected-hook and erc-connect-pre-hook, you can use them to set some variables that tell connection status.
Apr 22 13:45:19 <wasamasa>	the cheap way would be to test for the existence of some buffer

Apr 22 14:43:00 <Ronis_BR>	Notice that I have three equal groups to be matched by rx. Is there any way to make this simpler?

Apr 22 15:03:40 <wasamasa>	Ronis_BR: it's s-expressions, you can reuse parts of them by using rx-to-string

Apr 22 15:23:25 <bpalmer>	docview is included, I believe
Apr 22 15:30:04 <bpalmer>	Let's graph some numbers and pretend we are now experts.
Apr 22 15:31:11 <yates_home>	i think this may be a stupid question, but if i have files a.el and b.el, how do i "include" b.el in a.el? 
Apr 22 15:31:42 <bpalmer>	yates_home: (load "b.el")  . If it makes sense to split into two files, though, it's likely to make sense to have two, very related, libraries.
Apr 22 15:31:52 <bpalmer>	so that you can simply  (require 'b)  
Apr 22 15:32:20 <yates_home>	ok. right, "load"
Apr 22 15:32:49 <yates_home>	thanks bpalmer

Apr 22 15:35:35 <bpalmer>	just make sure you pack a jerry can of spares.
Apr 22 15:35:53 <yates_home>	hmm. that didn't work
Apr 22 15:38:02 <bpalmer>	,doesntwork
Apr 22 15:38:04 <fsbot>	We can help you with your problem better if your error description is more informative than "it doesn't work"
Apr 22 15:38:34 <yates_home>	here's file b.el: https://paste.centos.org/view/8ad64c84
Apr 22 15:39:36 <grym>	bpalmer: or a patch kit will usually do 
Apr 22 15:39:42 <yates_home>	when i evaluate a.el, which is (load "b.el"), C-c C-c is undefined
Apr 22 15:40:29 <bpalmer>	yates_home: and you have debug-on-error set to t?
Apr 22 15:41:06 <yates_home>	i'll try that, but nothing is showing up in the message buffer
Apr 22 15:41:15 <bpalmer>	yates_home: actually, how are you evaluating a.el ?
Apr 22 15:41:27 <bpalmer>	doing these sorts of local-variable and local-maps at the top level is unusual.
Apr 22 15:41:47 <bpalmer>	you have to be careful about which buffer is active
Apr 22 15:42:16 <bpalmer>	if you're trying to configure things, it's usually a good idea to load a file that defines a function which you evaluate in each buffer you want so configured.
Apr 22 15:43:11 <yates_home>	bpalmer: basically with a (load ...) in my own hook to find-file-hook
Apr 22 15:43:14 <bpalmer>	I believe (load "a.el") will open a new buffer with a.el's contents and evaluate it there, before discarding it, so the local map etc will be thrown away. Have not verified this theory, though.
Apr 22 15:43:23 <yates_home>	https://paste.centos.org/view/33879787
Apr 22 15:43:57 <bpalmer>	yates_home: yes, have a.el define a function that you then call from your hook function.
Apr 22 15:44:57 <bpalmer>	yates_home: or, alternatively, (let ((buffer-to-work-on  (current-buffer))) (load "a.el"))  and have at the very top of a.el , (set-buffer buffer-to-work-on)
Apr 22 15:45:16 <bpalmer>	But that's definitely not what I'd recommend.
Apr 22 15:48:46 <yates_home>	bpalmer: if the code in b.el runs fine when when i edit afile.b, then why wouldn't the code in a.el run fine when i edit afile.a ?
Apr 22 15:49:12 <yates_home>	if a.el loads b.el?
Apr 22 15:49:34 <bpalmer>	yates_home: sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question. what is afile.b ?
Apr 22 15:50:49 <yates_home>	the code i pasted above is a generic method for me to customize files by their extension. so for example, if i edit a c file, bch-decode.c, it loads c.el
Apr 22 15:51:26 <yates_home>	so afile.a loads a.el, afile.b loads b.el
Apr 22 15:51:40 <yates_home>	(in the find file hook)
Apr 22 15:52:48 <yates_home>	if it helps i can tell you the real files i'm working on? it shouldn't matter though
Apr 22 15:53:13 <bpalmer>	yates_home: I think my suggested approach will work regardless.
Apr 22 15:53:46 <yates_home>	but i don't want to do that since it will break countless existing files (c.el, for example)
Apr 22 15:54:59 <yates_home>	c.el in many directories and many projects over the years..
Apr 22 15:55:15 <yates_home>	and cpp.el, and tex.el, and blah blah
Apr 22 15:55:40 <bpalmer>	try the set-buffer approach or add a (message "%s %s" (buffer-name) (buffer-file-name))  and take a look at the message log
Apr 22 15:55:47 <bpalmer>	see if my hypothesis makes sense.
Apr 22 15:56:38 <apteryx>	hello! I'm just starting to use helm, and was wondering if there's a way to use helm-semantic-or-imenu as a 'go to symbol definition' on a single key press?
Apr 22 15:59:42 <yates_home>	it's not worth this. i just duplicate the code. uggh.
Apr 22 15:59:48 <yates_home>	i'll
Apr 22 16:00:06 <yates_home>	i could altnerately use a symlink
Apr 22 16:01:11 <bpalmer>	I suspect it wouldn't be as much work to turn these into functions as you're thinking, though.
Apr 22 16:01:59 <bpalmer>	b.el : stick a (defun do-things-for-b ()   as the first line, stick a  ) as the last line).  Then everywhere you do (load "b.el") , do (load "b.el") (do-things-for-b)
Apr 22 16:02:31 <bpalmer>	or (defun do-things-for-b () (interactive) ...)  so you can M-x do-things-for-b RET by hand.
Apr 22 16:02:42 <bpalmer>	plus the (load "b.el") (do-things-for-b)
Apr 22 16:05:25 *	apteryx answering my own question: tl;dr: no. It seems helm support for semantic is mostly useful to get insights about the *current buffer*, not as a mean to navigate a whole project.
Apr 22 16:12:54 <crowbar>	X forwarding emacs, is there a way to open a link with my local instance of firefox? I vaguely recall being able to do that, as accidentally opening a forwarded firefox is incredibly laggy.

Apr 22 16:15:38 <Defolos>	Does anyone know how much of GConf2 is used in emacs?
Apr 22 16:16:12 <Defolos>	It recentely got orphaned in Fedora and I want to drop it from the Fedora package, but I don't want to loose a whole bunch of functionality
Apr 22 16:19:37 <wasamasa>	I can find it in dynamic-setting.el
Apr 22 16:23:30 <npostavs>	Isn't gconf replaced gsettings?
Apr 22 16:23:45 <npostavs>	*replaced by
Apr 22 16:24:50 <Defolos>	npostavs: yes, gsettings is the replacement
Apr 22 16:24:58 <Defolos>	but I don't know the status of that in emacs
Apr 22 16:25:05 <Defolos>	that's why I'm asking here
Apr 22 16:32:00 <apteryx>	is it possible to add semantic as a backend for xref? So that native M-. and M-, would work by preferring semantic tags if any, and fall back to the usual TAGS database otherwise?
Apr 22 16:35:03 <wasamasa>	Defolos: xsettings.c mentions both HAVE_GCONF and HAVE_GSETTINGS
Apr 22 16:36:22 <wasamasa>	Defolos: try compiling emacs without gconf and see what happens with the single function depending on it
Apr 22 16:36:30 <wasamasa>	Defolos: chances are it will work fine
Apr 22 16:39:38 <Defolos>	wasamasa: I will try to look into that, thank you!
Apr 22 16:39:47 <wgreenhouse>	crowbar: I think your compromise is probably the least hairy one available; the alternative involves doing network forwarding of dbus
Apr 22 16:41:40 <wgreenhouse>	A sad case of "just because X is a network-transparent protocol doesn't mean X client apps are any good at being used anywhere but from your desk"
Apr 22 16:42:28 <bpalmer>	alternatively, allow ssh/rsh/etc back from the remote host , and make your browse url command communicate back to the local machine
Apr 22 16:43:03 <bpalmer>	or, alternatively, set up a polling mechanism on the far end that communicates with your local browser, potentially using an ssh proxy
Apr 22 16:43:33 <bpalmer>	or, run emacs in a terminal and use the terminal click url functionality rather than the editor's
Apr 22 16:43:59 <wgreenhouse>	or use the XTEST extension of x11 to let the remote emacs type out a firefox command on the local X server
Apr 22 16:44:23 <wgreenhouse>	do a little self-hacking
Apr 22 16:44:48 <wgreenhouse>	(this is the chaotic evil option)
Apr 22 16:47:05 <bpalmer>	The polling option shouldn't be too hard to write.
Apr 22 16:49:05 <bpalmer>	I think offby1 may have already written this, in fact.
Apr 22 16:56:49 <bpalmer>	actually, come to think of it, you could probably use something like https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2010/remote-tabs-google-chrome/ (firefox will have something similar, perhaps) and then just do an ssh port forwarding scheme
Apr 22 17:06:36 <crowbar>	thanks wgreenhouse bpalmer.  I'll take a look at that.  Local machine is windows, so slightly constrained but not too much
Apr 22 17:12:09 <adgtl>	Folks, I have very bad looking magit-ediff
Apr 22 17:12:15 <adgtl>	It shows in while color where I can't read
Apr 22 17:12:20 <adgtl>	anyone know how to fix it
Apr 22 17:12:23 <adgtl>	See here - https://i.imgur.com/EGFZybD.png
Apr 22 17:13:27 <davemq>	adgtl: try a different theme
Apr 22 17:14:05 <crowbar>	Any way to test if the current frame is displayed locally or through a forwarded display?  Would make life easier when I'm at the local machine, if I have to stick with the copy url to clipboard.
Apr 22 17:14:21 <holomorph>	adgtl: you can inspect what faces are the culprit with C-u C-x =
Apr 22 17:15:19 <geldmacher>	Anyone else having issues with company-mode and linum in 27? My line-numbers disappear where the popup box is drawn as shown here: https://i.imgur.com/v5E41lo.jpg
Apr 22 17:16:08 <wasamasa>	try the native line numbers
Apr 22 17:16:16 <adgtl>	holomorph - that shows this http://dpaste.com/2TPCJHS
Apr 22 17:18:20 <hodapp>	rudybot: which one spins around more times, a dog taking a shit or a cat trying to get comfortable on my lap?
Apr 22 17:18:43 <rudybot>	hodapp: is there any way to do that against the local branch instead of upstream? it spins like mad every time it runs or I cherry-pick
Apr 22 17:19:59 <geldmacher>	wasamasa: (display-line-numbers 'relative) has the same issue
Apr 22 17:20:04 <holomorph>	geldmacher: busted for me in 28 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ linum-mode and display-line-numbers-mode
Apr 22 17:21:11 <holomorph>	oh goodness now there are major and minor tick faces
Apr 22 17:21:27 <geldmacher>	mhh so no fix to be expected soon :)
Apr 22 17:21:36 <adgtl>	holomorph wow C-u C-x =
Apr 22 17:23:46 <miskatonic>	rudybot: mice on the desktop are the worst plague; therefore, ratpoison is an optimal companion for emacs on X11
Apr 22 17:24:06 <rudybot>	miskatonic: "It is known for being the only story of the classic series run to feature the Doctor without a companion"
Apr 22 17:26:10 <geldmacher>	ughh I just read that the company devs requested this "hiding-linenumbers-feature" for company to run -.-
Apr 22 17:26:30 <geldmacher>	why tho..
Apr 22 17:28:02 <wasamasa>	take a guess
Apr 22 17:28:16 <wasamasa>	you might realize something terrifying
Apr 22 17:28:33 <geldmacher>	:o
Apr 22 17:28:48 *	JordiGH pours one out for the blog series we have lost.
Apr 22 17:29:25 <miskatonic>	the company is a bunch of capitalist-imperialist creeps?
Apr 22 17:29:40 <wasamasa>	geldmacher: my guess is that it wouldn't work otherwise
Apr 22 17:29:59 <wasamasa>	geldmacher: you get either one or the other
Apr 22 17:30:30 <geldmacher>	wasamasa: the other one being the package to not work at all?
Apr 22 17:30:41 <wasamasa>	yes
Apr 22 17:30:53 <wasamasa>	either line numbers work perfectly well or company works perfectly well
Apr 22 17:31:32 <geldmacher>	alright alright I guess I take the missing numbers and a small coke
Apr 22 17:37:21 <bpalmer>	rudybot: coca-cola? We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
Apr 22 17:37:32 <rudybot>	bpalmer: The best visual effect in any sci-fi film has to be the floating pen in 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's just floating in the spaceship and the woman grabs it outta midair and starts writing with it! How did Kubrick do that in 1969? Still my favorite film from my favorite director. —machin3man
Apr 22 17:39:27 <thblt>	rudybot: you credit the original authors of your replies now?
Apr 22 17:39:37 <rudybot>	thblt: hrgh. why are fsbot's replies getting truncated.
Apr 22 17:40:10 <bpalmer>	perhaps only when rudybot is quoting someone, not when rudybot is speaking for itself.
Apr 22 17:40:36 <lxsameer>	hey folks, is there any function like `princ` that returns the string instead of printing it ?
Apr 22 17:41:06 <bpalmer>	format "%s"
Apr 22 17:41:22 <bpalmer>	C-h f format RET  '%s means print a string argument.  Actually, prints any object, with ‘princ’.'
Apr 22 17:41:26 <lxsameer>	bpalmer: hmm but format doesn't convert all the objects to string 
Apr 22 17:41:30 <thblt>	or (princ object 'ignore)
Apr 22 17:41:46 <lxsameer>	does it ?
Apr 22 17:41:47 <bpalmer>	lxsameer: (format "%s" o)  what object type o does nto get printed?
Apr 22 17:42:24 <lxsameer>	bpalmer: ah, you're right, thanks 
Apr 22 17:43:13 <bpalmer>	It's neat to see how the floating pen was actually done.
Apr 22 17:43:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	How was it done?
Apr 22 17:46:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Also the talk of x11 programs over the network make me wonder how badly or well Emacs Server would work ssh-forwarded
Apr 22 17:46:36 <bpalmer>	It's explained in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W9KT0Flj5o ; but , basically, there's a clear sheet of glass.
Apr 22 17:47:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh, like those walking-on-water magic tricks.
Apr 22 17:47:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It was pretty well done. Will watch the full vid a little while later.
Apr 22 17:47:57 <ym>	Hi. Was there an attempt to use web browser (WebKit) as GUI front end for Emacs?
Apr 22 17:48:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I've heard of the reverse.
Apr 22 17:48:39 <miskatonic>	ezbl
Apr 22 17:49:09 <miskatonic>	but it died with the transition to webkit2-gtk
Apr 22 17:51:34 <ym>	Nah, I'm more interested in cutting-off basic Emacs' functionality and mating it with something simple, like DRM/KMS.
Apr 22 17:51:57 <bpalmer>	kms?
Apr 22 17:52:31 <wasamasa>	low-level linux display stuff
Apr 22 17:53:09 <wasamasa>	and calling that stack simple is an understatement
Apr 22 17:53:29 <ym>	It's simple-APIed.
Apr 22 17:53:40 <ym>	Abstracted the right way.
Apr 22 17:53:44 <wasamasa>	the API may look easy, but that doesn't mean anything
Apr 22 17:54:01 <wasamasa>	anyway, are you the chosen one who will drag emacs kicking and screaming into full wayland support?
Apr 22 17:54:48 <ym>	I'm not very familiar with wayland, saw a couple of presentations about it though.
Apr 22 17:54:55 <miskatonic>	no wayland for me
Apr 22 17:55:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'd rather like wayland. It had a few hiccups though when I tried it. No ibus support & keepassxc interacts a bit weirdly with it.
Apr 22 17:56:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ibus has become less problematic since I learned Emacs has IME, admitedly.
Apr 22 17:57:08 <ym>	Sway always hanged after some time for me. Not sure if it's sway's or wayland's problem.
Apr 22 17:57:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Probably the Sway version you tested, mine didn't do that.
Apr 22 18:09:12 <apteryx>	is there a way to compose interactive functions without loosing the individual interactive handling of each functions being composed?
Apr 22 18:10:56 <bpalmer>	call-interactively
Apr 22 18:11:05 <Ronis_BR>	wasamasa: Thanks!!
Apr 22 18:11:09 <bpalmer>	but I wouldn't recommend chaining it like that.
Apr 22 18:12:43 <apteryx>	bpalmer: what would you recommend instead?
Apr 22 18:13:07 <ym_>	Just tried wayland+sway, reloaded configuration - all the system hanged. Even keyboard input. Only C-M-SysRq-o helped.
Apr 22 18:13:28 <perrier-jouet>	is vterm the best terminal for emacs ?
Apr 22 18:13:31 <bpalmer>	apteryx: only the outermost function being interactive, and then calling each providing the needed context/arguments
Apr 22 18:13:31 <perrier-jouet>	or eshell ?
Apr 22 18:13:39 <wgreenhouse>	perrier-jouet: they serve different purposes.
Apr 22 18:13:49 <bpalmer>	eshell is not a terminal. It's just a shell, like bash, but written in elisp
Apr 22 18:13:52 <apteryx>	bpalmer: OK.
Apr 22 18:14:11 <bpalmer>	This means eshell is convenient and portable wherever emacs runs (most notably, on windows)
Apr 22 18:14:32 <bremner>	I wonder if ,,rash,, runs on windows
Apr 22 18:14:33 <fsbot>	rash is RAcket SHell: https://docs.racket-lang.org/rash/index.html
Apr 22 18:15:12 <perrier-jouet>	best terminal which one is it ?
Apr 22 18:15:26 <perrier-jouet>	best terminal emulator 
Apr 22 18:15:46 <wgreenhouse>	perrier-jouet: as bpalmer just explained, eshell is not a terminal emulator, so something-not-eshell.
Apr 22 18:15:47 <bpalmer>	I wouldn't recommend any terminal that runs inside emacs.
Apr 22 18:16:12 <wgreenhouse>	eshell is a shell, or shell language, that lets you mix shell commands with elisp commands
Apr 22 18:16:14 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ym: Huh. I wonder what's up with that. It worked when I tried it on Arch. 
Apr 22 18:16:24 <wgreenhouse>	it doesn't do curses full-screen terminal apps
Apr 22 18:16:34 <wasamasa>	try vterm and tell us
Apr 22 18:16:36 <perrier-jouet>	I know with eshell you can do more than shell
Apr 22 18:16:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ym: Perhaps it's broken. Or perhaps it doesn't like something in your config. Both are rather undesirable.
Apr 22 18:16:50 <wasamasa>	eshell and vterm are two very different beasts
Apr 22 18:16:55 <perrier-jouet>	with eshell we can edit the output of ls etc
Apr 22 18:16:58 <miskatonic>	M-x term is cool
Apr 22 18:17:10 <wasamasa>	you cannot play nethack with eshell
Apr 22 18:17:24 <wasamasa>	for that eshell can only start a terminal emulator
Apr 22 18:20:19 <wgreenhouse>	also vterm is only on linux, and only for an emacs that was built with dynamic modules support, aiui
Apr 22 18:20:29 <wgreenhouse>	and probably only makes sense to use from gui emacs
Apr 22 18:20:42 <miskatonic>	isn't vterm used by neovim?
Apr 22 18:20:51 <wasamasa>	neovim uses its own thing
Apr 22 18:21:03 <wasamasa>	it cannot load emacs modules yet, lol
Apr 22 18:21:29 <miskatonic>	on debian 9  neovim is linked against libvterm0
Apr 22 18:21:52 <wasamasa>	the module is different from the library, yes
Apr 22 18:23:45 <caveman-ULTRA>	guys
Apr 22 18:24:06 <caveman-ULTRA>	is there any great rss feeds reader for emacs?
Apr 22 18:24:34 <ym>	RSS is alive?
Apr 22 18:24:35 <xristos>	elfeed
Apr 22 18:24:50 <xristos>	 it's a great reader period, not just because it runs on emacs
Apr 22 18:25:03 <caveman-ULTRA>	ym: yes..  much better than logging into utube to get video fees.  all ur feeds, e.g. new videos, appear in ur feed.
Apr 22 18:25:54 <ym>	caveman-ULTRA, so you watching youtube with Emacs?
Apr 22 18:27:04 <caveman-ULTRA>	ym: no.  i'm anti-emacs pro-vim extremist.  buti want an rss feed, and the cli ones seem to suck.  so, i'm humbly back begging forgiveness from rms.
Apr 22 18:27:53 <bpalmer>	the options I know of are gnus and elfeed.
Apr 22 18:28:17 <xristos>	ym: you can use Emacs to get the feeds, then any player (e.g. mpv) will do
Apr 22 18:28:32 <xristos>	that way you don't have to browse the site and get blasted with crap
Apr 22 18:28:42 <caveman-ULTRA>	should i compile emacs with png/jpg/svg/tiff/gif su pport?
Apr 22 18:28:44 <xristos>	you retain some level of control
Apr 22 18:28:46 <ym>	What crap do you mean?
Apr 22 18:29:01 <xristos>	the crap that hits you when you type www.youtube.com and hit enter
Apr 22 18:29:36 <caveman-ULTRA>	ym: newsfeed, canto (abandoned), etc.  the gui one sicken in other ways.
Apr 22 18:29:45 <caveman-ULTRA>	err, newsboat
Apr 22 18:30:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Personally, I prefer using rss2email & mu4e.
Apr 22 18:30:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It just works better.
Apr 22 18:31:43 <miskatonic>	or use a cli newsfeeder inside emacs
Apr 22 18:32:28 *	ym never ceases to be surprised how IT people prefer cumbersome kludge complexes to just ignoring things they don't like.
Apr 22 18:32:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I didn't like Gnus because it was slow, and elfeed had something about deletion which annoyed me. Can't remember what.
Apr 22 18:33:06 <caveman-ULTRA>	rss is very sad.  loks i must create my own app.
Apr 22 18:33:24 <technomancy>	RSS is bad; atom is good
Apr 22 18:33:33 <caveman-ULTRA>	atom?
Apr 22 18:33:35 <technomancy>	but even worse than RSS is using the term "RSS" to refer to atom
Apr 22 18:33:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Emacs has some great MUAs though. Like mu4e. So the solution was to turn them into emails.
Apr 22 18:33:44 <technomancy>	caveman-ULTRA: the feed syndication format that doesn't suck
Apr 22 18:33:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Atom is just as bad as RSS as far as clients go.
Apr 22 18:34:14 <technomancy>	sure, but like ... it was designed by people who actually knew what escaping was
Apr 22 18:34:31 <technomancy>	instead of just "I dunno put some tags in the content or something; we'll figure it out later"
Apr 22 18:34:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	lol
Apr 22 18:35:36 <technomancy>	"At least email has a spec. RSS just has 'various objections to Dave Winer'"
Apr 22 18:36:05 <miskatonic>	there are also rss/atomfeed to imap converters or something like that
Apr 22 18:36:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That sounds more complicated. You'd need to setup an imap server just for that.
Apr 22 18:37:31 <bpalmer>	I use feedly for RSS/atom feeds nowadays
Apr 22 18:37:46 <caveman-ULTRA>	very sad.  there HAS to be a better way to solve this problem.
Apr 22 18:37:47 <bpalmer>	Since it's in a browser, I can trust it to render content aimed at browsers.
Apr 22 18:38:03 <bpalmer>	and clicking to youtube/etc is trivial
Apr 22 18:38:05 <wasamasa>	caveman-ULTRA: what problem?
Apr 22 18:38:07 <technomancy>	caveman-ULTRA: just use twitter for everything; capitalism has solved it
Apr 22 18:38:25 <wasamasa>	caveman-ULTRA: you haven't even tried elfeed yet
Apr 22 18:38:25 <caveman-ULTRA>	wasamasa: getting rss feeds.
Apr 22 18:38:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	eww. At least use mastodon if you're going to drink the microblogging cool-aid
Apr 22 18:38:45 <ym>	caveman-ULTRA, maybe telegram + some bots.
Apr 22 18:38:53 <caveman-ULTRA>	technomancy: nope.  totally not interested in things posted in twatter.
Apr 22 18:39:01 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: damn it never occurred to me that anyone would take that "worst possible take I could think up" as serious
Apr 22 18:39:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Hm?
Apr 22 18:39:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh. heh.
Apr 22 18:39:46 <technomancy>	obviously don't use twitter, everybody
Apr 22 18:39:49 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I did see as probably sarcastic, but playing with it sounded more fun.
Apr 22 18:39:54 <technomancy>	=)
Apr 22 18:40:02 <bremner>	use mastodon for everything, socialism and self hosting has solved it.
Apr 22 18:40:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	yay~
Apr 22 18:40:32 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Now we just need a resilient, privacy-friendly network layer. :/
Apr 22 18:40:41 <caveman-ULTRA>	web, email, rss -- these things all suck, and must be merged into a single sensible protocol.
Apr 22 18:40:42 <miskatonic>	youtube and twitter are only suitable for mouselovers
Apr 22 18:40:58 <bpalmer>	caveman-ULTRA: good news! It's been done; it's called the world wide web.
Apr 22 18:41:12 <bpalmer>	miskatonic: now that's a weird take.
Apr 22 18:41:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	caveman-ULTRA: How about XMPP⸮
Apr 22 18:42:02 <miskatonic>	bpalmer why is it weird?
Apr 22 18:42:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	One could reasonably easily make a weechat plugin for Twitter.
Apr 22 18:42:34 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I think they started blocking requests for API keys?
Apr 22 18:42:50 <bpalmer>	miskatonic: because there's no need to use a mouse with those sites.
Apr 22 18:42:57 <technomancy>	only grandfathered-in API keys function now, or something
Apr 22 18:42:58 <wgreenhouse>	,,bitlbee,, can still tweet but the streaming API is b0rken
Apr 22 18:42:59 <fsbot>	BitlBee is [0/4] an irc server that acts as a proxy for various IM services at http://www.bitlbee.org/
Apr 22 18:42:59 <fsbot>	[1] at http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BitlBee
Apr 22 18:42:59 <fsbot>	[2] To get messages from people to show up in separate buffers, try `set private=true'
Apr 22 18:42:59 <fsbot>	[3] See elim for an alternative
Apr 22 18:42:59 <fsbot>	[4] See also minbif
Apr 22 18:43:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Wow. I guess they sure must like XML parsers and bandwidth waste.
Apr 22 18:44:20 <wasamasa>	imagine trading old API keys
Apr 22 18:44:43 <technomancy>	I'm 100% sure there's a black market, yeah
Apr 22 18:44:45 <wasamasa>	now that's the kind of hoarding I can get behind
Apr 22 18:44:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Imagine building a service with its own keys for using a blackbox backend key
Apr 22 18:45:22 <wasamasa>	imagine crowdsourcing api API keys
Apr 22 18:45:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Wonderful madness
Apr 22 18:46:28 <technomancy>	if you build a service on someone else's proprietary API you kinda deserve what you get
Apr 22 18:46:47 <bremner>	that's called enterprise software
Apr 22 18:47:03 <technomancy>	point stands =)
Apr 22 18:47:20 <bremner>	so true
Apr 22 18:47:38 <wgreenhouse>	(bitlbee can also toot to mastodon which is less b0rken)
Apr 22 18:48:01 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: I think that's thanks to our own kensanata
Apr 22 18:48:08 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: indeed!
Apr 22 18:48:09 <bremner>	there's also a dedicated emacs-client for masto
Apr 22 18:49:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Until they get rid of the backwards-compatible html-only mobile twitter, one can use html-parsers & requests.
Apr 22 18:49:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Once they do well.. screw Twitter anyway.
Apr 22 18:50:03 <wgreenhouse>	is rss2email still a thing?
Apr 22 18:50:08 <technomancy>	bremner: do you use that?
Apr 22 18:50:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: It's still in Debian at least.
Apr 22 18:50:40 <bremner>	technomancy: nope. I forget why not.
Apr 22 18:51:01 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: which doesn't exclude the possibility that it's an ancient heap of python2 code. but good to know. :)
Apr 22 18:51:18 <technomancy>	bremner: last I checked it hadn't been fixed to use non-blocking network calls
Apr 22 18:51:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	feed2imap also exists.
Apr 22 18:52:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: It's probably convertable without too much fuss.
Apr 22 18:52:21 <wgreenhouse>	in my ideal world this would be something that could operate directly on local maildir, rather than having to speak rss/atom at one end and imap at the other
Apr 22 18:52:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Nevermind that, all the deps are python3 on Buster
Apr 22 18:52:45 <wgreenhouse>	oh. nice :)
Apr 22 18:52:49 <wgreenhouse>	I'll check it out, then
Apr 22 18:52:52 <wgreenhouse>	possibly not totally moldy
Apr 22 18:52:53 <technomancy>	Let's start a change.org petition to replace IMAP with rsync+maildirs
Apr 22 18:53:20 <bpalmer>	never make sure it's not kerberized or anything.
Apr 22 18:53:22 <bremner>	Let's route tor over twitter
Apr 22 18:53:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: rsync+ssh+maildirs. I'm totally willing for that.
Apr 22 18:53:27 <bpalmer>	s/never/just/
Apr 22 18:53:36 <yeti>	git patches over email -> maildir :-Þ
Apr 22 18:54:31 <bremner>	git bundles over SMS -> raw oracle file systems
Apr 22 18:54:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	bpalmer: They'll just take it as a challenge and make it worse than it'd have otherwise been. At least ssh has not-completely-cancerous integration with krb
Apr 22 18:55:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And session multiplexing+keepalive can limit the annoyanc.e
Apr 22 18:56:39 <bpalmer>	bremner: will provincial fairs offer deep fried oracles?
Apr 22 18:56:55 <wgreenhouse>	rsync is suboptimal given maildir's reliance on moving files to indicated flaggedness; there have been a few attempts to make custom sync protocols around that. the confusingly similarly named maildirsync and syncmaildir, also one specific to notmuch users
Apr 22 18:57:06 <bremner>	bpalmer: I certainly hope so. 
Apr 22 18:57:12 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: anything's better than IMAP tbh
Apr 22 18:57:40 <wgreenhouse>	as a crazy person, I've thought of just using git or git-annex to do it
Apr 22 19:00:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Can't 'rsync -c' detect simple moves?
Apr 22 19:00:50 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: afaik no, it does not do that
Apr 22 19:01:10 <wgreenhouse>	that's why people wrote these things--bare rsync would involve resending an email just because it got flagged or moved
Apr 22 19:01:20 <wgreenhouse>	git can mostly do that if the only change was renaming the file
Apr 22 19:01:38 <wgreenhouse>	but tracking the full history of a maildir is possibly obsessive or wasteful
Apr 22 19:01:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah I see. I had been under the impression it would also do that, since it implies computing the hashes of everything before doing any changes.
Apr 22 19:04:42 <technomancy>	yeah tbh git+maildir would be even better
Apr 22 19:04:52 <technomancy>	the point is, maildir good imap bad
Apr 22 19:05:33 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: I'll let you know how it goes. still theoretically my plan
Apr 22 19:05:51 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: the problem is you have to convince service providers, or become your own mail host
Apr 22 19:06:41 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: right. near term it's meant as a fix for my desire to download all mail but still have multiclient access
Apr 22 19:07:02 <wgreenhouse>	but yeah, I'd love to be able to use git at arbitrary mail host
Apr 22 19:08:12 <bremner>	good news, github and gmail will merge soon
Apr 22 19:08:33 <apteryx>	any reason why this wouldn't work? https://paste.debian.net/1142226/
Apr 22 19:08:43 <bpalmer>	octopus merge?
Apr 22 19:09:07 <roadie>	bremner: excellent, do they come with office365?
Apr 22 19:09:11 <bpalmer>	apteryx: call-interactively, perhaps?
Apr 22 19:09:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	There's another benefit to the git thing. git-crypt + gpg = e2ee
Apr 22 19:09:22 <bremner>	roadie: only for imap access
Apr 22 19:09:26 <roadie>	cool
Apr 22 19:09:33 <bremner>	and DNS
Apr 22 19:09:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	No need for your host to ever know your mails.
Apr 22 19:09:53 <butterthebuddha>	There is an elisp function built into emacs that randomly makes some characters in the buffer uppercase
Apr 22 19:10:05 <butterthebuddha>	I can't emember what it is: does anybody know?
Apr 22 19:10:24 <wasamasa>	M-x plant-cat-on-keyboard
Apr 22 19:10:39 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I plan on using my account at rsync.net to have a git-remote-gcrypt backup of the mail
Apr 22 19:10:45 <apteryx>	ah, sorry, my paste was missing one defun: https://paste.debian.net/1142227/
Apr 22 19:11:14 <wgreenhouse>	in addition to local repos on all the devices where I read mail
Apr 22 19:11:24 <bpalmer>	apteryx: still missing more, unless it's a typo
Apr 22 19:11:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Ah nice.
Apr 22 19:12:20 <ldlework>	:O https://www.lumatone.io/
Apr 22 19:12:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Is there a functional limit to the number of unix accounts one can have?
Apr 22 19:12:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Like max(int32) or something.
Apr 22 19:12:59 <bremner>	less than that, I think
Apr 22 19:13:13 <wgreenhouse>	interesting question. probably depends on the kernel or the libc, no?
Apr 22 19:13:13 <apteryx>	bpalmer: what is missing? Seems to eval fine for me in *scratch*
Apr 22 19:13:16 <bpalmer>	some unixes used 15 bit user ids, so on a single host or administrative domain, that's your limit
Apr 22 19:13:25 <bpalmer>	apteryx: call-interactive
Apr 22 19:13:37 <bpalmer>	vs call-interactively
Apr 22 19:13:54 <npostavs>	butterthebuddha: studlify-buffer
Apr 22 19:14:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I guess no making a silly, simple user-ACL based server for mail intereop.
Apr 22 19:14:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Shame.
Apr 22 19:14:54 <apteryx>	bpalmer: ah! my bad, I thought it was 'call-interactive'
Apr 22 19:15:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: What about server2server communication in this scheme?
Apr 22 19:16:15 <apteryx>	bpalmer: eh, now it fails on (call-interactively #'xref-find-definitions), complaining about wrong number of args
Apr 22 19:18:25 <technomancy>	Aurora_v_kosmose: that already doesn't use imap
Apr 22 19:18:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	True. I'm not sure what it uses.
Apr 22 19:18:54 <technomancy>	SMTP
Apr 22 19:19:09 <apteryx>	bpalmer: https://paste.debian.net/1142230/
Apr 22 19:19:12 <wgreenhouse>	which is variously awful but hard to fix for all its various cases
Apr 22 19:19:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: Huh. Same things as client MTAs, I see.
Apr 22 19:19:41 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: technically client MTAs use a subset called the submission protocol of SMTP, usually
Apr 22 19:19:56 <wgreenhouse>	unless your MUA sits locally with your mailserver
Apr 22 19:20:05 <wgreenhouse>	submission provides for user authentication
Apr 22 19:20:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I see.
Apr 22 19:21:37 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: some crazy people also occasionally try to revive uucp, which is a peer-to-peer, store-and-forward protocol from the days of intermittent phone connections between hosts
Apr 22 19:21:51 <wgreenhouse>	there is uucp-over-ssh for xample
Apr 22 19:21:56 <wgreenhouse>	*example
Apr 22 19:22:00 <bpalmer>	apteryx: hm, I don't know. (call-interactively #'xref-find-definitions) evaluated in *scratch* works for me
Apr 22 19:22:50 <bremner>	rudybot: uucp over RDP or gtfo
Apr 22 19:22:51 <rudybot>	bremner: they're selling rdp
Apr 22 19:22:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: What's crazy about it?
Apr 22 19:22:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm unfamiliar with it.
Apr 22 19:23:16 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: it's built for a world where the hosts each keep a local record of how to reach their peers
Apr 22 19:23:20 <wgreenhouse>	i.e. pre-DNS
Apr 22 19:23:34 <wgreenhouse>	which makes it interestingly flexible, but maybe hard to scale up now
Apr 22 19:24:52 <wgreenhouse>	anyway most free software mailservers and news servers still support it
Apr 22 19:26:25 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I see.
Apr 22 19:26:25 <apteryx>	bpalmer: ah, silly me, I had args still to my defun but my (interactive) was not populating any.
Apr 22 19:26:36 <apteryx>	seems to work better now
Apr 22 19:26:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The resolution bit is probably the more complex part now.
Apr 22 19:26:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yeah.
Apr 22 19:28:57 <apteryx>	bpalmer: call-interactively is a keeper! Thanks for making me aware of it.
Apr 22 19:28:59 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: traditionally a uucp host has a list of peers where it says something like call this phone number, run this shell command, or wait for this host to call us
Apr 22 19:29:18 <wgreenhouse>	and you can also indicate that a host is reachable only via some other host
Apr 22 19:29:44 <wgreenhouse>	the transport can be almost anything which is interesting
Apr 22 19:30:27 <bpalmer>	,fidonet
Apr 22 19:30:28 <fsbot>	May the True Editor of hope fill you with great joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Apr 22 19:30:37 <apteryx>	bpalmer: the final implementation looks like this: https://paste.debian.net/1142237/
Apr 22 19:30:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I wonder if it can be safe in a public network.
Apr 22 19:30:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The arbitrary commands would need to go, unfortunately.
Apr 22 19:31:09 <apteryx>	err, https://paste.debian.net/1142238/
Apr 22 19:31:23 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: old school uucp is completely unencrypted, but the "run this shell command" connect option is why uucp-over-ssh can work
Apr 22 19:35:05 <wgreenhouse>	(arbitrary process as transport for the uucp traffic is separate from "run arbitrary process as destination" aka uux)
Apr 22 19:36:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm.
Apr 22 19:36:24 <wgreenhouse>	*at destination
Apr 22 19:37:34 <wgreenhouse>	i.e. I think you can have a uucp peer defined that reaches you via ssh or whatever encrypted tunnel, but then not allow commands to be run--just dump the mail for the host to deal with
Apr 22 19:37:49 <wgreenhouse>	and of course ssh itself can be configured to allow port forwarding but not commands
Apr 22 19:37:59 <wgreenhouse>	which is all that's needed
Apr 22 19:38:39 <wgreenhouse>	anyway it's an interesting relic which might be fun for you to read about. and the main uucp server out there is a GNU project. :)
Apr 22 19:38:50 <wgreenhouse>	gnu "taylor" uucp
Apr 22 19:57:02 <yeti>	hmmmm... uucp.el?
Apr 22 19:57:32 <yeti>	turn emacs into the greatest social net
Apr 22 19:57:48 <bremner>	but, but, there is already #emacs
Apr 22 19:58:54 <yeti>	I kind of miss fidonet... but *nix anf fido didnt match well
Apr 22 19:59:14 <wgreenhouse>	yeti: I've sometimes enjoyed the fantasy of a serverless nntp network using uucp over ssh (hell, maybe uucp over ssh over tor) to sync up newsgroups
Apr 22 19:59:26 <wgreenhouse>	1980s 2020 social network
Apr 22 19:59:42 <yeti>	something like that as start ...
Apr 22 19:59:54 <yeti>	uucp over some vpns... even onion space...
Apr 22 20:00:06 <wgreenhouse>	I don't know how many folks would enjoy running both inn and uucp to participate, though
Apr 22 20:00:35 <yeti>	there was a way to batch the news to some newsreaders
Apr 22 20:00:40 <yeti>	not everyone would need an INN
Apr 22 20:01:04 <wgreenhouse>	sure, right; uucp was how some people's newsreaders connected to their news server, too
Apr 22 20:01:13 <wgreenhouse>	which would give you a batch delivery of messages
Apr 22 20:01:14 <yeti>	but on the other hand, make the config in a well documented org file and pont at where to hit C-c C-c...
Apr 22 20:01:50 <yeti>	ok... and for points, even git over mail might be good enough
Apr 22 20:02:06 <wgreenhouse>	true.
Apr 22 20:02:27 <yeti>	and uucp can be put atop everything that smells like IP or a modem
Apr 22 20:03:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	[meshnet noises intensify]
Apr 22 20:03:09 <wgreenhouse>	yeti: yup, or indeed any device that spews a stream of characters, whether duplex or half-duplex
Apr 22 20:03:28 *	yeti likes to think of busses and trains as mobile nodes fpr fat file transfers
Apr 22 20:04:04 <yeti>	everything with a halfway reliable schedule could do the heavy lifting leaving other transports open for faster communication
Apr 22 20:04:38 <yeti>	every bus stop as accesspoint... ;-)
Apr 22 20:04:43 <yeti>	kind of
Apr 22 20:06:19 <yeti>	citadel still exists, does dialup and IP and maps everything to IMAP
Apr 22 20:06:39 <wgreenhouse>	yeti: interesting. I didn't realize that citadel hewed so close to its BBS roots
Apr 22 20:06:46 <wgreenhouse>	I basically thought of it as a groupware suite these days
Apr 22 20:07:57 <yeti>	tor wants(!) more users from the bright side of the net
Apr 22 20:08:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	yeti: That reminds me of that nncp project someone posted on here a few days ago.
Apr 22 20:08:38 <yeti>	that russian fido-next-generation thingy?
Apr 22 20:08:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yeah.
Apr 22 20:08:57 <yeti>	I think we have uucp and all other ingredients
Apr 22 20:08:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://web.archive.org/web/20190905045222/https://www.nncpgo.org/
Apr 22 20:09:07 <yeti>	modular
Apr 22 20:09:14 <wgreenhouse>	yeti: as a tor user I resemble that remark. %) I pitch tor to everyone looking for secure nat traversal and ways to self-host personal projects without dealing with much of the badness of today's hosting options
Apr 22 20:09:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	archive.org because valid https cert
Apr 22 20:09:56 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I do use Tor for similar reasons, among others. What remark was made?
Apr 22 20:10:03 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah
Apr 22 20:10:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I honestly think I2P is a better fit for NNTP.
Apr 22 20:10:42 <yeti>	meh
Apr 22 20:11:06 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Tor has worse traffic correlation weaknesses.
Apr 22 20:11:33 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I get bad smells off of the every-client-a-relay design choice of i2p. and tor's supposed traffic correlation issues are only worse in comparison to the completely unstudied risks of i2p :)
Apr 22 20:11:35 <yeti>	I want the weakest systems to be able to connect to each other
Apr 22 20:11:55 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: but we can save that holy war for another moment
Apr 22 20:12:29 <wgreenhouse>	i2p is fine in its niche, which is the torrent raffic that tor doesn't want ;)
Apr 22 20:12:33 <yeti>	I'm not looking at tor as security aspect... just as a worldwide vpn
Apr 22 20:12:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The winner of the holy war exists only on paper, unfortunately.
Apr 22 20:12:50 <yeti>	meow?
Apr 22 20:12:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Gnunet
Apr 22 20:12:56 <yeti>	aaah
Apr 22 20:13:07 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: yeah. :(
Apr 22 20:13:10 <wgreenhouse>	give that guy some grant funding
Apr 22 20:13:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	^
Apr 22 20:13:18 <wgreenhouse>	if there's any grant funding for anything like this post-covid
Apr 22 20:13:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'd contribute if well... I had any sort of qualification for writing proper crypto code.
Apr 22 20:13:55 <wgreenhouse>	and gnunet even had as one of its initial usecases newsgroup- or forum-like discussion groups, iirc
Apr 22 20:14:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Don't want to be the one person that screws it all up.
Apr 22 20:14:05 <wgreenhouse>	that was supposed to be one of the first deliverables along with naive file sharing
Apr 22 20:15:43 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's my vague, naive hope that the general awareness of FOSS and lack of pretense of non-maliciousness by big networks will lead to progress on that front.
Apr 22 20:16:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Online tracking has become obvious-enough for normies (yes I went there) to see it.
Apr 22 20:16:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	And its dangers. I'd refer to that news article about geofencing I linked a little while ago.
Apr 22 20:17:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Though that's more malicious devices one carries on oneself, but still. Tracking.
Apr 22 20:18:23 <yeti>	https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761
Apr 22 20:18:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That one, yeah.
Apr 22 20:19:06 <yeti>	hackaday++
Apr 22 20:19:17 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	hm?
Apr 22 20:19:23 <yeti>	they mentioned it
Apr 22 20:19:27 <wgreenhouse>	Briar is somewhat interesting in relation to all this. lacking a desktop client still but good ideas
Apr 22 20:19:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yeah, briar needs a desktop client. :/
Apr 22 20:21:49 <yeti>	why?
Apr 22 20:21:50 <fsbot>	why not?
Apr 22 20:21:55 <yeti>	:-Þ
Apr 22 20:22:18 <yeti>	imap + some frontends...
Apr 22 20:22:38 <yeti>	why invent every thing in an incompatible way to pre existing ones?
Apr 22 20:22:47 <yeti>	NIH syndrome?
Apr 22 20:22:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Laptops, Librem 5, Pinephone are all portable devices usable on the move which would benefit from resilient communications and which cannot natively use Android apps (afaik).
Apr 22 20:25:59 <wgreenhouse>	and running the android sdk or similar for the sake of briar would be a bit wasteful in terms of battery, etc.
Apr 22 20:26:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's also a no-go on any laptops without GPUs as far as emulation goes.
Apr 22 20:26:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Androidx86 runs badly on those.
Apr 22 20:26:55 <wgreenhouse>	interesting. integrated intel gpu/amd apu not good enough?
Apr 22 20:27:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Not in my tests with KVM paravirt.
Apr 22 20:27:49 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: ironic, given that the Google engineer dogfood solution to android development these days, aiui, is to run the android development stuff on one of the chromebooks that supports linux containers
Apr 22 20:27:58 <wgreenhouse>	and those machines pretty much all use intel gpu
Apr 22 20:28:11 <wgreenhouse>	maybe a subtle and terrible configuration problem
Apr 22 20:28:28 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Possible.
Apr 22 20:28:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I suspect it'd have worked fine if I gave PCI passthrough.
Apr 22 20:29:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	But that's essentially giving full access to memory unless the machine has working IOMMU so... I didn't.
Apr 22 20:29:44 <wgreenhouse>	the chromebook thing uses VirGL, I believe
Apr 22 20:29:49 <wgreenhouse>	which I know nothing about
Apr 22 20:30:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Same.
Apr 22 20:31:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It may also be Androidx86 itself that was doing something terribly inefficiently.
Apr 22 20:31:49 <bremner>	wgreenhouse: the imap-dl author was sympathetic to the idea of IDLE support. So if you wanted to work on that I think he'd be thrilled.
Apr 22 20:34:34 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm. I should see if it isn't the storage I ran it on. SO threads mention it for some proprietary emulators...
Apr 22 20:38:02 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: that's good to hear. that package/repo has other interesting goodies too, I see, of possible relevance to a user of notmuch and/or maildirs
Apr 22 20:38:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	IDLE?
Apr 22 20:38:43 <bremner>	no u
Apr 22 20:39:07 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: persistent connection to imap server/fast updates when there's new mail
Apr 22 20:39:22 <wgreenhouse>	surprisingly hard to find support for in *nix on desktop
Apr 22 20:39:30 <ober>	did they ever get a full elisp runtime on guile?
Apr 22 20:39:34 <bremner>	wgreenhouse: apparently imap-dl is _much_ faster than getmail in non-idle mode
Apr 22 20:40:02 <bremner>	ober: what counts as full? isn't that emacs?
Apr 22 20:40:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Emacs has a large part of it written in Elisp. Those parts aren't runtime.
Apr 22 20:41:10 <wgreenhouse>	ober: guilemacs (emacs with the elisp interpreter and some things that are normally C builtins reimplemented in guile) exists but is not very usable
Apr 22 20:41:27 <wgreenhouse>	it manages to be slower than elisp bytecode
Apr 22 20:41:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm, that's no good.
Apr 22 20:41:51 <wgreenhouse>	ober: gnu guix is the best way to try it
Apr 22 20:41:58 <wgreenhouse>	also the best way to try gccemacs
Apr 22 20:42:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	One wonders how it slows down that much, given Guile tends to be fairly fast.
Apr 22 20:42:14 <wasamasa>	it's as if I'm in a CS class again
Apr 22 20:42:29 <wasamasa>	and someone's asking "Why are compiled languages faster than interpreted ones?"
Apr 22 20:42:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wasamasa: Hardly. Guile compiles to bytecode which is faster than JVM bytecode often.
Apr 22 20:42:47 <wasamasa>	and you can feel the condescension about to come at them
Apr 22 20:42:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So why doesn't it run at least as fast in this case?
Apr 22 20:43:10 <wasamasa>	you cannot do such generalizations
Apr 22 20:43:30 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: the elisp byte compiler is crude but it has a head start of a couple decades optimizing for its narrow cases, whereas guile comes from a world without e.g. dynamically scoped variables
Apr 22 20:43:40 <wasamasa>	if you were someone doing VM tuning for a living, sure, I'd be inclined to take you seriously
Apr 22 20:43:57 <wasamasa>	because then I'd know you've taken a few of these apart and can accurately gauge their strengths and how they work
Apr 22 20:44:08 <wasamasa>	but these people tend to not use IRC
Apr 22 20:44:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm making this comparison based on programs of mine which I have observed their runtime.
Apr 22 20:44:20 <wasamasa>	yeah, no
Apr 22 20:44:57 <wasamasa>	I mean, for starters, we're talking about an implementation in C that's been optimized over decades and compare it to an implementation in guile that's relatively new
Apr 22 20:45:08 <wasamasa>	why do you even expect a fair comparison here?
Apr 22 20:45:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Yes, and that's a valid reason.
Apr 22 20:45:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I never said it wasn't. I specifically ask why.
Apr 22 20:45:26 <wasamasa>	you are at vastly different levels here
Apr 22 20:45:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That's exactly the sort of reason I was asking for.
Apr 22 20:45:58 <wasamasa>	one level is concerned with encoding data structures in pointers, the other chucks all responsibility to andy wingo's VM optimizations
Apr 22 20:46:17 <wasamasa>	figuring that out is easy
Apr 22 20:46:28 <wasamasa>	it's the kind of thing you discover as you idly ponder that CS class
Apr 22 20:46:37 <wasamasa>	figuring out how to do better isn't as easy
Apr 22 20:46:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's more the sort of thing you figure out when you take a first look at the codebase.
Apr 22 20:46:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Your CS class says nothing about how optimized or not a program is.
Apr 22 20:47:11 <bremner>	My CS class does!
Apr 22 20:47:18 <wasamasa>	it talks about interpreters and compilers at length
Apr 22 20:47:25 <wgreenhouse>	also (find-library "byte-opt") is a great read
Apr 22 20:47:36 <wgreenhouse>	jwz opining about making pigs fast
Apr 22 20:47:44 <wasamasa>	things like pypy are a miracle
Apr 22 20:47:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wasamasa: Note that I never asked why it isn't faster than C.
Apr 22 20:47:54 <wasamasa>	they are not the norm
Apr 22 20:48:25 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, it's not a generalized technology
Apr 22 20:48:46 <wasamasa>	and even those do not stand on equal ground with a well-written C program (for some funny definition of well)
Apr 22 20:48:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Native compilation is faster than bytecode for obvious reasons. Why some bytecode is faster than others is a different question.
Apr 22 20:49:19 <bremner>	nothing is obvious about VMs
Apr 22 20:49:28 <wasamasa>	I'd like you to ponder how self-hosting plays into this
Apr 22 20:50:27 <wasamasa>	guile wants to be in the same league as other scheme implementations and not to be known for being slow
Apr 22 20:50:50 <wasamasa>	but there's only so much a handful of hackers around Andy Wingo can do
Apr 22 20:51:45 <wasamasa>	another thing you can discover by idly pondering: mismatches in performance-critical code are deadly to performance
Apr 22 20:52:10 <wasamasa>	if something like hash tables or variable lookup or string processing are slower in your reimplementation for reasons™ than the original, it's not going to look good
Apr 22 20:52:26 <butterypancake>	The manual says guile is slower than other implementations so that you can modify the code on the fly, whereas other scheme's are more for static scripts
Apr 22 20:52:36 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Bottleneck optimization is familiar to me, yes.
Apr 22 20:52:53 <wasamasa>	that's not exactly an excuse given how highly dynamic languages like CL and clojure are
Apr 22 20:53:06 <hodapp>	other schemes like what, Gambit-C? I've never used the ones that are supposed to be able to compile down
Apr 22 20:53:10 <holomorph>	chezmacs save us
Apr 22 20:53:12 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 22 20:53:22 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	chickenscheme too
Apr 22 20:53:27 <bremner>	holomorph: itym racketchezmacs
Apr 22 20:53:40 <wasamasa>	I can't think of a scheme that's not inherently a mismatch for emacs' idea of text processing
Apr 22 20:53:51 <butterypancake>	I'm not defending it, I actually know very little about it. I'm very interested in guile emacs though as I feel like learning emacs lisp might be a waste as it's only good for emacs and nothing else
Apr 22 20:54:31 <wasamasa>	guile emacs doesn't mean you'll write your init file in guile
Apr 22 20:54:32 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Depends how much of your life you spend in Emacs.
Apr 22 20:54:46 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's a waste if you barely use Emacs, indeed.
Apr 22 20:54:48 <wasamasa>	it means that you'll gain an appreciation for the separation between emacs lisp the language vs emacs lisp the API
Apr 22 20:55:20 <wasamasa>	you don't need to know much about the language to customize emacs effectively, but you can spend inordinate amounts of time figuring out the API
Apr 22 20:55:48 <wasamasa>	guile won't fix that
Apr 22 20:56:13 <npostavs>	I think there's also the problem that guilemacs currently doesn't support dumping, so just starting up might take 30~60 seconds
Apr 22 20:56:18 <wasamasa>	yes, it does
Apr 22 20:56:37 <wasamasa>	and it's behind the current state of emacs for obvious reasons
Apr 22 20:57:02 <holomorph>	bremner: forgot about that!
Apr 22 20:57:02 <winny>	butterypancake: put one more down for racketchezmacs
Apr 22 20:57:08 <winny>	sorry, that was for bremner ^
Apr 22 20:57:43 <bremner>	every problem can be solved by adding more layers right?
Apr 22 20:58:01 <butterypancake>	What's racketchezmacs? Like guile emacs but do racket instead?
Apr 22 20:58:30 <wasamasa>	racket decided to choose chez scheme as its new implementation language
Apr 22 20:59:00 <hodapp>	whaaaa, so Racket isn't self-hosting?!
Apr 22 20:59:03 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: somehow I find all of this stuff deeply reassuring in ways I probably shouldn't
Apr 22 20:59:07 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: like, complacency-inducing
Apr 22 20:59:18 <wasamasa>	complacency is something different though
Apr 22 20:59:25 <wgreenhouse>	fair.
Apr 22 20:59:30 <wasamasa>	complacency is why the dog in the fire says "This is fine"
Apr 22 21:00:11 <wgreenhouse>	right. I just mean it is reassuring to hear that elisp is actually highly optimized for emacs, and decades of effort to make it not slow does matter
Apr 22 21:00:28 <wgreenhouse>	as made apparent by the so-far miserable failure of these alternative implementations
Apr 22 21:01:03 <wasamasa>	speaking of which, how does remacs do
Apr 22 21:01:03 <butterypancake>	I thought that guile emacs was supposed to be faster if it managed to succesfully byte compile
Apr 22 21:01:13 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: it does and it isn't
Apr 22 21:01:33 <wgreenhouse>	but I don't know how many of the actual developers ever claimed it would be
Apr 22 21:01:45 <wasamasa>	have people been satisfied by all the code they rewrote in rust so far?
Apr 22 21:01:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	http://gunshowcomic.com/comics/20130109.png Hardly complacency. I'd consider it more like trying to lie to yourself about things not being horrible because you lack alternatives.
Apr 22 21:02:49 <rpav>	but things being horrible without alternatives doesn't really change the situation .. there are still no alternatives
Apr 22 21:02:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Complacency requires legitimate acceptance.
Apr 22 21:03:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Resignation is different.
Apr 22 21:03:14 <rpav>	eh
Apr 22 21:03:51 <rpav>	i think the real problem is everyone is trying to reinvent the programmable text editor, rather than making it irrelevant
Apr 22 21:04:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Can you really make it irrelevant without somehow making text editors irrelevant?
Apr 22 21:04:39 <rpav>	it's like complaining about becoming complacent about how horseshoes are designed, and it's like .. ok, maybe, but i mean, that's not really the future
Apr 22 21:04:45 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	The question this begs is how do you even make text editors irrelevant?
Apr 22 21:05:01 <rpav>	a much more interesting question
Apr 22 21:05:07 <rpav>	think along those lines
Apr 22 21:05:08 <yeti>	emojicode!
Apr 22 21:05:15 <rpav>	emoji are still text
Apr 22 21:05:27 <yeti>	but unreadable
Apr 22 21:05:38 <yeti>	https://www.emojicode.org/
Apr 22 21:05:52 <technomancy>	I think that requires redefining "text" to be completely meaningless
Apr 22 21:05:53 <cvandusen>	That's okay, most people can't read 
Apr 22 21:06:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	heh
Apr 22 21:06:03 <yeti>	someday we wake up and all the kids are carving hieroglyphs in bitstone
Apr 22 21:06:44 <wgreenhouse>	there's this whole fan theory that the Star Wars universe is largely illiterate
Apr 22 21:07:07 <bremner>	based on the writing in the movies?
Apr 22 21:07:19 <cvandusen>	,sting

Apr 22 21:08:00 <rocx>	yeti: in a thousand years, archæologists will uncover a silicon tablet. they'll think it's an ancient pcb, but "💩🚫👌😑" is etched in the corner.
Apr 22 21:08:17 <wgreenhouse>	bremner: based on the general lack of typography on set ever except when a technician type person is doing something technical. and also the availability of ubiquitous droid translation/interpretation
Apr 22 21:08:45 <aidalgol>	The Star Wars universe is also tiny.
Apr 22 21:08:56 <wgreenhouse>	and it's generally a dystopia with extreme Gini coefficient, so illiteracy would track
Apr 22 21:09:05 <wgreenhouse>	Public goods are seemingly not supplied much by either Republic or Empire
Apr 22 21:10:26 <aidalgol>	There was potential for some interesting world building in that series, but Lucas was a lousy writer, and Disney is has no artistic integrity, so it'll never happen now.
Apr 22 21:10:59 <wgreenhouse>	aidalgol: the expanded universe which disney has largely burned to the ground still has some interesting lore in it, and they can't suck it out of my brain. :)
Apr 22 21:11:04 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: that theory held up really well until Rogue One
Apr 22 21:11:11 <technomancy>	that was my least favorite thing about that film tbh
Apr 22 21:11:22 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: too much text in Rogue One?
Apr 22 21:11:34 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: Well, look, I'm not *that* big a nerd.
Apr 22 21:11:37 <aidalgol>	Nerd.
Apr 22 21:11:45 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: no, just the implication of widespread literacy flying in the face of established canon
Apr 22 21:11:50 <technomancy>	"established"
Apr 22 21:11:57 <technomancy>	is a bit of a stretch there but =)
Apr 22 21:12:00 <apteryx>	can I define syntax (macros) in a lexical block? like in Scheme with (let-syntax ...)
Apr 22 21:12:01 <aidalgol>	Star Wars has canon?
Apr 22 21:12:04 <wgreenhouse>	technomancy: ah. hmm. I'll have to take note of that if I rewatch it
Apr 22 21:12:23 <aidalgol>	FTR, I lost interest after Return of the Jedi.
Apr 22 21:12:33 <aidalgol>	So I'm not really qualified to comment.
Apr 22 21:12:44 <aidalgol>	(Not that stops anyone in the internet.)
Apr 22 21:12:55 <aidalgol>	*on
Apr 22 21:13:22 <aidalgol>	Unrelated: I'm about ready to give up on The Fediverse™ again.
Apr 22 21:13:47 <wgreenhouse>	aidalgol: meaning mastodon? matrix? xmpp?
Apr 22 21:13:53 <butterypancake>	wait, going back to the guile emacs bit. The last known guile emacs was based on guile 2.2 which didn't do jit. guile 3 is supposed to be like twice as fast because it can jit now. If someone rebased guile emacs onto the latest guile, it might be faster than the current elisp engine? maybe?
Apr 22 21:13:59 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: Mastodon + Pleroma.
Apr 22 21:14:01 <holomorph>	aidalgol: there's a big one they called the death star!

Apr 22 21:16:29 <technomancy>	aidalgol: too unstable?
Apr 22 21:16:33 <aidalgol>	yeah
Apr 22 21:16:35 <wasamasa>	butterypancake: one of the problems I see with guilemacs is that you need someone proficient in C, elisp and guile to improve it
Apr 22 21:16:37 <lampilelo>	apteryx: cl-macrolet maybe? i've never used it, but sounds right
Apr 22 21:16:40 <aidalgol>	One day it kept OOMing, and I gave up.

Apr 22 21:16:53 <apteryx>	lampilelo: thanks
Apr 22 21:16:56 <aidalgol>	technomancy: It would not run on a pi.
Apr 22 21:16:58 <technomancy>	and then I read that it needs way more oooomph than a pi, yeah

Apr 22 21:18:29 <wasamasa>	it's a russian specialty to look for offensive terms in words

Apr 22 21:18:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Kotlin
Apr 22 21:19:11 <hodapp>	siiiiigh
Apr 22 21:19:14 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: the docking station I use with my rpi has one of boris's "Blin Inside" stickers (in the style of the Intel logo) on it
Apr 22 21:19:24 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	heh
Apr 22 21:19:41 <wasamasa>	I couldn't use kotlin at work without people thinking of the german word for faeces
Apr 22 21:20:14 <butterypancake>	wasamasa: well right now we need people who know c and elisp for the current implementation. byte code optimizations will be done by the guile project which will hopefully pull people from more than just emacs. The emacs folk will have to maintian the elisp definition. Assuming people come to the guile project from other sources (guix, gdb) which I get is a big if, than it would be easier to maintain.
Apr 22 21:20:54 <wasamasa>	butterypancake: wrong, you need to know guile to understand how to fix the pain points in its implementation of elisp
Apr 22 21:21:19 <wasamasa>	butterypancake: like the suboptimal implementation of strings
Apr 22 21:21:25 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: I think that's exactly backwards--there is a bigger pool of people optimizing theperformance of already existing emacs than guilemacs
Apr 22 21:21:44 <wgreenhouse>	so far at least
Apr 22 21:21:51 <wgreenhouse>	assuming emacs doesn't manage to alienate everybody as a project
Apr 22 21:22:11 <holomorph>	lol
Apr 22 21:22:35 <hodapp>	isn't that what it was meant for in the first place?
Apr 22 21:22:41 <wasamasa>	I hope that GNU projects don't alienate each other
Apr 22 21:22:58 <holomorph>	hodapp: it's the enemies we make along the way!
Apr 22 21:23:10 <hodapp>	holomorph: the real Emacs was in your heart all along.
Apr 22 21:23:36 <butterypancake>	I really thought guile was quite good. It looked really cool and I stated reading the documentation. Isn't guile like RMS's baby or something? Is it bad because Emacs is already super developed or is it bad because something is inherently wrong with guile
Apr 22 21:24:23 <wgreenhouse>	emacs is super developed and it's hard to naively replace a compiler with decades of optimization behind it
Apr 22 21:24:29 <wgreenhouse>	even if everyone loves to hate on said compiler
Apr 22 21:24:51 <hodapp>	couldn't we just get some grad students and make them rewrite Emacs for a term project?
Apr 22 21:24:53 <wgreenhouse>	also not having your existing apps work smoothly is painful
Apr 22 21:24:54 <wasamasa>	butterypancake: RMS very much likes the idea of guile, that's it
Apr 22 21:25:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	lol
Apr 22 21:25:12 <aidalgol>	See http://notinventedhe.re/on/2010-9-13 and the next few comics.
Apr 22 21:25:18 <wasamasa>	he also likes the idea of emacs competing with word processors
Apr 22 21:25:22 <lampilelo>	hodapp: you'd use something written entirely by grad students?
Apr 22 21:25:24 <noobly>	why are we rewriting emacs
Apr 22 21:25:37 <aidalgol>	he also likes the idea of deflowering "emacs virgins"
Apr 22 21:25:38 <tromey>	speed
Apr 22 21:25:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Well, anything capable of editing LaTeX & markup languages essentially beats word processors imo.
Apr 22 21:26:01 <noobly>	make sure to include continuous scrolling for pdf-tools in the rewrite
Apr 22 21:26:13 <butterypancake>	noobly: +1
Apr 22 21:26:15 <wasamasa>	he didn't understand the idea of replacing word processors with using late
Apr 22 21:26:15 <wasamasa>	*latex
Apr 22 21:26:33 <wasamasa>	at that point I realized that RMS is an ideological, not a technological leader
Apr 22 21:26:46 <butterypancake>	ya I was reading his email in dmacs devel. he wanted to replace libre office with emacs right?
Apr 22 21:26:53 <butterypancake>	that's pretty nutty
Apr 22 21:27:27 <noobly>	butterypancake: have you tried the emacs-application-framework pdf viewer?
Apr 22 21:27:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: I'm not sure he's even that anymore, with how out of touch he repeatedly shows himself to be.
Apr 22 21:27:39 <noobly>	i guess it has continuous scrolling, but EAF scares me
Apr 22 21:28:32 <butterypancake>	ya. I've steered clear of EAF. Mostly because I don't know anything about it. 
Apr 22 21:28:39 <wgreenhouse>	EAF is manateelazycat's crazy thing, right?
Apr 22 21:28:42 <wasamasa>	yes
Apr 22 21:28:44 <wgreenhouse>	he's been around a while, at least
Apr 22 21:28:55 <wgreenhouse>	I think he pitched that to #emacs at least 10 years ago
Apr 22 21:29:42 <wgreenhouse>	so I suspect he's not going away anytime soon doing this weird thing
Apr 22 21:29:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	So... what is it doing that's crazy?
Apr 22 21:30:08 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: basically it's a suite of pyqt apps that talk to emacs but are Qt applications
Apr 22 21:30:15 <wgreenhouse>	browser, media player, etc.
Apr 22 21:30:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Huh.
Apr 22 21:30:52 <wgreenhouse>	I think manatee created them as part of the chinese "linux-deepin" distro which he also affiliates with
Apr 22 21:31:12 <wgreenhouse>	so it's a whole weird little collection of software, of the kind emacs has always attracted
Apr 22 21:31:18 <wgreenhouse>	will exist even if all of us think it's crazy
Apr 22 21:31:26 <butterypancake>	but are they generic qt applications or do they have to be breed specifically for emacs 
Apr 22 21:31:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Huh, kinda neat.
Apr 22 21:31:43 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: aiui they're qt applications specifically designed for remote control through emacs
Apr 22 21:31:52 <wgreenhouse>	wouldn't be very useful in a non-emacs world
Apr 22 21:33:16 <butterypancake>	so it was too hard to make threads so he decided just to run two seperate applications with one controling the other?
Apr 22 21:33:27 <butterypancake>	seems, wrong
Apr 22 21:33:52 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: it's a fairly classic emacs design pattern :P
Apr 22 21:33:58 <bremner>	works for chrome
Apr 22 21:34:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Works with pretty much anything with a client vs daemon core.
Apr 22 21:34:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Which is generally a good pattern if you don't want to have to reimplement the core for every platform client.
Apr 22 21:35:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Keybase's chat client for example.
Apr 22 21:35:14 <wgreenhouse>	right. for this, you need emacs and you need qt and pyqt, which in theory are all pretty widely available
Apr 22 21:35:24 <wgreenhouse>	in practice I think the developer only cares about a linux host anyway
Apr 22 21:35:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Fair observation.
Apr 22 21:36:25 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	There's also something to be said for the inability of one process-node to crash every other one.
Apr 22 21:36:38 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	If you have supervision trees, you could even have automatic recovery to a point.
Apr 22 21:38:48 <butterypancake>	I fail to see how that different from a properly threaded application
Apr 22 21:38:59 <butterypancake>	but I do see how that could be cool for something like Emacs
Apr 22 21:39:48 <usr123>	I'm trying to setup java with lsp java. I already installed lsp-java wiht MELPA. I also ran M-x lsp-install-server and installed jdtt, I still don't get any autocompletion or error checking. I also installed lsp-company
Apr 22 21:40:29 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	butterypancake: Memory errors are less likely to screw up everything.
Apr 22 21:41:03 <Defolos>	wasamasa: thank you for your previous tip wrt to xsettings.c
Apr 22 21:41:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Otherwise yeah, it's kinda samey
Apr 22 21:41:13 <wasamasa>	Defolos: what did you find?
Apr 22 21:41:19 <Defolos>	wasamasa: emacs does indeed work without gconf just fine
Apr 22 21:41:24 <wasamasa>	ok, cool
Apr 22 21:41:28 <ldlework>	how do get emacs to treat TitleCase as two words?
Apr 22 21:41:33 <Defolos>	no need to use that deprecate dependency
Apr 22 21:41:34 <wasamasa>	what distro was this about again?
Apr 22 21:41:34 <ldlework>	for motion and deletion and everything
Apr 22 21:41:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Well, there's other more obscure details about vulnerabilities in processes but I'm not exactly knowledgeable in that field.
Apr 22 21:41:41 <Defolos>	wasamasa: Fedora
Apr 22 21:41:46 <tromey>	ldlework: see M-x subword-mode
Apr 22 21:41:55 <mehlon>	yo emacs
Apr 22 21:42:27 <wasamasa>	Defolos: I'm kind of surprised arch didn't run in this, I guess they've just let autoconf figure it out
Apr 22 21:42:29 <grym>	yemacs
Apr 22 21:42:42 <ldlework>	tromey: god bless you
Apr 22 21:42:48 <bremner>	,ymacs
Apr 22 21:42:49 <fsbot>	ymacs is [0] an Emacs-like editor that works in your browser: http://www.ymacs.org/
Apr 22 21:42:49 <fsbot>	[1] see vimjs
Apr 22 21:43:05 <mehlon>	emacs sounds like a gender neutral version of eboy/egirl
Apr 22 21:43:07 <butterypancake>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Single application aplications are probably more portable but I don't think threads are generally super portable
Apr 22 21:43:13 <Defolos>	wasamasa: it could also be that they still have gconf2-devel in the buildroot
Apr 22 21:44:18 <Defolos>	or it just went away and no one noticed, because nothing changed
Apr 22 21:45:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	butterypancake: That may have to do with it too. Less platform-specific concerns if you ignore the issue entirely.
Apr 22 21:45:20 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: client-server is a very prevalent elisp design pattern partly due to lack of threads but more compellingly due to lack of FFI (until lately); a lot of elisp that talks to a tiny server to do some library stuff. see e.g. pdf-tools, mu4e and notmuch.el, elim/garak
Apr 22 21:46:42 <wgreenhouse>	exwm, too, I suppose :)
Apr 22 21:47:06 <wgreenhouse>	though exwm does actually port much of Xcb to elisp and then speak it to the X server socket
Apr 22 21:48:32 <usr123>	any hep please?
Apr 22 21:48:40 <usr123>	help*
Apr 22 21:49:10 <wgreenhouse>	,ask
Apr 22 21:49:11 <fsbot>	Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help.
Apr 22 21:49:30 <butterypancake>	I think client-server stuff is cool. But I think it's cool because I can throw away part of it if i want. I can use and client I want talk to MPD. but the EAF feels like I couldn't easily replace either piece.
Apr 22 21:49:46 <butterypancake>	any client*
Apr 22 21:50:30 <mehlon>	,help
Apr 22 21:50:31 <fsbot>	help -- PM me and type help-erbot
Apr 22 21:50:52 <butterypancake>	EXWM is cool because it'l allowing me to put any graphical app into emacs. EAF only allowing very specific qt apps seems very niche
Apr 22 21:51:06 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: right. it also predates anyone daring to make exwm
Apr 22 21:51:11 <wgreenhouse>	but you could use the two together
Apr 22 21:51:33 <wgreenhouse>	since exwm still has some frictions between emacs ui and arbitrary X client ui
Apr 22 21:51:43 <noobly>	he already asked, he trying to setup java with lsp java. he already installed lsp-java wiht MELPA. he also ran M-x lsp-install-server and installed jdtt, he still don't get any autocompletion or error checking. he also installed lsp-company
Apr 22 21:52:03 <wgreenhouse>	oh, sorry
Apr 22 21:52:17 <butterypancake>	turn debug-on-error on? anything funny in the messages buffer? I have no experince with the software you're having trouble with
Apr 22 21:52:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm kind of curious about using EXWM
Apr 22 21:53:02 <butterypancake>	I'm using it now
Apr 22 21:53:11 <butterypancake>	it's kinda awful but I love it
Apr 22 21:53:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	lol
Apr 22 21:53:29 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I switched from stumpwm to exwm
Apr 22 21:53:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	What's wrong with it?
Apr 22 21:53:34 <wgreenhouse>	it is better and worse all at once
Apr 22 21:53:41 <noobly>	yeah exwm is awesome
Apr 22 21:53:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	both stumpwm & exwm, since I can get a comparsion
Apr 22 21:53:48 <butterypancake>	it's fun when you get a pop-up, which freezes the UI, so you have to force shut emacs losing all your work and you just get to sit there and be like, "oh, this is fun"
Apr 22 21:53:56 <ldlework>	^
Apr 22 21:54:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh. That's not cool.
Apr 22 21:54:07 <ldlework>	a variety of things will do this
Apr 22 21:54:41 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: re stumpwm: I love debugging and reconfiguring using emacs+slime; I hate some things that are wontfix, like the input boxes not handling non-Latin characters
Apr 22 21:54:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	ldlework: Known cause?
Apr 22 21:55:01 <ldlework>	Aurora_v_kosmose: it's single threaded I guess
Apr 22 21:55:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: :/ The non-English polyglot in me is annoyed.
Apr 22 21:55:16 <butterypancake>	using exwm I've actually only been frozen by gpg/ssh pinentry pop-ups. 
Apr 22 21:55:17 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: re exwm: debugging and reconfiguring in emacs is even better than using slime; otoh, process separation between my editing emacs and my WM might be nice
Apr 22 21:55:34 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: the fix for that is to use emacs for pinentry, which gpg2 lately supports
Apr 22 21:55:41 <wgreenhouse>	and don't use the menu bar
Apr 22 21:56:05 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: exwm itself is largely async but some of the historic window decoration code in emacs is blocking if you let it be blocking
Apr 22 21:56:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Why are input boxes non-UTF8?
Apr 22 21:56:27 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I think stumpwm is naively reading keycodes or something crazy like that
Apr 22 21:56:34 <butterypancake>	wgreenhouse: so, that only works if the INSIDE_EMACS environment variable gets propagated properly to the application that is making the prompt
Apr 22 21:56:35 <wgreenhouse>	there are also some interesting xmodmap symptoms related to this
Apr 22 21:56:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: And I suppose one can't simply disable all blocking?
Apr 22 21:57:03 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: disabling the menu bar helps, and in my experience using something other than ./configure --with-x-toolkit=gtk helps
Apr 22 21:57:16 <usr123>	wgreenhouse: I did, I installed lsp-java and I have a server connected, it just dones't give any autocompletion or error checking
Apr 22 21:57:51 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm... I wonder how much work it'd be to fix the stumpwm input code
Apr 22 21:58:04 <wgreenhouse>	usr123: sorry I missed your question. unfortunately I don't have experience with either lsp or company. my recommendation would be to make a minimum case reproducing the problem, i.e. maybe starting from emacs -q
Apr 22 21:58:16 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I have a maybe 7-year-old bug against it
Apr 22 21:58:32 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: the problem is they aren't using a real text editing library. which is where exwm is much better. :P
Apr 22 21:58:42 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Are any bugs being fixed?
Apr 22 21:58:47 <ahungry>	What are good setups for "jump to definition" in C/C++ code short of that large CIDE Emacs thing?  ctags? etags? lsp (does such a thing exist for C?)
Apr 22 21:58:56 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: others have been, sure. this one's hard
Apr 22 21:59:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm all for having a CL WM, but if it's nearly abandonware...
Apr 22 21:59:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Ah. I see.
Apr 22 21:59:44 <butterypancake>	ahungry: this is my c dev setup: 
Apr 22 21:59:45 <butterypancake>	(use-package xcscope
Apr 22 21:59:45 <butterypancake>	  :config (cscope-setup))
Apr 22 21:59:48 <technomancy>	I don't use stumpwm but I respect the dedication of someone who refuses to own a mouse to ensure their heart remains pure enough to maintain a WM
Apr 22 21:59:50 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: ah. I only use gnupg from emacs, in regular usage, I guess
Apr 22 22:00:17 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: maybe you could fake that environment variable from xinitrc? >:)
Apr 22 22:00:18 <ahungry>	thanks butterypancake I'll give that a shot
Apr 22 22:00:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I've been thinking of trackballs but they seem expensive. :/
Apr 22 22:00:48 <butterypancake>	ahungry: install the cscope binary too
Apr 22 22:01:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	technomancy: That's interesting. I find my keyboard-driven preference was actually induced by my use of tiling WMs. Shitty small screens, don't want to waste screen space.
Apr 22 22:01:31 <butterypancake>	wgreenhouse: if you tell ssh-agent to use gpg, and then do a push through magit, I get a popup
Apr 22 22:01:36 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: ideally something like stumpwm would use the existing, mature free software implementation of CLIM, but there's no such thing
Apr 22 22:02:11 <butterypancake>	wgreenhouse: however to sign the commit through magit using gpg, the pinentry works through emacs
Apr 22 22:02:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Interface_Manager This thing yeah?
Apr 22 22:02:27 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: right
Apr 22 22:02:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It's LGPL though?
Apr 22 22:02:46 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: McCLIM exists and is unusable
Apr 22 22:02:57 <wgreenhouse>	so stumpwm is just written in some quick hacks instead
Apr 22 22:02:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh, that's unfortunate.
Apr 22 22:03:13 <wgreenhouse>	I think stumpwm is in maintenance mode pending its ascension to CLIMness
Apr 22 22:03:36 <wgreenhouse>	my bug being one of those they were hoping would get solved by that
Apr 22 22:03:40 <usr123>	I get this error in *Messages* Error processing message (error "Keyword argument :end-column not one of (:buffer :checker :filename :line :column :message :level :id :group)"). [5 times]
Apr 22 22:03:41 <usr123>	 
Apr 22 22:03:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: So they're waiting on CLIM fixing the issue?
Apr 22 22:05:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Say, those Latin-only input boxes, what are they used for in stumpwm?
Apr 22 22:06:27 <butterypancake>	actually, I did fix the exwm gpg popup thing once. I think i set pinentry program to be pinentry-emacs so it literally couldn't do a popup. This is kinda like force setting the environment variable. The problem that happened that time, was that thunderbird did a popup telling me it was waiting to encrypt but I couldn't enter my password into emacs because of that popup. But if that situtaion occurs and the gtk pinentry pop
Apr 22 22:06:27 <butterypancake>	everything is fine
Apr 22 22:07:24 <butterypancake>	so basically if you're writing a program and it creates a pop-up. Stop. re-evaluate your life. You're doing something wrong
Apr 22 22:07:38 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: yeah, the gpg.conf setting should fix it
Apr 22 22:07:51 <usr123>	Okay, so it seems now every thing is working, but autocomplete is not working
Apr 22 22:08:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	butterypancake: Rather, it may be nice to have exwm properly manage popups.
Apr 22 22:09:00 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: it mostly does, except if the caller if emacs
Apr 22 22:09:03 <wgreenhouse>	*is
Apr 22 22:09:08 <wgreenhouse>	and emacs is hanging waiting for the response
Apr 22 22:09:46 <wgreenhouse>	as in the gnupg pinentry example
Apr 22 22:10:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Hm. Depends. If we mean ala pinentry, yes, that's rather cancerous. If it's like dmesg, it's okay.
Apr 22 22:10:13 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	erh...
Apr 22 22:10:15 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wrong name
Apr 22 22:10:25 <butterypancake>	I mean, I dislike pop-ups for more than just that. I like a clean tiling window manager where things stay in there tiles.
Apr 22 22:10:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	dunst -_-
Apr 22 22:10:43 <wgreenhouse>	exwm handles floating windows including popups just fine, including coercing them to be tiling if you want
Apr 22 22:11:04 <butterypancake>	nah, I set some setting that I want but has a warning that it makes pop-ups not work
Apr 22 22:11:12 <butterypancake>	I forget which one, but it's a setting I really like
Apr 22 22:11:24 <flypaper-ultimat>	butterypancake: you can force tiling if you (setq exwm-manage-force-tiling t)
Apr 22 22:11:41 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: the latin-only stumpwm input boxes are for things like e.g. changing the title of a window or workspace
Apr 22 22:11:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Keepassxc handles popups like they should. Previous versions created popups galore.
Apr 22 22:11:58 <butterypancake>	flypaper-ultimat: woah. thanks!!
Apr 22 22:12:01 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: or anything where the UI is asking you a question and you are typing a response
Apr 22 22:12:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(handling properly = displaying in the main window UI)
Apr 22 22:12:59 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: I see. So it wouldn't make firefox suddenly incapable of comprehending russian.
Apr 22 22:13:19 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: right. and it can even display a window's title that is Russian
Apr 22 22:13:25 <wgreenhouse>	you just can't type russian at stumpwm
Apr 22 22:13:31 <wgreenhouse>	you can type russian at the X clients, but not the WM
Apr 22 22:14:00 <wgreenhouse>	and this weakness of stump is a strength of exwm. you can actually make emacs the X input manager for the entire X session
Apr 22 22:14:09 <wgreenhouse>	and have just one setting to set to change input language
Apr 22 22:14:15 <wgreenhouse>	(assuming you like emacs's input methods)
Apr 22 22:14:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Emacs' input methods generally work nicely for me. I haven't tried kanji though.
Apr 22 22:14:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I suspect I may dislike that.
Apr 22 22:15:10 <wgreenhouse>	yeah, IDK how emacs's offerings compare to something like ibus that is used by more humans
Apr 22 22:15:15 <wgreenhouse>	for that case
Apr 22 22:16:10 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Huh, nevermind, it works fine.
Apr 22 22:16:15 <butterypancake>	oh, I wanted to figure out which setting was the one that made exwm not do pop-ups well. Turns out I misread a note in the wiki. It doesn't handle some pop-ups by default
Apr 22 22:16:58 <grym>	technomancy: oh no i have helm macros bound to keys now
Apr 22 22:17:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	wgreenhouse: Or at least, I get the same sort of input usage as I do with ibus-anthy.
Apr 22 22:17:19 <flypaper-ultimat>	butterypancake: i just entered the conversation, but i heard you talking about pinentry, do you have your loopback configured how you want it? I have the contents of  my ~/.gpg/gpg-agent.conf as allow-emacs-pintentry (newline) allow-loopback-pinentry, and in my initfile (setq epg-pinentry-mode 'loopback), and now whenever emacs needs my gpg key it asks for it in the minibuffer.
Apr 22 22:17:54 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: then that might be an appealing option that exwm has--to set input method once for everything, both emacs/exwm and its X clients
Apr 22 22:18:04 <wgreenhouse>	on a per-window basis
Apr 22 22:18:48 <butterypancake>	flypaper-ultimat: so, that only works if the INSIDE_EMACS environment variable gets propagated properly to the application that is making the prompt
Apr 22 22:19:36 <butterypancake>	 if you tell ssh-agent to use gpg, and then do a push through magit, I get a popup, however to sign the commit through magit using gpg, the pinentry works through emacs
Apr 22 22:20:58 <apteryx>	how can I make my global-set-key override a minor mode's key map? It seems to shadow it (perhaps because it is loaded after I define my key map).
Apr 22 22:21:04 <butterypancake>	you can force every application to use emacs by setting pinentry program to be the emacs pinentry but then you can still get the UI to freeze if you're using exwm, and also now you can't use pinentry outside of emacs
Apr 22 22:22:16 <butterypancake>	flypaper-ultimat: also slight nitpick: you forgot the (pinentry-start) bit. But thanks for showing interest :D
Apr 22 22:23:11 <flypaper-ultimat>	hmm, i dont have a pinentry-start in my initfile, still works though :S
Apr 22 22:23:12 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: clearly this setting is just trying to make you use exwm :)
Apr 22 22:23:55 <wgreenhouse>	apteryx: That's what minor mode keymaps do
Apr 22 22:23:58 <flypaper-ultimat>	*for within emacs, indeed with xapplications, it still does the popup
Apr 22 22:23:59 <butterypancake>	I guess I never tried it without that line. intresting
Apr 22 22:24:41 <butterypancake>	also, I recommend putting this line in your init as I think it help. It might not but whatever: (setenv "INSIDE_EMACS" emacs-version)
Apr 22 22:26:22 <flypaper-ultimat>	apteryx: you can define the key in that minor mode map, or you could add to the hook of that mode to define a local key with the function of that global key
Apr 22 22:26:23 <butterypancake>	flypaper-ultimat: This is the documentation I used to create my setup. It seems to think the (pinentry-start) line is important
Apr 22 22:26:26 <butterypancake>	 ;; To use, add "allow-emacs-pinentry" to "~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf",
Apr 22 22:26:26 <butterypancake>	;; reload the configuration with "gpgconf --reload gpg-agent", and
Apr 22 22:26:26 <butterypancake>	;; start the server with M-x pinentry-start.
Apr 22 22:33:45 <sm[m]>	g'day all.. would you know why dired won't follow the various links in ~/.nix-profile ? I can cd and ls, but not browse with dired
Apr 22 22:34:33 <flypaper-ultimat>	butterypancake: ah, there's actually a package called pinentry, i was just using the built-in epg. anyway i dont encounter situations outside of emacs that ask for my gpg password, (i use gnus for mail client for example), so im not bothered by prompts for it.
Apr 22 22:35:44 <ullbeking>	i have a dired listing of the same directory in two separate windows/frames/whatever.  in one i want default sortting of files, in the other i want to press 's' and get sorting of files by date.  but pressing s (`dired-sort-toggle-or-edit`) changes the order of files in *both* windows, which is hardly surprising considering they are showing the same bufer.
Apr 22 22:35:46 <butterypancake>	flypaper-ultimat: well my ssh example is actually from within emacs. I'm trying to use gnus because thunderbird sucks (for more reasons than it freezes my ui) but unfortunatly gnus doesn't support encrypting the subject line of an email :/
Apr 22 22:35:50 <apteryx>	bpalmer: still a bit rough, but this works for a tag finder that uses semantic, then ggtags, then xref: https://paste.debian.net/1142291/
Apr 22 22:35:53 <apteryx>	:-)
Apr 22 22:35:56 <ullbeking>	how can i get one dired window to sort by name, the other by date?
Apr 22 22:36:27 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: the magit thing sounds like a bug. magit should be making sure the env var is preserved 
Apr 22 22:36:45 <wgreenhouse>	If you directly called ssh from emacs it would be, I suspect 
Apr 22 22:37:13 <wgreenhouse>	But I do wonder about globally setenv'ing it
Apr 22 22:39:13 <butterypancake>	wgreenhouse: Well I'm doing a niche thing so I'm hesitant to open a bug report. See, I need to push through ssh but I'm telling ssh to grab it's ssh key from gpg and then gpg needs to grab a password from me. Ontop of this, I do set the environment in my init file which should propegate to sub processes automagically (I think?). So it might be a magit bug or an ssh-agent bug or a gpg bug
Apr 22 22:40:19 <butterypancake>	ullbeking: try this (customize-set-variable 'dired-listing-switches "-aFhl")
Apr 22 22:40:34 <butterypancake>	I forget what those switches do. I think one sorts?
Apr 22 22:40:49 <ullbeking>	-F i think

Apr 22 22:41:30 <ullbeking>	butterypancake: it seems none of these switches do what i need

Apr 22 22:45:40 <wgreenhouse>	They will be independent of each other this way
Apr 22 22:45:44 <ullbeking>	wgreenhouse: good idea, will try
Apr 22 22:46:22 <wgreenhouse>	Just confirmed, that should work
Apr 22 22:46:55 <ullbeking>	wgreenhouse: bingo!
Apr 22 22:47:03 <ullbeking>	ty wgreenhouse :D
Apr 22 22:47:30 <doomlist3>	hi
Apr 22 22:47:40 <doomlist3>	on ubuntu there is no window-swap-states cmd? why
Apr 22 22:48:14 <butterypancake>	what's your emacs version. It was added 26.1. Is that recent?
Apr 22 22:48:42 <butterypancake>	M-x emacs-version
Apr 22 22:48:53 <ullbeking>	i always compile my own emacs on any workstation or laptop i have as "my own" to settle down with
Apr 22 22:49:31 <butterypancake>	same. my version says 28 but I don't think that's been launched yet?
Apr 22 22:49:58 <butterypancake>	also it was mainly so I could put my dotfiles not in my home directory :P
Apr 22 22:50:43 <doomlist3>	GNU Emacs 25.2.2 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 3.22.21) of 2017-09-23, modified by Debian [3 times
Apr 22 22:51:18 <butterypancake>	yep. You need a newer emacs to use that function
Apr 22 22:51:34 <doomlist3>	so before that what did emacs users use
Apr 22 22:51:44 <doomlist3>	surely it had some function before that
Apr 22 22:51:51 <butterypancake>	that's a really good question
Apr 22 22:51:56 <doomlist3>	i know
Apr 22 22:52:30 <butterypancake>	the news entry literally just says this: 
Apr 22 22:52:31 <butterypancake>	*** New command 'window-swap-states' swaps the states of two live
Apr 22 22:52:31 <butterypancake>	windows.
Apr 22 22:53:59 <butterypancake>	I mean, if there was an older function, it's most likely deprecated and might be removed in future emacs. Is it at all possible for you to upgrade Emacs?
Apr 22 22:54:55 <wgreenhouse>	doomlist3: it just didn't exist outside of very numerous third party window management hacks
Apr 22 22:55:21 <wgreenhouse>	A common case of a problem that existed for a long time and was papered over with homebrew elisp
Apr 22 22:55:31 <butterypancake>	wait, what's a window? are we talking frames? I always forget
Apr 22 22:55:36 <wgreenhouse>	that waited a few decades for an official solution 
Apr 22 22:55:50 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: a window displays a buffer and goes inside a framr
Apr 22 22:55:50 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Frames are Emacs' x11-windows.
Apr 22 22:55:54 <wgreenhouse>	*frame
Apr 22 22:55:56 <doomlist3>	wha'ts home brow elisp
Apr 22 22:56:12 <butterypancake>	cool. Thanks
Apr 22 22:56:16 <wgreenhouse>	doomlist3: as in unofficial, third party fixes
Apr 22 22:56:49 <wgreenhouse>	doomlist3: thanks, I didn't know they finally fixed this officially 
Apr 22 22:56:53 <wgreenhouse>	Fun
Apr 22 22:57:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	An easy way to remember is 'c-h k' + ('c-x 5 2' or 'c-x 2')
Apr 22 23:27:04 <Twist>	My orgmode html export is suddenly failing with "org-html-table-cell: Args out of range: [left right], 2"
Apr 22 23:27:13 <Twist>	Is there any way to get a useful error?
Apr 22 23:30:22 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Twist: toggle-debug-on-error and read the stacktrace?
Apr 22 23:31:02 <Twist>	I tried toggling that on.. where should I be looking for said stack trace? Emacs just hung when I generated the error.
Apr 22 23:31:26 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Normally it pops up in another window.
Apr 22 23:32:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Twist: It'd be a buffer called *Backtrace*
Apr 22 23:34:10 <Twist>	Yeah.. I have no idea where that window is going. "Entering debugger..." appears briefly in the status bar, then emacs hangs.
Apr 22 23:35:07 <Twist>	Debugger does apppear in the menubar, but that's not super helpful with the UI locked up solid
Apr 22 23:36:06 <wgreenhouse>	C-g a few times to unhang thyself and then read the backtrace
Apr 22 23:37:41 <Twist>	Heh. Is 50 enough times? 
Apr 22 23:41:26 <ober>	guile is all about the jit
Apr 22 23:42:27 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Twist: esc-esc-esc
Apr 22 23:42:49 <bpalmer>	as of version 3, perhaps
Apr 22 23:43:39 <ober>	aye. and it's still slow af :P
Apr 22 23:45:42 <ober>	or changing benchmarks for competitors to make them slower to make it 'fair'.
Apr 22 23:45:43 <ober>	https://github.com/ecraven/r7rs-benchmarks/pull/45
Apr 22 23:47:21 <Twist>	oh, that's friggin wierd
Apr 22 23:47:36 <Twist>	the size of the emacs window seems to matter. If it's relatively small, the debugger appears.
Apr 22 23:48:27 <Twist>	Oh well. Fuck it.
Apr 22 23:48:59 <Twist>	Thanks for trying.. maybe I'll carve out some time to learn emacs debugging later, but it's not on the critical path tonight.
Apr 22 23:51:06 <Twist>	I found the malformed org table manually, but that's going to be less and less possible as the size of the org file increases.
Apr 22 23:52:01 <bpalmer>	benchmarking is hard, and benchmark comparisons harder.
Apr 22 23:54:30 <bremner>	,shopping everything
Apr 22 23:54:32 <fsbot>	Let's go shopping!
Apr 22 23:57:00 <noobly>	can someone help me with this super basic elisp problem? http://dpaste.com/3ESJR0N
Apr 22 23:57:50 <wasamasa>	but what is the problem?
Apr 22 23:58:07 <wasamasa>	a broken question mark key?
Apr 22 23:58:16 <noobly>	i thought it didn't work
Apr 22 23:58:23 <dale>	ober: Just how unsafe is "unsafe"?  Like "program will crash randomly 50% of the time" or "we find a bug every year or so but otherwise runs fine"?
Apr 22 23:58:41 <noobly>	actually it looked like it just did though, swear it was breaking everytime before the post
Apr 22 23:59:15 <wasamasa>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 23 00:01:34 <edgar-rft>	posting to #emacs solves all problems
Apr 23 00:02:02 <grym>	so about this vaccine then
Apr 23 00:09:55 <spikemaster>	using (cl-eval-when 'compile (require 'lib)) is harfmful
Apr 23 00:10:09 <ober>	dale: according to them, C is unsafe at any speed :P
Apr 23 00:10:23 <ober>	(car 1) segfaults
Apr 23 00:14:18 <dale>	ober: That does strike me as pretty unsafe.
Apr 23 00:14:54 <dale>	ober: But then maybe the suggestion there to run the benchmarks both with "safe" and "unsafe" settings is useful.
Apr 23 00:16:43 <ober>	yeap.
Apr 23 00:17:32 <dale>	Hm, MacPorts is behind on Guile and Chicken, that's too bad.
Apr 23 00:17:35 <ober>	but it won't help make guile faster
Apr 23 00:17:40 <offby1>	wgreenhouse: bpalmer: I did write something to get the latest kill from my console-mode emacs into my laptop's clipboard, but ... it is sooo  ugly

Apr 23 00:19:51 <offby1>	remember us little people
Apr 23 00:19:55 <technomancy>	I had an interview last week with someone from Bloomberg
Apr 23 00:19:58 <dale>	ober: I sense a lack of enthusiasm about Guile. :)
Apr 23 00:20:16 <offby1>	"Your lack of enthusiasm about Guile disturbs me"
Apr 23 00:20:17 <technomancy>	(the magazine, not the terrible former presidential candidate)

Apr 23 00:20:40 <offby1>	well _I_ knew what he meant
Apr 23 00:20:40 <bremner>	although one does own the other?
Apr 23 00:20:44 <offby1>	probably
Apr 23 00:20:49 <dale>	(ITYM the terrible media company not the terrible former presidential candidate)

Apr 23 00:22:28 <dale>	I remember Bloomberg as the news outlet who published apparently unsubstantiated claims that SuperMicro was shipping hardware with rice-grain-sized surveillance devices soldered on them.
Apr 23 00:23:26 <ober>	yeah they never recanted that did they?
Apr 23 00:23:28 <dale>	ober: Could you elaborate a bit on why that is?  I'm not very familiar with Scheme, beyond googling "which scheme should I use" every few months before I go back to Elisp.
Apr 23 00:23:36 <dale>	No, AFAIK they never retracted it.
Apr 23 00:23:52 <bpalmer>	Someday scheme questions will make it into the presidential campaigns
Apr 23 00:23:53 <ober>	clhs equivalents, except they are released more often.
Apr 23 00:24:23 <ober>	and are not 20+ years old. it's the latest round to try to add items to a standard that allow for non-trivial portable code
Apr 23 00:24:43 <aidalgol>	technomancy is now tainted.  He must be expunged.
Apr 23 00:24:49 <bremner>	does r7rs-big have a decent module system?
Apr 23 00:25:02 <bremner>	whatever decent means.
Apr 23 00:25:04 <dale>	ober: Oh, I vaguely know what R7RS is, I just didn't understand how the release of R7RS big would make it easier to pick a scheme implementation?  Is it something like everyone is going to support it?  Or only one or two implementation are going to support it, so the choice will become easier?
Apr 23 00:25:18 <ober>	that's a good quesion, I've only kept up on them as they are released.
Apr 23 00:25:26 <ober>	r7rs red, blue, etc.
Apr 23 00:25:47 <ober>	https://small.r7rs.org/
Apr 23 00:25:50 <dale>	I was just looking over Scheme implementations, in fact, and I'm not even sure how widely and completely implemented R7RS small is at this point.
Apr 23 00:26:25 <ober>	so stuff like postgresql drivers can be written portably
Apr 23 00:26:35 <dale>	Oh, OK, nice.
Apr 23 00:27:00 <ober>	yeah like chibi/gerbil, and a few others.
Apr 23 00:27:01 <bpalmer>	It feels like a lot of the touted benefits for scheme are now handled by things like lua
Apr 23 00:27:31 <ober>	well in the role of say a Bolt on Scheme, like Guile for existing C binaries sure.
Apr 23 00:27:49 <bremner>	I didn't know that was a scheme things so much as a guile thing
Apr 23 00:28:02 <bpalmer>	Well, simple; easy to embed; straightforward computation model.
Apr 23 00:28:05 <ober>	well guile was an extention language right?
Apr 23 00:28:13 <bpalmer>	What other benefits does scheme have?
Apr 23 00:28:13 <bremner>	it's cool?
Apr 23 00:28:18 <ober>	not being CL?
Apr 23 00:28:29 <ober>	hang out in #chicken-scheme for a while. nice group. happy people..
Apr 23 00:28:32 <technomancy>	continuations!!!
Apr 23 00:28:41 <technomancy>	but don't actually use them
Apr 23 00:28:47 <technomancy>	because they will turn your brain inside out
Apr 23 00:28:50 <bremner>	continuations are cool. I think I finally understand them after teaching them twice
Apr 23 00:29:00 <ober>	not a bunch of old ass ants in a queenless colony... awaiting their imminent dealth
Apr 23 00:29:23 <ober>	</badenglish>
Apr 23 00:29:41 <bpalmer>	bremner: you should have just taught them once, but taken a break in the middle
Apr 23 00:29:51 <dale>	Was that a dig at CL?  Or at #emacs?
Apr 23 00:30:03 <technomancy>	yeah tbh the appeal of racket is definitely not the simplicity or the embeddability, it's the availability of cross-platform libraries without the nasty memory/startup-time issues of clojure
Apr 23 00:30:06 <dale>	Are we the ants?
Apr 23 00:30:14 <bremner>	rudybot: what is an ass-ant? that seems like a bad thing
Apr 23 00:30:19 <rudybot>	bremner: Hows Emacs integration with tla? I'm assuming fairly good? (I got an ant up my ass to learn it...)
Apr 23 00:30:34 <bremner>	well. there you go. ass-ants are thing. TIL
Apr 23 00:30:39 <bpalmer>	ah, arch.
Apr 23 00:30:53 <ober>	dale: no, I'm referring to #lisp
Apr 23 00:30:54 <bpalmer>	I had allowed bzr to subsume those memories.
Apr 23 00:31:11 <dale>	bpalmer: Oh, and here I just assumed it was referring to TLA+.  Your reading is funnier.
Apr 23 00:31:17 <ober>	those that dared defy uncle john to label Their os as 'Lisp'
Apr 23 00:32:46 <butterthebuddha>	Hello. I
Apr 23 00:32:57 <butterthebuddha>	'm struggling with fuzzy text with pdf-tools on macos
Apr 23 00:33:29 <butterthebuddha>	the text gets less fuzzy if I zoom in, so it seems like it should be a fixable problem
Apr 23 00:33:53 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Are you using Mitsuharu's unofficial Mac port, or the official NeXTStep port?
Apr 23 00:34:10 <butterthebuddha>	I built emacs off of master, so I'm assuming official
Apr 23 00:34:44 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Are you on a Retina/high DPI display?
Apr 23 00:34:54 <butterthebuddha>	yep
Apr 23 00:35:19 <dale>	butterthebuddha: To my knowledge, NS Emacs doesn't support high DPI stuff.  You need the unofficial Mac port or Aquamacs for that.
Apr 23 00:36:31 <butterthebuddha>	there seem to be various different ports floating around, and I'm not sure which one is best
Apr 23 00:36:49 <dale>	butterthebuddha: I'm not sure there is a consensus on "best".
Apr 23 00:40:44 <dale>	butterthebuddha: https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/issues/51 and https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools/pull/469 seem relevant.  They suggest use of variable pdf-view-use-scaling, but I think you still need the unofficial Mac port for that to do anything.
Apr 23 00:41:14 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Personally I read all that and just went back to using Preview to read PDFs.
Apr 23 00:43:30 <bremner>	switching to linux / X11 also fixes the fuzzyness :P
Apr 23 00:45:21 <dale>	Really?  Does something in that stack of software let Emacs know about DPI?
Apr 23 00:45:34 <butterthebuddha>	hmm are there any plans for high-DPI support to land in mainline?
Apr 23 00:46:01 <bremner>	dale: no idea. Probably I don't understand the problem, but I only ever see mac users complaining about it
Apr 23 00:46:53 <bpalmer>	linux users have much bigger things to complain about.
Apr 23 00:47:23 <bremner>	heh. that could be.
Apr 23 00:47:43 <bremner>	especially know that a given day involves skype, webex, and MS teams
Apr 23 00:48:15 <technomancy>	bremner: I finally uninstalled zoom off my work laptop after the latest stuff came out about the installer and now I run it only from this janky chromebook
Apr 23 00:48:44 <bremner>	I just use android for that. I mean, all hope is lost there anyway
Apr 23 00:48:48 <dale>	For pdf-tools and Emacs to be non-jagged on macOS, I believe pdf-tools would need to generate rasters of its pages at e.g. 2x resolution, then hand the raster off to the macOS-specific APIs to draw the image, so that macOS can handle drawing it onto a 1.5x/2x/whatever scaled display.
Apr 23 00:49:05 <technomancy>	bremner: I did that but it chews thru the battery so fast, and it's annoying to hold it up while plugged in
Apr 23 00:49:07 <dale>	Whereas right now I think Emacs basically just bit blasts the raster itself.
Apr 23 00:49:27 <technomancy>	bremner: TBH I think even when plugged in, the net battery charge was negative during zoom calls
Apr 23 00:49:52 <technomancy>	rudybot: raster blaster
Apr 23 00:49:52 <rudybot>	technomancy: fancies a pan galactic gargle blaster
Apr 23 00:50:04 <bremner>	technomancy: yeah. I have a bit from ali-express order to hold my phone. So lame.
Apr 23 00:50:06 <dale>	I have no idea how any of that works on Linux/X11.  I think it's possible somehow.
Apr 23 00:50:44 <technomancy>	bremner: I still have the last pre-USB-C nexus so probably that's why the charging current isn't enough
Apr 23 00:51:14 <technomancy>	I've also read that charging the battery while it's hot is pretty bad for the life of the cells tho
Apr 23 00:51:39 <bremner>	technomancy: ah. I have new USB-c moto g7. Which is annoying in some ways, but charges wicked fast
Apr 23 00:59:52 <bpalmer>	rudybot: even the unix haters had to admit, Suns boot really fast.
Apr 23 00:59:53 <xristos>	butterthebuddha: if you're on macOS and want to take advantage of multiple macOS-only features, you need to use Emacs mac port, and not the official Emacs (or emacsformacosx)
Apr 23 00:59:54 <rudybot>	bpalmer: C-f to "pros and cons of suns" http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/unix-haters/preface.html
Apr 23 01:03:35 <ober>	oh that Sitcom, Stanford and Sun?
Apr 23 01:24:06 <butterthebuddha>	Yep emacs-mac fixed it
Apr 23 01:24:14 <butterthebuddha>	very happy with this
Apr 23 01:24:53 <butterthebuddha>	continuous scroll doesn't seem to be working using the mouse though

Apr 23 02:41:33 <JordiGH>	If I do form.save(), will the bar field also be saved like normal?
Apr 23 02:41:51 <butterthebuddha>	Just wondering if this guide still applies: https://github.com/nilcons/emacs-use-package-fast
Apr 23 02:42:12 <JordiGH>	Crap, wrong channel.
Apr 23 02:42:13 <JordiGH>	Sorry.
Apr 23 02:42:26 <JordiGH>	I was wondering why it was so lively in here.
Apr 23 02:45:08 <ober>	you clearly did not see same mistake with "can a foreskin be too long?" question
Apr 23 02:46:02 <lhx>	ober: didn't expect to see "foreskin" when dropping in. LOL
Apr 23 02:48:12 <hodapp>	...
Apr 23 02:48:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	kek
Apr 23 02:56:05 <wgreenhouse>	butterthebuddha: the approach remains sound; use-package now takes care of some of the pitfalls itself (such as load-path setup, cf. https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/README.md#extending-the-load-path )
Apr 23 03:08:04 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: Is that... Objective C?
Apr 23 03:10:54 <hodapp>	it's Objectivist C.
Apr 23 03:12:28 *	edgar-rft makes his own Subjective C
Apr 23 03:13:34 <JordiGH>	aidalgol: Python. Btw, where ya been?
Apr 23 03:13:41 <JordiGH>	You disappeared from my other hangouts.
Apr 23 03:14:14 <aidalgol>	Hiding from ornery people.

Apr 23 03:14:36 <aidalgol>	twitch weirded me out finally.
Apr 23 03:14:40 <aidalgol>	oof, burn.
Apr 23 03:16:12 <JordiGH>	Okay, fine, Twitch, whatevs. What about masto?
Apr 23 03:16:32 <aidalgol>	ugh, I'm growing tired of The Fediverse™
Apr 23 03:18:12 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Too many social outlets gets exhausting?
Apr 23 04:04:01 <butterthebuddha>	pdf-tools is behaving a bit weirdly for me
Apr 23 04:04:14 <butterthebuddha>	When scrolling up, continuous scroll works as expected
Apr 23 04:04:37 <butterthebuddha>	but when scrolling down, the page I'm on currently scrolls out of the frame and then reppears
Apr 23 04:04:52 <butterthebuddha>	pdf-tools never moves on to the next paeg
Apr 23 04:22:51 <catacombs>	proud moment: i finally figured out how to get emacs --daemon working probably on my mac.
Apr 23 04:23:01 <catacombs>	now i can launch it super quickly via alfred
Apr 23 04:45:55 <Samo_svoj>	slightly off-topic - how to establish new usenet group (either as a top level, or as some other level) and how to restrict access to it? (i would like to use news group as text-only version of modern web forums)
Apr 23 04:47:33 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Afaik that's instance-specific and something requiring admin intervention.
Apr 23 04:50:03 <Samo_svoj>	Aurora_v_kosmose: if I establish my own usenet server?
Apr 23 04:51:53 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	No idea. I presume it's whitelists & peering only with servers using the same whitelists.

Apr 23 05:29:18 <codingquark>	Good morning!
Apr 23 05:36:10 <aidalgol>	Usenet is dying a slow, sad death.  Don't try starting anything new there.
Apr 23 05:36:39 <aidalgol>	Maybe your own NNTP server, but not Usenet.
Apr 23 05:37:01 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	They were probably conflating the terms.
Apr 23 05:38:28 <codingquark>	Surely nobody will use gnus after Usenet dies.
Apr 23 05:39:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Eh... I wouldn't say that. NNTPchan exists. And I'd rather like having NNTP forums on darknets.
Apr 23 05:40:24 <aidalgol>	nntpchan?
Apr 23 05:41:44 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Federating imageboard madness.
Apr 23 05:41:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://github.com/majestrate/nntpchan
Apr 23 05:42:11 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	oh, it got derezzed. Well that's not cool

Apr 23 05:42:27 <fsbot>	yoda-phrases: [0/33] Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.

Apr 23 05:42:30 <ryouma>	,derez
Apr 23 05:42:31 <fsbot>	I need a little more detail please. 
Apr 23 05:43:08 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=derezzed
Apr 23 05:43:38 <ryouma>	is it anything more than spammers that killed usenet?
Apr 23 05:44:18 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	More easily accessible websites and spam, afaik.
Apr 23 05:44:55 <codingquark>	NNTP forums of darknet is a good thing, okay.
Apr 23 05:45:11 <Samo_svoj>	I think usenet can be very usefull for lots of things.
Apr 23 05:45:31 <aidalgol>	Samo_svoj: Such as...?
Apr 23 05:45:34 <codingquark>	_Is_ it?
Apr 23 05:45:53 <aidalgol>	codingquark: Certainly better than phpBB.
Apr 23 05:45:55 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Easier to trust plaintext payloads than more complex ones.
Apr 23 05:46:25 <ryouma>	usenet was a delight compared to today's most of web
Apr 23 05:46:29 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Um... those two thins are unrelated.
Apr 23 05:46:36 <Samo_svoj>	first, I do not like darknet. I like clean things :)
Apr 23 05:46:37 <ryouma>	whether nn or readnews or gnus or whatever
Apr 23 05:46:49 <homerj>	usenet is for piracy
Apr 23 05:46:51 <ryouma>	,darknet
Apr 23 05:46:53 <fsbot>	hmm, darknet is [0] One of various possible things: 1) A network with no actual machines on it, used primarily for internet monitoring or honeypots; 2) a "secret" network that spans the internet; 3) a private (file sharing) network where connections are only made between trusted users; 4) any part of the internet used for criminal activity
Apr 23 05:46:54 <fsbot>	[1] see also deepweb
Apr 23 05:47:05 <Samo_svoj>	aidalgol: for software development coordination.... for disucssion ... for decision making....
Apr 23 05:47:09 <homerj>	you get your .nzb file
Apr 23 05:47:14 <homerj>	download some stuff
Apr 23 05:47:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: @ News vs Gnus?  I had been asking, because I can't find any reference to "News" as some Emacs package
Apr 23 05:47:37 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: what?
Apr 23 05:47:44 <aidalgol>	Samo_svoj: Literally none of that happens on usenet anymore.
Apr 23 05:47:49 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: I'm unsure what you response is about.
Apr 23 05:47:59 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I wasn't responding to you.
Apr 23 05:48:07 <aidalgol>	oh, right...
Apr 23 05:48:11 <homerj>	usenet is a throwback from when everything had its own protocol
Apr 23 05:48:12 <Samo_svoj>	aidalgol: I know. But that is not good.
Apr 23 05:48:13 <homerj>	and wasn't all http
Apr 23 05:48:20 <ryouma>	my isp had an nntp server until, idk, 12y ago
Apr 23 05:48:25 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: Aurora_v_kosmose: Um... those two thins are unrelated. | That looks kind of like pinging me.
Apr 23 05:48:27 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I meant plaintext vs complex.
Apr 23 05:48:50 <homerj>	it's all uuencoded anyways
Apr 23 05:48:52 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: NNTP content requires less parsing than HTML from some random site.
Apr 23 05:49:08 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Whether it is plaintext or not is unrelated to its complexity.
Apr 23 05:49:31 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Insofar as things can break to allow RCE on a client? yes.
Apr 23 05:49:33 <aidalgol>	That term means unencrypted, not "simple".
Apr 23 05:49:38 <Samo_svoj>	emacs + gnus + malierx + ERC and you do not need anything else
Apr 23 05:49:51 <codingquark>	Since HTTP allows better communication by giving more ways to express, for those who do not want to trust such websites should sandbox their browsers.
Apr 23 05:49:58 <ryouma>	shar files instead of github!
Apr 23 05:50:34 <ryouma>	,malierx
Apr 23 05:50:36 <fsbot>	Exercise caution in your daily affairs.
Apr 23 05:50:44 <aidalgol>	I'll leave you lot to your nostalgia wanking
Apr 23 05:50:49 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Why only rely on one layer of security? A sandbox can break. Limit attack surface and sandbox.
Apr 23 05:50:55 <ryouma>	more like longing
Apr 23 05:51:08 <codingquark>	I have worked with people writing router firmware, without using git etc. Once the build is deleted, it is gone (unless it was backed up on a server)
Apr 23 05:51:44 <aidalgol>	ryouma: "Old times so much better than now.  Damn kids and new tech!"
Apr 23 05:52:15 <ryouma>	ok change of subject.  did git win because of its creator and fanboys?  or on technical merits?
Apr 23 05:52:47 *	ryouma is using a vga monitor
Apr 23 05:53:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	New LCD monitors use less power, lower electricity bills.
Apr 23 05:53:11 *	ryouma which is not better
Apr 23 05:53:11 <homerj>	neither
Apr 23 05:53:14 <codingquark>	VGA is a good port. What's the max res it can do?
Apr 23 05:53:37 <ryouma>	lcd monitors suck.  a lot.  but vga lcd monitors do not suck less.
Apr 23 05:53:59 <ryouma>	   1920x1080     60.00*+
Apr 23 05:54:09 <codingquark>	Not bad at all
Apr 23 05:54:13 <Samo_svoj>	aidalgol: Nobody says old things are better. Old things are good enough to be used and very simple and cheap.
Apr 23 05:54:23 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	LED & oLED are expensive.
Apr 23 05:54:30 <ryouma>	Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192
Apr 23 05:54:34 <homerj>	Samo_svoj, like codingquark's mama
Apr 23 05:54:42 <codingquark>	Wait why me
Apr 23 05:54:42 <homerj>	old, simple, used, and very cheep
Apr 23 05:54:50 <ryouma>	at my dpi or something it really sucks because websites assume i have more pixels than i do thus requirign horizontal scrolling
Apr 23 05:55:17 <homerj>	codingquark, first up on the complete nick
Apr 23 05:55:40 <ryouma>	i want a 32 inch monitor with a MINIMUM brightness of 1 nit
Apr 23 05:55:46 <ryouma>	and no higher
Apr 23 05:55:48 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	In some cases, new things are more complex to expose more features. That may be desirable or not depending on the use-case. In a use-case where you don't necessarily trust the source, reducing features & complexity to a minimum is desirable.
Apr 23 05:55:50 <codingquark>	Time to deliver a payload that changes your completion algorithm. Bet your OLD TECH could not do THAT!
Apr 23 05:55:52 <Samo_svoj>	aidalgol: git is not and was not the best solution but marketing did it. you can write much beter version control
Apr 23 05:56:25 <codingquark>	Aurora_v_kosmose: now I can say yes to that
Apr 23 05:58:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	codingquark: Common Lisp has been capable of live code updates since forever. :p
Apr 23 05:59:31 <codingquark>	Don't bring my emacs in this mess!
Apr 23 05:59:38 <codingquark>	I shall not tolerate that
Apr 23 05:59:41 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	heh
Apr 23 06:00:17 <codingquark>	You might ask how's CL related to Emacs, but I know it was only a few steps from CL that you reach Emacs.
Apr 23 06:07:14 <codingquark>	On a 15' monitor, it is amazing that I can make 3 windows and everything mostly fits
Apr 23 06:07:27 <codingquark>	Except code because nobody writes in short lines anymore
Apr 23 06:09:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Either you scroll vertically or horizontally. There's no winning move.
Apr 23 06:10:22 <codingquark>	Well said
Apr 23 06:26:38 <ryouma>	15 foot monitor sounds good to me
Apr 23 06:29:38 <inkbottle>	I write in short lines: at least I scroll in only one direction
Apr 23 06:30:00 <inkbottle>	15 foot is good size for a monitor
Apr 23 06:37:56 <ryouma>	i write in short lines also
Apr 23 06:38:43 <ryouma>	elisp aligns stuff well
Apr 23 06:45:52 <noobly>	1 and l look to similar, how do i fix this
Apr 23 06:46:40 <ryouma>	new font i guess.  dunno if you can fix individual glyphs?
Apr 23 06:47:24 <ryouma>	l1|I wow I and l look identical in deja vu sans mono which i really like
Apr 23 06:47:36 <ryouma>	:(
Apr 23 06:48:04 <noobly>	close that hanging paren :)
Apr 23 06:48:36 <ryouma>	you just did
Apr 23 06:48:50 <Cairn[m]>	Hey friends. global-unset-key doesn't touch Info keybinds, apparently? How might I use different Info keybinds?
Apr 23 06:49:17 <ryouma>	it should
Apr 23 06:49:27 <noobly>	,hi
Apr 23 06:49:28 <fsbot>	안녕하세요 noobly)
Apr 23 06:49:42 <ryouma>	Cairn[m]: local-unset-key
Apr 23 06:49:52 <ryouma>	or define-key
Apr 23 06:50:50 <ryouma>	what is the number of glyphs in hangul?  if it is not huge then its feature of glyphs within glyphs is not that useful.  right?
Apr 23 06:50:58 <ryouma>	what makes it good then?
Apr 23 06:51:13 <Cairn[m]>	Well local worked, it seems. But I'll check out define-key
Apr 23 06:53:02 <ryouma>	it is the general purpose one.  no need for the others
Apr 23 06:55:15 <Cairn[m]>	Alright, thanks for telling me
Apr 23 06:57:04 <ryouma>	i wouuld think a good script would have distinguishable glyphs unlike l and I for example, rather than just including consonants and vowels
Apr 23 06:57:32 <ryouma>	let's invent a new script for english
Apr 23 07:11:33 <iqubic>	Where is it that I can go to ask for help with EXWM?
Apr 23 07:13:55 <ryouma>	here probably
Apr 23 07:14:07 <ryouma>	but um that was a useless comment
Apr 23 07:17:16 <iqubic>	So, I have an graphical application, and it spawns external windows. I'd like those windows to be created as floating windows, instead of what's happening now, which is to make the new windows take up the entire screen.
Apr 23 07:17:24 <iqubic>	How can I make that happen?
Apr 23 07:19:56 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: you can toggle them to be floating manually. You can also use a hook so that they become floating when e.g. a particular window name or class is matched
Apr 23 07:20:33 <iqubic>	I'll need to create a hook to do this for me.
Apr 23 07:21:04 <iqubic>	But I have no idea how to do that.
Apr 23 07:21:18 <iqubic>	Which is what I was asking about.
Apr 23 07:22:07 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: And in a lot of cases, old things are less secure, buggier, harder to use, and harder to fix.
Apr 23 07:24:06 <ryouma>	economists seem to have consensus
Apr 23 07:24:20 <ryouma>	the pandemic will lead to inflation.  and/or deflation.
Apr 23 07:24:56 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki has an example of forcing a given window title to be floating, using the `exwm-manage-configurations' variable
Apr 23 07:24:56 <ryouma>	or maybe it won't have either effect?  let's make sure economists predict every possibility
Apr 23 07:25:46 <iqubic>	wgreenhouse: That's excellent, but I'd love it if I could do something like that, but for a specific window class
Apr 23 07:26:05 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: you can match on classes too
Apr 23 07:26:15 <iqubic>	Cool. I'll look into that.
Apr 23 07:27:21 <feannag>	Anyone here has some experience with gpg?
Apr 23 07:28:56 <iqubic>	Now, how the hell do I get the WM_CLASS of a window?
Apr 23 07:32:09 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: xprop
Apr 23 07:32:31 <iqubic>	Thanks. I'll look into it.
Apr 23 07:34:48 <ayuce>	feannag: what kind of experience?
Apr 23 07:39:00 <feannag>	ayuce, well, i have a couple of files encrypted using gpg with the same passphrase. But one of isn't getting decrypted. It returns "decryption failed: bad session key"
Apr 23 07:39:20 <feannag>	ayuce, brb
Apr 23 07:47:17 <wgreenhouse>	ryouma: one consensus that's pretty interesting is that the crash is due to the uncontrolled nature of the pandemic, and not due to any policy response. Places without any lockdown are still in recession because individuals still have to decide to weigh the risk and are determining it not worth it, en masse
Apr 23 07:48:20 <wgreenhouse>	Lockdowns aren't killing the economy, having no handle on the disease is
Apr 23 07:48:43 <twb>	turns out sitting in my living room for the first time in 5 years is not good for my lungs
Apr 23 07:49:14 <wgreenhouse>	twb: dusty in there, is it?
Apr 23 07:49:24 <twb>	I guess
Apr 23 07:49:31 <twb>	I just had to wash my eyes out
Apr 23 07:54:37 <wasamasa>	is that why the map is called dedust
Apr 23 07:58:35 <twb>	wasamasa: hmmmm?
Apr 23 07:59:05 <aidalgol>	twb: Wait, where do you normally play videogames?
Apr 23 08:00:21 <wasamasa>	> Dust (de_dust) is a bomb defusal map, and the predecessor to Dust2. It appears in every game of the multiplayer Counter-Strike series.

Apr 23 08:10:04 <iqubic>	wgreenhouse: The link you gave me doesn't really give me any information on hooks in EXWM.
Apr 23 08:10:09 <iqubic>	Can you help me out?
Apr 23 08:10:09 <dale>	I have so many questions.
Apr 23 08:10:20 *	twb tries to remember the ratio for masa-methi flatbread
Apr 23 08:10:20 <codingquark>	twb: I don't know why you're talking of 80s. People still do it for kids. Not for adults though.
Apr 23 08:10:48 <parsnip>	i have so many answers. 1. 2. 3. ...
Apr 23 08:11:59 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: I was wrong in thinking that you still had to have a function fire on a hook when an individual exwm window was detected changing class or title. It grew that variable to give you one place to put preferences like "make this class floating"
Apr 23 08:12:07 *	parsnip leers at channel
Apr 23 08:12:16 <iqubic>	wgreenhouse: What does that mean?
Apr 23 08:12:42 <parsnip>	bbl
Apr 23 08:12:59 <iqubic>	Basically what I want is to tell EXWM to take any windows with a give WM_CLASS x and make it floating
Apr 23 08:15:34 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: see the example, and see C-h v exwm-manage-configurations. I think your case is something like (setq exwm-manage-configurations '(((string-match-p "foo" exwm-class-name) floating t)))
Apr 23 08:15:44 <iqubic>	I'll try that.
Apr 23 08:17:04 <wgreenhouse>	(Also, doing C-h v exwm-class-name for a given exwm window will give you the WM_CLASS)
Apr 23 08:25:54 <iqubic>	So, if I start a program X, and it spawns an external window, shouldn't those two windows have the same WM_CLASS?
Apr 23 08:31:03 <twb>	So I watched a remake of East Lynne last night
Apr 23 08:31:06 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: by convention, yes. WM_CLASS is meant to indicate the "general class of applications to which the client that owns this window belongs." https://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#WM_CLASS
Apr 23 08:31:27 <twb>	The guy literally goes "just so we're clear: you're my slave now, and you must obey me in all things without question"
Apr 23 08:31:33 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: but nothing in X prevents an application from behaving badly
Apr 23 08:32:13 <twb>	WM_CLASS is optional also
Apr 23 08:32:30 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: WM_INSTANCE_NAME is the other thing you could maybe match against 
Apr 23 08:32:44 <iqubic>	can I access that in EXWM?
Apr 23 08:32:45 <twb>	wgreenhouse: yeah I used that to implement spotlight in ratpoison
Apr 23 08:33:14 <twb>	or... no to implement COMMAND + Tab vs. OPTION + Tab
Apr 23 08:33:59 <wgreenhouse>	iqubic: yes, it's called exwm-instance-name as an elisp variable 
Apr 23 08:34:05 <iqubic>	Cool
Apr 23 08:34:37 <iqubic>	Well, now, I want to take all windows with the exwm-instance-name set to "godot_engine" and make them floating.
Apr 23 08:35:10 <twb>	iqubic: yeah that's a fairly normal workflow
Apr 23 08:35:22 <twb>	exwm might even have a built-in var for that
Apr 23 08:35:30 <iqubic>	For what?
Apr 23 08:35:47 <twb>	"make this class floating"
Apr 23 08:36:03 <wgreenhouse>	try (setq exwm-manage-configurations '(((string-match-p "godot_engine" exwm-instance-name) floating t)))
Apr 23 08:37:14 <twb>	if a computer has a 100W PSU, it'll never draw more than 100W right?
Apr 23 08:38:14 <wgreenhouse>	twb: I think that just means some lab rated the psu to not blow up at 100W
Apr 23 08:38:37 <twb>	surely blow down
Apr 23 08:38:48 <twb>	100W is the downstream rating not the upstream rating
Apr 23 08:38:51 <twb>	(right?)
Apr 23 08:38:54 <wgreenhouse>	don't call me shirley
Apr 23 08:39:30 <wgreenhouse>	but yes you're right
Apr 23 08:45:36 <iqubic>	wgreenhouse: I also have all of my X11 windows set to Char mode by default. Is it possible to set those with an instance name of "godot_engine" to line mode?
Apr 23 08:47:40 <iqubic>	Actually, I'd like to modify this: "(setq exwm-manage-configurations '((t char-mode t)))" so that it applies to everything, EXCEPT the "godot_engine" windows
Apr 23 08:53:01 <jamzattack>	iqubic: https://0x0.st/ijmH.bin something like this should work to switch it to line-mode
Apr 23 08:53:49 <jamzattack>	and add it to exwm-mode-hook
Apr 23 08:54:13 <iqubic>	Would something like this also work: http://dpaste.com/2C682VZ
Apr 23 08:54:45 <jamzattack>	try it?
Apr 23 08:55:11 <iqubic>	If the instance name doesn't match "godot_engine" then it will be set to Char. If it does match, then it will be left in the default line mode.
Apr 23 08:55:48 <iqubic>	At least that's the theory.
Apr 23 08:56:56 <jamzattack>	Hmm, exwm seems to try the predicates only until one matches
Apr 23 08:58:07 <jamzattack>	but that works for me
Apr 23 08:58:40 <iqubic>	Weird.
Apr 23 08:58:45 <iqubic>	I'll see if this works.
Apr 23 08:59:23 <iqubic>	Yeah. That works for me.
Apr 23 09:00:29 <iqubic>	Now, how can I remove the modeline from a window using this variable?
Apr 23 09:00:31 *	bpalmer ponders reading something by Andrey Bieley
Apr 23 09:00:51 <bpalmer>	the trouble with reading "classics" is every one is the "defining" story about something or other
Apr 23 09:01:30 <bpalmer>	or is incomparable. e.g., "In this incomparable novel of the seething revolutionary Russia of 1905" ... come on, I'm sure you can compare it to something.
Apr 23 09:02:02 <iqubic>	So, I know it's possible for EXWM to hide the modeline of a floating window, I just don't know how to do it.
Apr 23 09:08:09 <twb>	bpalmer: there's a joke like that about H.P. Lovecraft
Apr 23 09:08:26 <twb>	like 'it was a crawling mass of writing blah blah... it was indescribable"
Apr 23 09:08:42 <twb>	and the manic pixie is like "never mind, you had a good try"
Apr 23 09:10:46 <jamzattack>	https://0x0.st/ijmN.bin iqubic: here you go
Apr 23 09:11:27 <iqubic>	How do I view that file?
Apr 23 09:11:58 <jamzattack>	It's just plain text, open with eww
Apr 23 09:11:59 <iqubic>	firefox wants me to download it, and then I'm being told that it's a bin file, and not a text file?
Apr 23 09:12:29 <jamzattack>	https://0x0.st/ijmq.el
Apr 23 09:14:34 <iqubic>	that doesn't actually remove the modeline for me.
Apr 23 09:15:39 <jamzattack>	Huh, works with xterm for me
Apr 23 09:16:14 <iqubic>	yeah, that's not working for me.
Apr 23 09:19:42 <jamzattack>	Just installed godot to test, and it works... weird since exwm-manage-configuration hasn't changed since september 2019
Apr 23 09:20:11 <jamzattack>	so it shouldn't be because you're using an old version
Apr 23 09:23:14 <iqubic>	I'm literally using the latest version, pulled from github and compiled on my machine. I'm using the exact opposite thing.
Apr 23 09:24:01 <jamzattack>	yeah me too
Apr 23 09:24:25 <jamzattack>	maybe try using customize-set-variable instead of setq?
Apr 23 09:24:37 <iqubic>	actually, that works for me.
Apr 23 09:24:55 <iqubic>	I added the code to my .emacs, and then just procceed to not execute it.
Apr 23 09:25:18 <iqubic>	I just went ahead and hit C-x C-e and now it's working
Apr 23 09:27:30 <jamzattack>	I actually never used floating windows in exwm before...  it's actually pretty decent
Apr 23 09:57:20 <Twist>	Is there a list of valid orgmode block types around anywhere? I'm not finding it in the manual. I see source blocks and a few paragraph types. (quote, verse, center) Are there others?
Apr 23 10:00:25 <deerpig>	AFAIK it's same as the list in the menu when you use C-, to insert a block.
Apr 23 10:01:08 <deerpig>	notes, center, comment, exprt, quote, src, verse or define your own.

Apr 23 10:16:45 <jamzattack>	C-c C-, runs the command org-insert-structure-template
Apr 23 10:17:57 <Twist>	jamzattack: thanks.
Apr 23 10:18:23 <deerpig>	I stand corrected -- you are correct.  Never chat when you are heavily medicated.
Apr 23 10:18:50 <Twist>	deerpig: Hey, you were right. Just unclear. :D
Apr 23 10:19:31 <Twist>	That directed me to the relevant manual section. Much appreciated. 
Apr 23 10:27:45 <Twist>	Huh. C-c C-, is undefined in my config. Wonder why it's not the default.
Apr 23 10:28:31 <jamzattack>	Oh, it's as of version 27 I think... older versions use abbrevs instead of a menu thing
Apr 23 10:29:09 <jamzattack>	i.e. type "< s TAB" and it expands to "#+BEGIN_SRC ..."
Apr 23 10:29:12 <Twist>	The command works.. it's just not bound
Apr 23 10:29:20 <jamzattack>	oh right
Apr 23 10:29:41 <Twist>	And since it's in the manual as you describe, I was expecting it to be the default.
Apr 23 10:30:41 <jamzattack>	well it's the default for 27+.  Kind of weird that it's bound to a key that can't be used in a terminal though
Apr 23 10:33:09 <Twist>	27's not stable yet, right?
Apr 23 10:33:55 <Twist>	Apologies for idiocy.. I'm trying to pick up emacs and orgmode at the same time.
Apr 23 10:34:00 <jamzattack>	not "officially" yet
Apr 23 10:34:27 <Twist>	A day will come when I'll understand where one ends and the other begins. But it is not this day.
Apr 23 10:44:50 <codingquark>	After installing a package from Debian repo (I installed yaml-mode), how do I load it?
Apr 23 10:45:30 <twb>	codingquark: restart emacs is easiest
Apr 23 10:45:33 <jamzattack>	It would have been installed in /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp so either restart or manually add it to load-path
Apr 23 10:45:39 <twb>	codingquark: otherwise you ^ that
Apr 23 10:46:11 <codingquark>	twb, jamzattack: I killed the YAML buffer and opened the file again. This caused the YAML mode to be activated.
Apr 23 10:46:14 <codingquark>	Quite amazing
Apr 23 10:52:45 <twb>	Hrmmm
Apr 23 10:52:58 <twb>	Let's write a dystopia where pizza is illegal and you are an undercover pizza dealer
Apr 23 10:53:34 <deerpig>	Sounds like something Philip K Dick would write.
Apr 23 10:58:57 <twb>	Hrm, a video game where player 1 is Dennis the Menace, and player 2 tries to stop him
Apr 23 11:06:07 <codingquark>	Why am I doing devops, might I wonder myself
Apr 23 11:06:32 <codingquark>	Let me fetch some caffeine for support
Apr 23 11:08:25 *	twb pictures caffeine trying to give emotional support
Apr 23 11:13:27 <codingquark>	Is there enough research supporting that it does not give emotional support?
Apr 23 11:14:03 <codingquark>	So, do you want to know the CI/CD workflow I have come up with? It involves Kubernetes and Gitlab Review Apps! Yea? Yea?
Apr 23 11:28:22 <codingquark>	Nobody? Alright.
Apr 23 11:28:48 <jamzattack>	I'd love to hear haha
Apr 23 11:28:54 <codingquark>	Oh cool!
Apr 23 11:28:57 <codingquark>	Here it goes
Apr 23 11:28:58 <jamzattack>	can't imagine anything more thrilling
Apr 23 11:29:29 <bremner>	bungee jumping from my desk??
Apr 23 11:29:30 <fsbot>	mu!
Apr 23 11:29:42 <fledermaus>	bungee climbing the empire state building.
Apr 23 11:29:55 <codingquark>	First, every time code is pushed, Gitlab will run tests. These tests will be run under a clean node-alpine docker image.
Apr 23 11:29:59 <flypaper-ultimat>	i wonder how many people now that you can actually add hooks to git that run on commit, and that rejects that commit if those hooks dont exit succesfully
Apr 23 11:30:49 <jamzattack>	just figured that out earlier today actually FACE PALM EMOJI
Apr 23 11:31:02 <bremner>	:thumbsup:
Apr 23 11:31:08 <codingquark>	Then, if the tests succeed, it builds the entire app along with other services like Database, API server etc as Docker images and asks Kubernetes to deploy a new cluster.
Apr 23 11:31:48 <codingquark>	All this is orchestrated by gitlab-ci
Apr 23 11:32:24 <codingquark>	When the cluster is ready, people get a link in gitlab UI from where they can test the app. After validating, they can click a button and the entire cluster vanishes in thin air
Apr 23 11:32:56 <codingquark>	There are rules that make sure such clusters are not deployed for master, production, staging branches.
Apr 23 11:33:08 <codingquark>	For those, deployment is done differently.
Apr 23 11:33:12 <codingquark>	How do you like this?
Apr 23 11:33:58 <codingquark>	For all such runs, gitlab also spins up a spot instance on AWS
Apr 23 11:46:48 <twb>	is there an emoji yet for BOOT STAMPING ON HUMAN FACE FOREVER
Apr 23 11:47:21 <codingquark>	That's a bit too aggressive for a small wall of text, I must say!
Apr 23 11:49:00 <thblt>	codingquark: you wrote “click a button” on #emacs, what do you expect?
Apr 23 11:49:29 <codingquark>	thblt: but... but... It is user friendly!!1!

Apr 23 12:12:34 <twb>	60% packet loss at every hop, SSH still works, but HTML over SSH is timing out
Apr 23 12:13:03 <kensanata>	twb: Are you in a warzone?
Apr 23 12:14:04 <kensanata>	codingquark: Such solutions make me think about CO₂
Apr 23 12:14:47 <twb>	kensanata: well I exaggerated.  http://ix.io/2jbw
Apr 23 12:14:48 <codingquark>	kensanata: good use of unicode
Apr 23 12:15:10 <twb>	But BMC is definitely timing out, and it's not local packet storms 
Apr 23 12:15:36 <kensanata>	codingquark: caps lock as compose key is the best caps lock
Apr 23 12:15:55 <twb>	kensanata: I use it as control because I don't live in .ch
Apr 23 12:16:11 <twb>	so I don't need accents enough to warrant a compose
Apr 23 12:16:36 <twb>	(and when I need cyrillic or korean I switch IM entirely)
Apr 23 12:16:51 <bremner>	to line??
Apr 23 12:16:51 <fsbot>	No!
Apr 23 12:17:43 <kensanata>	I use a lot of arrows, superscripts, subscripts, multiplication sign, real quotes, interrobang, extra brackets... lots of stuff that doesn't require accents and diaerese (because if that were the case I could simply use the Swiss German keyboard layout...)
Apr 23 12:18:28 <kensanata>	And C-x 8 RET is slow as soon as you use stuff regularly.
Apr 23 12:18:32 <bremner>	as opposed to imaginary quotes? such complex typography you have
Apr 23 12:18:36 <bremner>	TeX IM is best IM
Apr 23 12:18:49 <aidalgol>	bremner: Instant Messaging?
Apr 23 12:19:06 <kensanata>	are ' and " even quotes‽
Apr 23 12:19:09 <bremner>	aidalgol: I already made that joke a few minutes ago. Try to keep up.
Apr 23 12:19:36 <codingquark>	No!
Apr 23 12:19:39 <kensanata>	Are we reserving jokes, now?
Apr 23 12:19:46 <bremner>	of course my joke conflated korea and japan. So fair to ignore it
Apr 23 12:21:09 <aidalgol>	You did?
Apr 23 12:21:19 <codingquark>	who is "korea and japan"?
Apr 23 12:23:20 <bremner>	aidalgol: line is an proprietary messaging app popular in japan
Apr 23 12:24:22 <bpalmer>	"Line began in 2011 as the brainchild of engineers at NHN Japan, the Japanese arm of Naver Corporation (formerly NHN) based in South Korea."
Apr 23 12:24:43 <bpalmer>	so it works for both Korea and Japan
Apr 23 12:24:55 <bremner>	oh. damn. You know what, I knew line was popular in Korea too, I just forgot.
Apr 23 12:25:08 <aidalgol>	bremner: Yeah, that was pretty convoluted and obscure.
Apr 23 12:25:19 <bremner>	aidalgol: ack
Apr 23 12:25:28 <aidalgol>	Although I think it pitches itself as a "social networking app".
Apr 23 12:25:35 <bremner>	like emacs
Apr 23 12:25:42 <bremner>	or like nc
Apr 23 12:25:47 <bpalmer>	I thought that was a social distancing app
Apr 23 12:25:53 <codingquark>	I want to know if vim supports colored emoji properly
Apr 23 12:26:06 <jamzattack>	depends on the terminal I guess
Apr 23 12:26:49 <aidalgol>	bpalmer: That's Tinder.
Apr 23 12:27:07 <twb>	in my day we didn't have "social distancing apps", they were just called yardsticks
Apr 23 12:27:08 <aidalgol>	Go on Tinder; find no one; feel socially distant from everyone; silently weep.
Apr 23 12:27:48 <aidalgol>	I thought "yardstick" was only a term in backwards countries that still use imperial.
Apr 23 12:27:50 <twb>	aidalgol: I think you're supposed to run it when you live in manhattan, not on a farm
Apr 23 12:28:12 <twb>	aidalgol: I had to say "yardstick" because the joke wouldn't work in regular language
Apr 23 12:28:21 <twb>	I suppose I could have said "the cane"
Apr 23 12:29:22 <aidalgol>	twb: No, it's really not just me.
Apr 23 12:29:37 <bpalmer>	Ruby on Rails; Go on Tinder; Java on Bumble. I just can't keep up.

Apr 23 12:30:20 <codingquark>	At least dunst is showing emojis well
Apr 23 12:30:54 <twb>	aidalgol: that's Wings on the River Kwai
Apr 23 12:31:37 <aidalgol>	*sigh*...
Apr 23 12:32:17 <codingquark>	ho ho ho
Apr 23 12:32:20 <aidalgol>	twb: Look, the joke was that Ruby is a girl's name, and "damsel in distress tied to railroad tracks" was an trope of silent films.
Apr 23 12:33:54 <bpalmer>	I never heard it
Apr 23 12:34:21 <aidalgol>	bpalmer: You never do hear it coming.
Apr 23 12:34:36 <aidalgol>	Snidely Whiplash uses only silent, stealth trains.

Apr 23 12:42:10 <aidalgol>	rudybot: This is just sounding creepy now, isn't it?
Apr 23 12:42:29 <rudybot>	aidalgol: because you are sounding kinda creepy right now and validating the whole point of using codenames

Apr 23 12:47:02 <Twist>	hodapp: is ##math here on freenode worth the time?
Apr 23 12:47:09 <bpalmer>	rudybot: all this linear algebra stuff is really easy as long as it all fits on a line.
Apr 23 12:47:18 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Usually those programmers only glue stuff together, so all they need is boolean algebra and given the lack of quality in today's machines, voodoo. 
Apr 23 12:47:24 <hodapp>	Twist: who knows. there are enough math people here that I usually get an answer
Apr 23 12:48:36 <hodapp>	I have my same series of matrices from the other day that looks like M0 = N1 * N2 * N3..., M1 = N1 * P1 * N2 * P2 * N3..., M2 = N1 * P1^2 * N2 * P2^2 * N3..., Mi = N1 * P1^i * N2 * P2^2 * N3

Apr 23 12:50:09 <hodapp>	and it looks like there "should" be a way to analytically solve for X based on the formula for Mi but I don't know what sorts of transforms to do
Apr 23 12:50:15 <Plazma>	bpalmer: as one who uses linear algebra in quantum computing research, it gets complicated :P
Apr 23 12:50:47 <hodapp>	transforms are all 4x4 homogeneous & affine transforms for 3D geometry
Apr 23 12:52:20 <bpalmer>	Plazma: aye, I was making a weak joke about linearity and algebra
Apr 23 12:54:09 <Plazma>	bpalmer: ohhhh , i get it now :p
Apr 23 12:57:02 <bremner>	bpalmer: I thought you were advocating for programming in APL
Apr 23 12:57:35 <bpalmer>	I'm not *not* advocating that...
Apr 23 12:57:51 <hodapp>	it sounds like you are
Apr 23 12:58:25 <kensanata>	I recently looked at J. It even has an Emacs Mode.
Apr 23 12:58:30 <Plazma>	bpalmer: i suck at all math including linear algebra, seems like it's a game you never 'win' but do a bit better each time

Apr 23 13:06:02 <hodapp>	hummm. if I can turn Mi = N0*(P0^i)*N1*(P1^i) to Mi=M0 * X^i through some hypothetical transform then I can just repeat this process recursively and turn an arbitrary string of products to what I need

Apr 23 13:16:02 <hodapp>	kensanata: but all I wanted was to know the magical linear algebra thingy I'm not doing right here :[
Apr 23 13:16:08 <hodapp>	not to start another VCS war
Apr 23 13:16:31 <kensanata>	the VCS war would be just a distraction, to be honest.
Apr 23 13:18:48 <bremner>	oh look, it's boris johnson with COVID19
Apr 23 13:19:08 <bremner>	I see your VCS war and raise you brexit
Apr 23 13:21:43 <twb>	What's the equivalent of NAPLAN for mobile phone numbers
Apr 23 13:25:07 <fledermaus>	twb: don't think there is one - it's down to each country.
Apr 23 13:25:37 <fledermaus>	eg in the US mobile phones don't have a separate allocation, they're issued out of the region where you first register your phone.
Apr 23 13:25:54 <fledermaus>	in the UK they have their own prefix blocks.
Apr 23 13:26:11 <twb>	they = telcos, or counties?
Apr 23 13:26:17 <fledermaus>	countries.
Apr 23 13:26:26 <twb>	I meant counties, like Sussex or whatever
Apr 23 13:26:55 <hodapp>	loooool, our one friend came from Ireland, got a mobile phone in the US, and he just asked where he can go to opt out of all these damn robocalls and telemarketers he keeps getting.
Apr 23 13:26:57 <fledermaus>	oh. well in the US say you're in the 555-* area, and you buy a mobile phone- you get a 555-* mobile number
Apr 23 13:27:26 <fledermaus>	so eg a NYC resident will have a mobile with a NYC code.
Apr 23 13:27:26 <twb>	so if I learn your mobile number, I can make a good guess it was (say) initially issued in Ecuador but not which telco or state/provide/terroritory
Apr 23 13:27:35 <twb>	fledermaus: oh weird
Apr 23 13:27:46 <twb>	fledermaus: here landlines and mobiles have totally different prefixes
Apr 23 13:27:54 <fledermaus>	twb: well a mobile number includes the +X country code, so you can definitely do country.
Apr 23 13:28:09 <bremner>	twb: same in countries where caller pays to call mobile numbers
Apr 23 13:28:10 <fledermaus>	twb: I think most countries separate out the mobile prefixes. prefices?
Apr 23 13:28:35 <fledermaus>	but the US (or possibly all NANPA countries) are different.
Apr 23 13:28:41 <bpalmer>	basically, in the US, people's mobile phone numbers are a great way to leak data about where you lived when you were 12-18 (or whenever you get your first phone)
Apr 23 13:28:56 <bpalmer>	since once the number is issued, people can keep transferring it across the country.
Apr 23 13:29:10 <fledermaus>	so for most countries the mobile phone # tells you at most which country.
Apr 23 13:29:18 <ilkermutlu>	fledermaus: i think "prefixes"
Apr 23 13:29:27 <fledermaus>	in the US it tells you the original issuing local prefix
Apr 23 13:29:36 <fledermaus>	ilkermutlu: I was joking :) I know.
Apr 23 13:29:38 <hodapp>	the hackerspace in Cincinnati, Hive13, is named after Cinci's area code, 513
Apr 23 13:29:55 <hodapp>	which was also Dayton's area code till the early '90s or something when Dayton got 937
Apr 23 13:32:03 <fledermaus>	in the UK the number can also hint at which mobile network a number is on (since I think it comes out of the telco's allocation) but since number porting was enforced that's probably not helpful unless you're hacking the phone system
Apr 23 13:33:08 <hodapp>	hacking the phone system is the #3 hobby of the youth of America, behind having the sex (which is #1), and smoking drugs (which is #2).
Apr 23 13:33:26 <hodapp>	I think Satanic cults are #4?
Apr 23 13:33:53 *	fledermaus prefers to smoke bacon. or salmon.
Apr 23 13:34:09 <hodapp>	ooh, I've never smoked my own bacon or salmon, but I do make gravlax pretty often
Apr 23 13:34:23 <fledermaus>	great, now I'm hungry.
Apr 23 13:34:36 <hodapp>	I need to make another batch of sauerkraut
Apr 23 13:34:43 <hodapp>	also sourdough
Apr 23 13:35:20 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: Just did this; great use of a good piece of salmon and a few days' patience
Apr 23 13:35:30 <hodapp>	wgreenhouse: what sort of seasonings did you use?
Apr 23 13:36:50 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: this time, pretty simple--coriander seed, caraway seed, black pepper, salt and sugar. And vodka of course. No dill because one must suffer a little in quarantine 
Apr 23 13:37:03 <hodapp>	vodka?
Apr 23 13:37:20 <hodapp>	I normally just do dill, and coriander or caraway (lots of sugar and salt of course)
Apr 23 13:37:26 <bremner>	thank goodness quarantine means 40 days. We must be almost there.
Apr 23 13:37:52 <wgreenhouse>	Just like a shot or so. Soaks into the salmon and maybe helps the spices infuse or maybe that's just woo but I do it
Apr 23 13:38:15 <hodapp>	huh
Apr 23 13:38:27 <bpalmer>	Ah, sourdough.  https://twitter.com/GretchenKoch/status/1248351210475831297
Apr 23 13:38:29 <hodapp>	I'm not doing anything else with this Svedka...
Apr 23 13:39:55 <wgreenhouse>	Just sort of brush it over top with the spices
Apr 23 13:40:11 <fledermaus>	hm. have you used anything other than vodka? like say rum or gin?
Apr 23 13:40:28 <wgreenhouse>	Gin would probably be great
Apr 23 13:40:32 <wgreenhouse>	Good idea
Apr 23 13:40:37 <fledermaus>	well gin is basically vodka + botanicals
Apr 23 13:40:53 <fledermaus>	so arguably you already have tried it :)
Apr 23 13:41:07 <wgreenhouse>	Right but not usually juniper
Apr 23 13:41:19 <wgreenhouse>	Which is one of the main gin botanicals
Apr 23 13:41:27 <hodapp>	have done juniper in my sauerkraut but not in my gravlax
Apr 23 13:42:02 <twb>	i prefer cisco
Apr 23 13:42:04 <bremner>	rudybot: ok, what about instant gratification from bad fish?
Apr 23 13:42:08 <rudybot>	bremner: we're living in a world of instant gratification and severely shortened attention spans :D
Apr 23 13:42:24 <bremner>	2 rite bro
Apr 23 13:43:27 <hodapp>	rudybot: it's such a shame how nowadays all of our explanations pretend like the world used to be dramatically better
Apr 23 13:43:56 <rudybot>	hodapp: the number of citizens per representative has increased dramatically since the original vision laid out in the constitution, though to hit anywhere close to the limit  put forth in the constitution we would have a house that was so large as to be almost useless.
Apr 23 13:47:01 <bpalmer>	rudybot: remember how awesome the world was in November?
Apr 23 13:47:05 <rudybot>	bpalmer: ... they did as of November anyway
Apr 23 13:53:18 <twb>	hodapp: I'm not sure if you're being snarky about "make america great again" or "we have always been at war with indochina"
Apr 23 13:53:20 <kensanata>	On emacs-devel, RMS says that he only wants to recommend #emacs on gnu.org if it has "a general policy of not promoting nonfree programs (neither applications nor systems) nor helping people use them." My impression is that we have no such policy and that the ops are pretty meh about one. Got strong opinions? https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-04/msg00740.html
Apr 23 13:54:11 <twb>	kensanata: channel policy or regulars' personal policies?
Apr 23 13:54:45 <hodapp>	twb: it's a joke about how people just always make up nostalgic bullshit explanations that blatantly ignore facts
Apr 23 13:54:46 <kensanata>	twb: "check that each of those three sites has a general policy" sounds like a channel policy.
Apr 23 13:55:06 <twb>	I *mostly* recommend DFSG solutions, but not always, and I'll be cranky if #emacs tries to stop me mentioning non-DFSG options
Apr 23 13:55:08 <kensanata>	Also note "Helping people use Emacs on a nonfree system or with some well known nonfree program is ok as an exception."
Apr 23 13:55:28 <kensanata>	twb: Then again, when are you not cranky?
Apr 23 13:55:31 <hodapp>	twb: like people who lament how "it's so dangerous and violent out there nowadays" and ignore that violent crime has been falling for decades
Apr 23 13:55:57 <twb>	hodapp: one snark I liked a while ago was americans going like "why haven't we had any quality of life improvements since 1900"
Apr 23 13:56:06 <kensanata>	Wow
Apr 23 13:56:21 <twb>	hodapp: and somebody saying "because all the improvements went to people who still had like 60% infant mortality"
Apr 23 13:56:29 <hodapp>	haaaah
Apr 23 13:56:43 <twb>	and no running water and no artificial lighting and not even a hole to shit in
Apr 23 13:57:17 <twb>	literally, half the people alive today don't have a hole to shit in
Apr 23 14:03:14 <miskatonic>	they should shit into the security holes of Windows 10
Apr 23 14:03:22 <hodapp>	no
Apr 23 14:03:34 <skangas>	kensanata: Thanks for bringing this question here.  For what it's worth, I personally would support a decision to adopt such a policy.  I'm not a regular though, as you know.
Apr 23 14:06:28 <bpalmer>	I've spoken up against it; I think it's fine for individuals to choose whether to promote or help people (in the same way that many people in the channel don't particularly promote or help with spacemacs/aquamacs/etc, although that may be for different reasons)
Apr 23 14:09:06 <skangas>	I have to admit I'm not sure what it would mean in practice.  Perhaps it would mostly amount to pointing out to users recommending the use of proprietary software <foo> that the channel has a policy not to recommend it.
Apr 23 14:09:25 <twb>	kensanata: btw you could use ircs:// instead of irc:// ;-)
Apr 23 14:10:33 <rpav>	"you must be this dogmatic to ride the ride"
Apr 23 14:10:50 <thblt>	Not recommending is not the same as “not helping”.  Not helping kinda sucks.
Apr 23 14:11:49 <fledermaus>	It's not as if this channel is a hotbed of proprietary software evangelism.
Apr 23 14:11:55 <rpav>	having a "policy of not recommending" and "reminding people to not recommend" is a bit creepy cultist vibe
Apr 23 14:12:10 <rpav>	well exactly
Apr 23 14:12:48 <skangas>	To be fair, there are many places where one can get help with proprietary software already.
Apr 23 14:12:54 <fledermaus>	We barely have any policies beyond "could you be less of a dick, 'mkay?" and "we try to answer emacs questions first when we're not debating Kant or how to smoke salmon."
Apr 23 14:13:15 <wasamasa>	but what if your recipes aren't free
Apr 23 14:13:18 <fledermaus>	or indeed how kant would smoke salmon.
Apr 23 14:13:28 <rpav>	if it was "the channel _has a policy of recommending_ non-free software and often promotes non-free solutions, non-free rewrites of emacs, etc, that's a bit against our philosophy" and "are you dogmatic enough"
Apr 23 14:13:34 <rpav>	err rather than "are you .."
Apr 23 14:17:03 <thblt>	Microsoft Visual Emacs for 
Apr 23 14:17:07 <thblt>	Windows
Apr 23 14:17:34 <bremner>	speaking of visual, how are electron apps for blind people?
Apr 23 14:17:47 <bremner>	do they work ok with screenreaders?
Apr 23 14:18:37 <bpalmer>	https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/accessibility : "Electron applications keep accessibility disabled by default for performance reasons but there are multiple ways to enable it."
Apr 23 14:19:06 <bpalmer>	it looks like there are solutions for windows and macos
Apr 23 14:19:43 <bpalmer>	no mention of *nix accessibility, which probably means support is terrible.
Apr 23 14:20:56 <thblt>	This may be a Chromium thing “For performance reasons Chromium waits until it detects the presence of assistive technology before enabling full support for accessibility APIs.”
Apr 23 14:21:32 <bpalmer>	https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11544 makes a claim dated march 20 that "Chromium now has support for Orca, which is available to Electron developers and users via the --force-renderer-accessibility flag."
Apr 23 14:21:55 <bpalmer>	(orca being a screenreader for linux and solaris)
Apr 23 14:23:58 <fledermaus>	wait wait wait
Apr 23 14:24:09 <fledermaus>	electron does things _for_ performance?
Apr 23 14:24:25 <fledermaus>	like, this is the result after they _tried_?
Apr 23 14:25:45 <bpalmer>	vscode seems pretty code when I've tried it.
Apr 23 14:25:51 <bpalmer>	pretty fast, that is.
Apr 23 14:26:08 <kensanata>	Regarding an #emacs policy I think the best course of action would simply be admitting that we wouldn't know how to enforce such a policy and that therefore not getting listed on gnu.org is OK.
Apr 23 14:26:23 <fledermaus>	+1
Apr 23 14:26:25 <kensanata>	I just care about people being nice to each other and people answering emacs questions before other questions.
Apr 23 14:26:51 <rpav>	benevolent anarchism! ;)
Apr 23 14:26:54 <fledermaus>	noch einmal plus-eins.
Apr 23 14:27:31 <kensanata>	rpav: I don't know enough about anarchism to comment. :)
Apr 23 14:31:31 <grym>	rpav: i know of a nice house of hospitality in maryland.. 
Apr 23 14:33:30 <bremner>	I know a house in New Orleans, they call the rising sun...
Apr 23 14:33:41 <rpav>	kensanata: same, i just like that one song ;)
Apr 23 14:33:47 <grym>	oh there's one in pgh too that's still alive 
Apr 23 14:38:04 <miskatonic>	so electron must be boycotted rigorously at any cost whatsoever
Apr 23 14:39:51 <grym>	miskatonic: alas, signal-desktop is super handy 
Apr 23 14:41:10 <bpalmer>	hopefully PWAs will replace a lot of the electron apps
Apr 23 14:42:11 <bremner>	Personal Weapon Arrays??
Apr 23 14:42:12 <fsbot>	Improbable!
Apr 23 14:42:21 <mplsCorwin>	kensanata: I agree with the consensus; it's hard to have 'policies' on an help forum and I think making this a chil place to chat and get help is of more value than the pat on the head from RMS and gnu.org.
Apr 23 14:43:07 <mplsCorwin>	And I say this as a total FSF fanboy.
Apr 23 14:44:46 <mplsCorwin>	It's better this channel be super fun and useful to those here than that it be a primary organ for supporting Emacs.  The home page, Savannah, plus Devel and the other lists have that covered anyway.
Apr 23 14:45:28 <mplsCorwin>	also, what rpav said RE creepy.
Apr 23 14:48:46 <grym>	"you must be our kind of free in order to be free" is ... let's go with "highly debatable"

Apr 23 15:20:47 <wgreenhouse>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)#Multiple-word_identifiers says there's no fully agreed-upon name for lisp-case
Apr 23 15:20:51 <wgreenhouse>	kebab-case is a fun candidate
Apr 23 15:22:08 <wgreenhouse>	Aurora_v_kosmose: that would enable some of the blocking bugs against a chromium-based torbrowser to be cleared

Apr 23 15:26:16 <mfg>	Hi :) I have a question regarding diminish and helm/geiser. I have (with-eval-after-load 'helm '(diminish 'helm-mode)) in my init file. It works. But when i start geiser with M-x run-geiser the indicator pops up again. Does anybody know why? or how i can find out?
Apr 23 15:30:05 <bpalmer>	mfg: with-eval-after-load, unlike eval-after-load, does not require quoting the form.
Apr 23 15:30:14 <bpalmer>	mfg: it's like progn.
Apr 23 15:30:20 <mfg>	oh, okay
Apr 23 15:30:41 <bpalmer>	so, (with-eval-after-load "helm" (diminish 'helm-mode))  , probably
Apr 23 15:31:11 <mfg>	i will try that
Apr 23 15:33:18 <mfg>	this doesn't solve the problem. After starting geiser it pops up again and i have to evaluate with-eval-after-load a second time
Apr 23 15:33:31 <bpalmer>	mfg: the second time it does work?
Apr 23 15:33:45 <mfg>	the second time removes it again, yes
Apr 23 15:36:38 <bpalmer>	Hmm. try "helm-mode" instead of "helm" as the first argument.
Apr 23 15:37:02 <bpalmer>	helm.el defines a minor mode helm--minor-mode , but avoids loading helm-mode.el which defines helm-mode
Apr 23 15:38:15 <mfg>	that solved it, thanks :)
Apr 23 15:38:54 <bpalmer>	awesome.
Apr 23 15:43:03 <bpalmer>	and with that, time to go be productive in the cyberdeck.
Apr 23 15:46:20 <bpalmer>	(hmm, technomancy built a cyberdeck once. That looks interesting)

Apr 23 18:21:42 <bremner>	apparently only a subset of features are accesible
Apr 23 18:21:59 <wgreenhouse>	I learned lately that the fsf has actually been running discourse for a while
Apr 23 18:22:04 <wgreenhouse>	as one of the fsf associate member toys
Apr 23 18:22:05 <bremner>	don't ask me the details; I can barely be bothered to read mailing lists. If it gets any harder I'll just stop
Apr 23 18:22:41 <CaffeineVaccine>	is there a way to exit `minibuffer-inactive-mode` in elisp?
Apr 23 18:23:19 <ober>	elisp is the atoms that make up everything you see, touch, and interact with... so yes.
Apr 23 18:23:57 <CaffeineVaccine>	at the end of the function I'm creating, I'm stuck in the minibuffer with `minibuffer-inactive-mode`, with  no way to get out of it other than to `(other-window 1)` it.
Apr 23 18:24:20 <CaffeineVaccine>	but that's not something I want to do. And I can't `(keyboard-quit)` because then I exit the function..
Apr 23 18:24:26 <CaffeineVaccine>	So it's like a catch-22 situation
Apr 23 18:25:35 <wasamasa>	I'm mildly curious what gotchas I'll uncover by moving my melpa stuff off github
Apr 23 18:25:47 <wasamasa>	theoretically there should be no issues whatsoever
Apr 23 18:26:00 <wgreenhouse>	what gotchas do you expect?
Apr 23 18:26:16 <wasamasa>	things like melpa-stable not picking up my releases
Apr 23 18:26:38 <wasamasa>	aside from melpa I do scheme stuff and that one particular community expects release tarballs
Apr 23 18:26:45 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: surely melpa's coding is general to git and not specific to git_hub_
Apr 23 18:26:47 <wasamasa>	so I've hacked up code to generate them
Apr 23 18:26:49 <CaffeineVaccine>	Actually `(keyboard-quit)`/`(exit-minibuffer)`/etc. won't even exit the minibuffer when in `minibuffer-inactive-mode`. 
Apr 23 18:27:09 <wasamasa>	they do have separate git and github fetchers, something is bound to be different between them
Apr 23 18:28:14 <wasamasa>	like the github fetcher getting more github-specific info
Apr 23 18:29:08 <wgreenhouse>	melpa-stable "releases" are just git tags, yeah?
Apr 23 18:29:33 <wasamasa>	that's my impression of it
Apr 23 18:30:01 <wasamasa>	I remember one hitch where they accidentally deleted all their data and didn't repopulate the stable packages
Apr 23 18:30:19 <wasamasa>	packages reappeared there only after pushing a new tag
Apr 23 18:30:27 <wasamasa>	so for a while you couldn't install evil from melpa-stable :D
Apr 23 18:31:08 <CaffeineVaccine>	anyone have any ideas?
Apr 23 18:32:43 <wgreenhouse>	CaffeineVaccine: without seeing your library, it kind of sounds like whatever you're trying to do is probably too low-level. if you're using the minibuffer to get user input, something like `read-minibuffer' should get you outta there when it's done
Apr 23 18:33:20 <wgreenhouse>	CaffeineVaccine: alternatively, I think a save-window-excursion would get you back home once the user is done interacting with the minibuffer
Apr 23 18:39:10 <CaffeineVaccine>	wgreenhouse: very interesting ideas
Apr 23 18:39:12 <CaffeineVaccine>	wgreenhouse: thanks
Apr 23 18:39:51 <wgreenhouse>	CaffeineVaccine: you're welcome; I think that is the order I would try them in, too, as save-window-excursion is imperfect and sometimes surprising
Apr 23 18:40:01 <wgreenhouse>	might revert the emacs window config to a state the user finds unexpected
Apr 23 18:40:45 <bpalmer>	Repeating a question in case others are active with more opinions: 'On emacs-devel, RMS says that he only wants to recommend #emacs on gnu.org if it has "a general policy of not promoting nonfree programs (neither applications nor systems) nor helping people use them." My impression is that we have no such policy and that the ops are pretty meh about one. Got strong opinions?
Apr 23 18:40:45 <bpalmer>	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-04/msg00740.html '
Apr 23 18:41:49 <wasamasa>	it seems like a slippery slope
Apr 23 18:43:33 <bpalmer>	some people are always trying to ice skate uphill.
Apr 23 18:44:29 <cvandusen>	Is there any faster way to go??
Apr 23 18:44:30 <fsbot>	Cannot predict now
Apr 23 18:46:26 <technomancy>	lol; this channel is a "site"?
Apr 23 18:47:33 <bpalmer>	a site for sore ice
Apr 23 18:47:33 <bandali>	he probably saw a link and thought so
Apr 23 18:47:45 <bandali>	maybe didn't notice that it's an irc:// one
Apr 23 18:48:24 <wgreenhouse>	in fairness we were listed among things that actually are websites
Apr 23 18:48:28 <cvandusen>	He's probably concerned that #emacs runs non-free javascript 
Apr 23 18:49:06 <bandali>	and #emacs is already listed on https://www.gnu.org/server/irc-rules.html, so i'm hoping we can be thoughtful and not promote nonfree software/systems here
Apr 23 18:49:31 <wasamasa>	just define promoting nonfree stuff as being an asshat, bam
Apr 23 18:49:33 <wasamasa>	problem solved
Apr 23 18:49:57 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: that page also implies that contacting the campaigns manager at FSF will somehow get abuse issues at #emacs resolved, which I think is...optimistic?
Apr 23 18:50:23 <wasamasa>	as optimistic as the RMS take on netiquettes
Apr 23 18:50:59 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: as bpalmer pointed out, this channel predates any official "blessing" by fsf/gnu of #emacs being on freenode, as well as the requirement that single-# channels be officially sanctioned. but otoh we have the current emacs maintainer as founder and op so that may be a nonissue
Apr 23 18:51:32 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, afaik the fsf staff, including the campaigns team, have ops privileges on nearly all fsf/gnu channels, and can intervene if need be. though, i think for gnu-related channels they'd ask gnu people first
Apr 23 18:51:58 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: are there any people on fsf staff (except accidentally) who are ops on /chanserv access #emacs list?
Apr 23 18:52:02 <tromey>	what is being proposed?
Apr 23 18:52:13 <wgreenhouse>	I'm saying I think that page is making a claim that's not necessarily accurate about the status of #emacs
Apr 23 18:52:21 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, i think johnsu01 is one
Apr 23 18:52:44 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: yeah, he is
Apr 23 18:53:00 <wasamasa>	anyway, I see that as a chance to quickly resolve this one
Apr 23 18:53:22 <wasamasa>	if #emacs is considered an official GNU promoting channel, surely it can be recommended
Apr 23 18:53:28 <bpalmer>	tromey: the proposal, I guess, would be that the channel adopts a general policy of etc etc
Apr 23 18:53:32 <wgreenhouse>	I wonder if the participants in that email thread have already looked at that page
Apr 23 18:54:16 <bandali>	and in all fairness, in the reply above rms does say:
Apr 23 18:54:18 <bandali>	Helping people use Emacs on a nonfree system or with some well known
Apr 23 18:54:19 <bandali>	nonfree program is ok as an exception.  (See References in GNU Coding
Apr 23 18:54:19 <bandali>	Standards.)
Apr 23 18:54:47 <bpalmer>	(that particular page about the irc channels also discourages off-topic conversation, so ... hm)
Apr 23 18:55:05 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: right. I told skangas that, de facto, that's generally followed here (the only discussion of nonfree software/systems that really happens is e.g. emacs os-compatibility issues)
Apr 23 18:55:09 <bandali>	but yeah besides that, i think it's distasteful to recommend or help with nonfree programs that are somehow remotely related to emacs
Apr 23 18:55:17 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, right
Apr 23 18:55:27 <ober>	yeah... they had a page about operating systems too, but some how Linus never changed his communications style to conform... 
Apr 23 18:55:35 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: but having that be the de facto vibe of the channel is different than formally enforcing it
Apr 23 18:56:40 <holomorph>	i write elisp to interact with nonfree software, do i get banned now??
Apr 23 18:56:40 <fsbot>	My sources say no!
Apr 23 18:56:47 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, not *that* different i think, practically. it could be as simple as "hey, discussion of nonfree programs is off-topic for #emacs"
Apr 23 18:56:53 <holomorph>	whew
Apr 23 18:57:07 <bandali>	that happens somewhat often e.g. on #guix when people ask how to install nonfree drivers
Apr 23 18:57:29 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: another problem is that that gnu page's rules are different than https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#toc3
Apr 23 18:57:41 <wgreenhouse>	which anticipates and sets parameters around off-topic conduct
Apr 23 18:58:13 <wgreenhouse>	or more specifically https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#toc6
Apr 23 18:58:15 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, right, and i think that's fine? channels can have more specific rules/guidelines so long as they don't fly in the face of gnu's
Apr 23 18:58:36 *	bpalmer doesn't really care about gnu's policies, just for the record
Apr 23 18:58:57 *	bandali does, just for the record
Apr 23 18:59:43 <ober>	,aec
Apr 23 18:59:44 <fsbot>	ober, AEC is an acronym for "Actual Emacs Content". Given how rare that is in #emacs
Apr 23 19:00:14 <bpalmer>	at any rate. I or kensanata or another op will be asking for people's opinions periodically to get a sense of the channel's feelings. Feel free to drop a PM to a friendly op if you'd like to express an opinion privately.
Apr 23 19:00:50 <bandali>	so long as we're kind to each other and don't encourage use of nonfree software we should all be just fine :-)
Apr 23 19:01:03 <bpalmer>	the opinions expressed at this point in time are already more varied than the ones from earlier today, so more points of view are being represented :)
Apr 23 19:02:01 <bpalmer>	Uhm. I don't agree with that stance, either.
Apr 23 19:02:53 <bandali>	what stance?
Apr 23 19:03:28 <goatish>	Hi team, I don't know if this is a good time but I'm trying to add timezones to my timestamps in org mode. I'm inserting these timestamps with C-c C-u . and they appear in format <2020-04-23 Thu 13:44>. Is there any way to add some kind of timezone, such as a UTC offset? I've been digging through the docs and tried setting org-export-date-timestamp-format by adding %z but that didnt seem to help
Apr 23 19:03:39 <holomorph>	i think we'll be just fine largely ignoring emacs-devel
Apr 23 19:03:55 <ober>	^^
Apr 23 19:04:24 <bandali>	that's...
Apr 23 19:04:36 <goatish>	(originally this was for exporting but having them display in emacs too would be great too)
Apr 23 19:04:37 <bpalmer>	goatish: what command is C-c C-u .   ? In my org that just does an upheading
Apr 23 19:05:17 <bpalmer>	well, C-c C-u does that.
Apr 23 19:05:34 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: "flying in the face of" is kind of the question. I think the gnu.org page's attitude toward off-topic content "flies in the face of" the emacswiki rules (which are the only rules most of the ops here were ever aware existed for this channel)
Apr 23 19:05:34 <goatish>	That's a good question! I tried to do the C-h k but wasn't sure how to return the function for multi keys like that
Apr 23 19:05:50 <goatish>	PS: I'm a noob
Apr 23 19:06:06 <bpalmer>	goatish: C-h k and then start the sequence ; when it stops accepting input, you've reached the command :)
Apr 23 19:06:08 <wgreenhouse>	there is a direct conflict, is off-topic content in general allowed (with limitations) or not
Apr 23 19:06:12 <goatish>	I think it's org-time-stamp
Apr 23 19:06:46 <scheming_around>	This is driving me mad: for some reason, pdf-tools doesn't work correctly when scrolling down using the mouse, but it does work correctly when scrolling up
Apr 23 19:06:56 <goatish>	However, if I run org-time-stamp with M-x it doesn't add the time. Wheras C-u C-c . does
Apr 23 19:07:23 <ober>	scheming_around: is it still rendering?
Apr 23 19:07:30 <scheming_around>	When scrolling down, the page just scrolls out of the frame and then pdf-tools redisplays that page from the beginning
Apr 23 19:07:35 <bpalmer>	aha. C-u C-c is different than C-c C-u . C-u is the "universal prefix" -- running it before a command usually changes it in some way
Apr 23 19:07:59 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, regarding being on/off topic, that gnu.org pages says: Keep it on topic — personal attacks, trolling/baiting or flooding (posting multiple repetitive lines or large amounts of code) of the channel will not be tolerated.
Apr 23 19:08:03 <goatish>	I think I made a mistake when I originally said C-c C-u, and had them reversed
Apr 23 19:08:12 <bandali>	which i think is in line with "no asshatery" bit in the #emacs topic
Apr 23 19:08:22 <CaffeineVaccine>	wgreenhouse: Found another way: `(throw 'exit t)`
Apr 23 19:09:01 <bpalmer>	goatish: https://orgmode.org/manual/Custom-time-format.html#Custom-time-format  -- change org-time-stamp-custom-format 
Apr 23 19:09:30 <bpalmer>	goatish: and you need to enable the timestamp overlays
Apr 23 19:09:36 <goatish>	Thanks bpalmer, I'll give it a try
Apr 23 19:10:34 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: do you think, anecdotally, that the % of off-topic (not abuse, just not about emacs) here is roughly in line with other gnu channels, or are we wildly more off topic
Apr 23 19:11:21 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, i don't think we need to keep #emacs *strictly* emacs-related at all times. hell, even #gnu and #fsf sometimes diverge into drastically off-topic discussions sometimes. in those cases, we gently remind people to try and bring discussion back to topic and perhaps take unrelated discussion to more appropriate places
Apr 23 19:11:37 <tromey>	TBH, emacs is normally more off-topic but also perhaps less trolly/irritating than some other chans
Apr 23 19:11:55 <tromey>	anyway I would be opposed to a major policy change, since IME #emacs works well already
Apr 23 19:12:08 <bandali>	i get the impression that perhaps #emacs is a *bit* more off-topic sometimes, but not by too much
Apr 23 19:12:14 <bandali>	and i don't think it's a problem
Apr 23 19:12:21 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	#lisp has a very seriousface on-topic attitude.
Apr 23 19:12:41 <bandali>	almost anytime i look here, there's been or is already some emacs-related discussion going on, which is great and on-topic
Apr 23 19:12:48 <grym>	i understand why the rules are different in both places, but i like off-topic in chat here. In #python where i also hang out a lot, you can't do that.  channel's too big 
Apr 23 19:12:57 <se-sm-ca>	is there an elisp channel or is list the closest thing
Apr 23 19:13:02 <wgreenhouse>	bandali, tromey: then perhaps the answer to the email thread should be to point out that this channel is already an official gnu channel (citing to that page), with policies in line with other gnu channels and both johnsu01 and johnw among the operators
Apr 23 19:14:13 <bandali>	right
Apr 23 19:14:16 <goatish>	bpalmer: I set org-time-stamp-custom-format to "%F %a %R %z" but it didn't add the timezone for the %z part. I confirmed that org-time-stamp-custom-format was set with C-h v. I also toggled org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays a couple of times
Apr 23 19:14:41 <bandali>	wgreenhouse, i haven't been keeping up to date with emacs-devel for a few days, i'll be catching up soon, and might send a reply along those lines
Apr 23 19:14:44 <grym>	(and i really appreciate the crusty old school vibe here) 
Apr 23 19:14:54 <wasamasa>	lol
Apr 23 19:14:56 <hodapp>	get off my lawn.
Apr 23 19:15:02 <wasamasa>	the crusty chat
Apr 23 19:15:05 <ober>	what time is it?
Apr 23 19:15:12 <hodapp>	time for you to get off my lawn too
Apr 23 19:15:16 <bpalmer>	goatish: hmm. I guess I don't know.
Apr 23 19:15:38 <goatish>	Well thanks for your help. I'm learning a lot :)
Apr 23 19:15:42 <lampilelo>	what kind of off-topic are you talking about?
Apr 23 19:15:55 *	ober is not sure there is sufficient evidence that 'commercial software' is stealing free support here.
Apr 23 19:15:58 <grym>	wasamasa: all i'm saying is that i didn't join this channel from 2005 to 2017 and when i rejoined nothing seems to have changed except one guy got banned 
Apr 23 19:18:14 <ober>	sounds like it follows the pattern of the nature of emacs over the years
Apr 23 19:18:23 <grym>	yep
Apr 23 19:18:43 <miskatonic>	paredit works so far quite well with emacs -nw. The debian packager requires gui emacs for it. Is there a hitch or is the packager incompetent?
Apr 23 19:19:06 <grym>	miskatonic: you said debian at least once... 
Apr 23 19:19:15 <grym>	no need to repeat yourself :) 
Apr 23 19:21:03 <ober>	,mitc
Apr 23 19:21:04 <fsbot>	ober: mitc: The person standing in the corner wearing a trench coat, whispering "want some closed source software?"
Apr 23 19:21:06 <bpalmer>	miskatonic: I don't see the requirement in https://packages.debian.org/source/buster/paredit-el . Like other elisp packages, it depends on the emacs virtual  package.
Apr 23 19:21:37 <bpalmer>	well, it depends on emacsen-common and recommends the emacs virtual package
Apr 23 19:21:52 <bpalmer>	no, not virtual, metapackage
Apr 23 19:22:16 <miskatonic>	I am on stretch, so maybe buster has corrected it
Apr 23 19:23:27 <bpalmer>	https://packages.debian.org/stretch/paredit-el depends on emacs which is satisfied by emacs24-nox
Apr 23 19:24:38 <grym>	i make kelleyk handle my deb emacs needs
Apr 23 19:33:36 <wgreenhouse>	bandali: I'm really glad of a potential resolution of this quandary that involves nobody doing much of anything. :)
Apr 23 19:34:12 <bandali>	:-)
Apr 23 19:34:42 <miskatonic>	mmm in stretch, "emacs" is a metapackage and not a virtual package ... big difference
Apr 23 19:36:46 <thblt>	The virtual package is emacsen, apparently. Probably rarely used.
Apr 23 19:37:07 <bremner>	well, there's that one guy who still cares about xemacs
Apr 23 19:38:08 <miskatonic>	which one guy? certainly not RMS
Apr 23 19:39:11 <lampilelo>	i don't think rms uses debian
Apr 23 19:39:46 <thblt>	I have a whetstone emergency, but the country is in lockdown for some two more weeks.  Poor knife.
Apr 23 19:40:19 <lampilelo>	try dhrystone
Apr 23 19:40:23 <bremner>	lampilelo: I'm pretty sure rms does not use xemacs, which was a hostile fork of gnu emacs
Apr 23 19:41:13 <miskatonic>	oh, I understood that there is globally only one person to care about xemacs, with or without a particular os/distro
Apr 23 19:41:40 <lampilelo>	i know, bremner 
Apr 23 19:42:10 <bremner>	well whoosh me sideways
Apr 23 19:42:21 <bandali>	lol
Apr 23 19:42:31 <bandali>	i stumbled upon this a while ago: https://stallman.org/articles/xemacs.origin
Apr 23 19:42:52 <wasamasa>	the origin story?
Apr 23 19:43:11 <rpav>	anyone tried dap-mode
Apr 23 19:43:13 <bandali>	yeah
Apr 23 19:43:26 <rpav>	gud just seems broken :(
Apr 23 19:43:33 <miskatonic>	20 years ago, most xemacs users were redhatters ... but that may have been a Germany-only coincidence
Apr 23 19:51:35 <wgreenhouse>	hay, there's at least two people in this channel who care about xemacs
Apr 23 19:52:00 <wgreenhouse>	bpalmer, and sometimes Steve Youngs (the sxemacs maintainer) is in here
Apr 23 19:52:24 <rpav>	is xemacs still a thing?
Apr 23 19:53:07 <rpav>	updated a lot more recently than i expected actually
Apr 23 19:53:45 <wgreenhouse>	they were a window manager a lot earlier than gnu emacs, so arguably they're still anticipating our evolution. :P
Apr 23 19:53:55 <wgreenhouse>	,xwem
Apr 23 19:53:56 <fsbot>	xwem is a  WM implemented for XEmacs <http://emacswiki.org/XWindowEmacsManager>
Apr 23 20:01:06 <miskatonic>	there is now exwm or something similar, a much better window manager based on emacs
Apr 23 20:07:37 <skangas>	bandali: It would be useful if you replied to the thread on emacs-devel, thanks.
Apr 23 20:09:57 <skangas>	Regarding XEmacs, last year they had less commits for the full year than GNU Emacs had some *days*.
Apr 23 20:10:47 <mplsCorwin>	+1
Apr 23 20:11:40 <mplsCorwin>	sorry.  +1 is RE it would be useful if you will point out the existing officaldom, etc., bandali
Apr 23 20:19:08 <grym>	wgreenhouse: "not doing anything" is the academia slowroll 101 
Apr 23 20:19:14 <grym>	it's a fine life 
Apr 23 20:19:24 <bandali>	skangas, mplsCorwin, cheers; will do so later tonight
Apr 23 20:30:08 <bpalmer>	it's not clear to me what consensus has been reached. "The irc channel #emacs is already listed on gnu.org. Cheers." ?
Apr 23 20:33:40 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: what is bpalmer talking about?
Apr 23 20:33:41 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: bpalmer`: alignment my car is perfectly aligned bro i dun no what your talking about you saying because I wrote PHP I dont know stuff bro
Apr 23 20:34:01 <grym>	bpalmer: lgtm ship it 
Apr 23 20:36:40 <bandali>	bpalmer, what wgreenhouse wrote to me and tromey above
Apr 23 20:39:40 <wgreenhouse>	bpalmer: in summary, we're already a gnu channel; our policies match up with other gnu channels, and we've already got johnsu01 and johnw as ops
Apr 23 20:42:35 <rpav>	holy crap i accidentally pressed C-h l and facepalm .. i set up a command log thing just to track this, sigh
Apr 23 20:43:04 <rpav>	i think emacs will never fail to have undiscovered corners
Apr 23 20:43:31 <miskatonic>	rudybot: do you care about xemacs?
Apr 23 20:43:37 <rudybot>	miskatonic: "I most certainly do care about XEmacs!"
Apr 23 20:43:49 <bandali>	rpav, which-key may help you explore/discover more of it :-)
Apr 23 20:44:45 <wgreenhouse>	bpalmer: which I suppose you could read as "don't annex us, #emacs has always been part of #gnu"
Apr 23 20:44:49 <rpav>	hah, yet another handy thing, nice
Apr 23 20:45:46 <noobly>	any tips on getting pdf-tools annotations to display as the actual annotations, not just icons?
Apr 23 20:47:39 <dale>	noobly: They display as icons in pdf-tools, or in other PDF readers?
Apr 23 20:48:53 <bpalmer>	I feel like there's a rewrite of history going on.
Apr 23 20:49:32 *	bpalmer shrugs for now.
Apr 23 20:58:45 <bandali>	what rewrite of history?
Apr 23 20:59:14 <lxsameer>	hey folks, how can i execute several external processes in async mode and wait for all of them to finish ? I need to collect their stdout and stderr as well
Apr 23 20:59:14 <lxsameer>	make-process ?
Apr 23 20:59:48 <miskatonic>	the takover of #emacs by xemacs
Apr 23 21:01:26 <holomorph>	lxsameer: if you need stdout and stderr separately, i think you have to use make-process
Apr 23 21:02:07 <holomorph>	to do something when they all finish, you can give the processes sentinels that keep track of a counter
Apr 23 21:02:23 <lxsameer>	holomorph: nice. thanks 
Apr 23 21:03:31 <miskatonic>	even one async process is often a pain in the rear 
Apr 23 21:07:37 <aidalgol>	technomancy: FWIW, someone I used to work with had some special dev board that let them charge a device via USB while also using the port for data.
Apr 23 21:38:30 <arwn>	Hey how can I delete all of the default menu-bar menus in order to create my onw?
Apr 23 21:40:21 <technomancy>	aidalgol: oh reeeeeally
Apr 23 21:40:25 <technomancy>	I should take another look, huh
Apr 23 21:44:51 <rpav>	heh larry ellison behind the hydroxychloroquine delusion?
Apr 23 21:45:03 <rpav>	ellision is definitely the real actual devil
Apr 23 21:47:19 <john2x>	hello :wave:

Apr 23 22:04:52 <wgreenhouse>	rpav: it seems common for these guys to have really weird medical beliefs 
Apr 23 22:05:13 <zeta_0>	i used this code to setup the elm-language-server, but it does not work when i open an elm file?
Apr 23 22:06:04 <wgreenhouse>	zeta_0: is M-x lsp the command you call to start the server by hand?
Apr 23 22:06:27 <hodapp>	rpav: one thing I'm curious on is if they've done controlled trials on the full treatment people kept touting - hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc. so far I've seen only combinations of the first two parts.
Apr 23 22:07:20 <hodapp>	and people* keep clamoring about why the zinc is actually** the crucial part of that
Apr 23 22:07:49 <rpav>	hodapp: pretty sure there was just a study completed that the former at least if anything made people worse
Apr 23 22:08:12 <rpav>	isn't azithromycin an AB? i'm not sure why that would even have an effect
Apr 23 22:08:29 <zeta_0>	wgreenhouse: when i run that command it tells me that there are not servers supporting that current mode, but i do have elm-languages-server installed?
Apr 23 22:08:37 <hodapp>	rpav: the study that just happened, I thought, did hydroxychloroquine & azithromycin
Apr 23 22:08:50 <wgreenhouse>	zeta_0: then it sounds like you have a further problem 
Apr 23 22:09:06 <wgreenhouse>	Why isn't the elm language server loaded?
Apr 23 22:09:36 <hodapp>	and AFAIK, yes, azithromycin is that, but I know sometimes antibiotics are used to prevent complications from bacteria that can happen alonside. either that or I am talking out my ass.
Apr 23 22:09:57 <rpav>	dunno, unqualified/ignorant people make wild unfounded medical claims all the time, it's just funny this one was by probably one of the most malevolent / misanthropic individuals there is ;)
Apr 23 22:10:11 <zeta_0>	wgreenhouse: i don't know, none of the instructions said that i need to setup env vars
Apr 23 22:10:18 <hodapp>	I have heard so many people's shitty theories of why zinc *must* be effective that I really just want some good data that actually tests the treatment they keep touting (even if they'll just ignore it)
Apr 23 22:10:42 <rpav>	nah pretty sure you're right, secondary infections or whatnot happen
Apr 23 22:10:58 <wgreenhouse>	zeta_0: well it sounds like the use-package invocation is doing what it should but some other piece is missing
Apr 23 22:11:51 <wgreenhouse>	Zinc is used in some OTC cold remedies ("supplements") that were dinged in .us for unverified claims
Apr 23 22:12:10 <wgreenhouse>	It is toxic to some viruses but mostly makes you lose your sense of smell.
Apr 23 22:12:18 <hodapp>	that and I am really tired of people parroting that one doctor had a "100% success rate" and "0 complications"
Apr 23 22:12:30 <hodapp>	basically no treatment has a track record like that
Apr 23 22:13:05 <zeta_0>	wgreenhouse: this is my lsp config in my .emacs: https://dpaste.org/fzJA
Apr 23 22:13:47 <zeta_0>	i'm not sure what the elm-language-server is missing for it to work?
Apr 23 22:14:48 <hodapp>	wgreenhouse: oh, I had thought that the zinc losenges had some data (not great data, just data) to back up that they shortened common cold duration by a day or two if taken right at the onset
Apr 23 22:15:48 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: the lozenges do a little; the nasal sprays and swabs make you lose your sense of smell. :P
Apr 23 22:16:07 <hodapp>	wgreenhouse: like, permanently?
Apr 23 22:16:13 <wgreenhouse>	the lozenges do too, aiui, but are mildly effective 
Apr 23 22:17:04 <wgreenhouse>	hodapp: I don't remember 
Apr 23 22:17:37 <wgreenhouse>	zeta_0: I see you're adding hooks for the lsp minor mode. What is supposed to be loading the server side? 
Apr 23 22:23:17 <zeta_0>	ok, i change my .emacs a little bit, i removed the parenthesis that was wrapped with the :hook https://dpaste.org/FWPM
Apr 23 22:23:20 <rpav>	gah, wtf keeps resetting my c-offsets-alist
Apr 23 22:23:51 <zeta_0>	wgreenhouse: i don't know, i've never had problems with lsp before, everything usually works out of the box
Apr 23 22:25:20 <ryouma>	,lgtm
Apr 23 22:25:21 <fsbot>	ryouma: LGTM is Looks Good To Me
Apr 23 22:26:56 <ryouma>	goatish: org ts overlays are the right solution if theyworkf or you.  they are a bit limited.  org discussed tz and basically dropped the idea of supporting them.  that is, all timestamps are local to the clock of the os you ran emacs on when you inserted them.

Apr 23 23:52:39 <zeta_0>	when i open a .elm file emacs throws this error? https://dpaste.org/yH98
Apr 24 00:01:17 <wgreenhouse>	zeta_0: that error is telling you you are trying to activate lsp on a buffer that's in fundamental-mode

Apr 24 00:01:29 <wgreenhouse>	*elm-mode
Apr 24 00:11:08 <butterthebuddha>	Is it possible to launch a GUI frame from the terminal?
Apr 24 00:11:17 <butterthebuddha>	I'm using emacs-mac which doesn't support emacsclient :(
Apr 24 00:11:31 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Are you absolutely sure it doesn't support emacsclient?  I am 99.9% sure it used to, at least.
Apr 24 00:11:38 <dale>	butterthebuddha: In particular, what makes you say it doesn't support it?
Apr 24 00:11:48 <butterthebuddha>	dale: if it does, it doesn't ship with an emacsclient binary
Apr 24 00:12:20 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Look in Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin
Apr 24 00:12:22 <butterthebuddha>	Oh wait sorry, it doesn't support emacsclient for GUI
Apr 24 00:12:50 <cvandusen>	What does that mean?
Apr 24 00:13:12 <butterthebuddha>	cvandusen: emacsclient launches a frame in the terminal
Apr 24 00:13:29 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Are you sure you're running the emacsclient that came with the Mac port?
Apr 24 00:13:38 <butterthebuddha>	Yep
Apr 24 00:14:06 <butterthebuddha>	I'm using emacs-mac-26.3-7.7 from nixpkgs btw
Apr 24 00:14:30 <dale>	butterthebuddha: And you've run M-x server-start in your GUI Emacs?
Apr 24 00:14:37 <butterthebuddha>	dale: my Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS directory only contains a "Emacs" and "Emacs.app" file
Apr 24 00:14:44 <butterthebuddha>	there is no bin directory
Apr 24 00:15:27 <cvandusen>	What does `which emacsclient` report? 
Apr 24 00:15:30 <dale>	butterthebuddha: Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs.app is a *file* and not a directory?
Apr 24 00:31:57 <spudpnds>	butterthebuddha: /whatever/whatever/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs <--- that's the binary. 
Apr 24 00:36:51 <iqubic>	God... Why is exwm screwing me over?
Apr 24 00:38:46 <zeta_0>	how strange, i never setup any fundamental-mode, how do i make sure that when i open a .elm file that it uses elm-mode instead?
Apr 24 00:40:12 <michaelrose>	zeta_0: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(".*zathurarc" . conf-mode)) its an alist of regexes and modes
Apr 24 00:40:55 <michaelrose>	usually a major mode does something like this automatically for files with the common extension for a language
Apr 24 00:49:28 <zeta_0>	michaelrose: i added that piece of code to my .emacs config, but that did not work, it's still in fundamental-mode?
Apr 24 00:50:11 <zeta_0>	michaelrose: https://dpaste.org/QCvZ
Apr 24 00:51:48 <zeta_0>	dsal: do you use elm-language-server in emacs? i'm having trouble getting it to activate when i open an elm file
Apr 24 00:52:20 <butterypancake>	in the snippet zeta_0 sent, they add ".*zathurarc" to the auto-mode-alist variable. do you need to put the ".*"? I think not but idk
Apr 24 00:54:39 <butterypancake>	iqubic: exwm is lots of fun :P is it that you're entire UI is freezing? Because I do enjoy when that happens
Apr 24 00:55:16 <iqubic>	No. That's not the issue. This issue is that I can't get this one program to be floating properly.
Apr 24 00:55:56 <butterypancake>	Can't help you there. I very much enjoy this line of my config: (exwm-manage-force-tiling t)
Apr 24 00:56:00 <butterypancake>	no floating for me
Apr 24 00:56:31 <ryouma>	is exwm a good wm independent of its emacsness?  do you run a separate instance of emacs?
Apr 24 00:56:56 <butterypancake>	oh shit. Can you do that? I currently run only one emacs but when it freezes I'm kinda screwed
Apr 24 00:57:11 <technomancy>	butterypancake: you can nest emacs instances easily
Apr 24 00:57:14 <technomancy>	I do that for mu4e
Apr 24 00:57:30 <butterypancake>	but which emacs receives the input when you input?
Apr 24 00:57:47 <technomancy>	butterypancake: if the nested one is focused, it receives the input
Apr 24 00:57:54 <technomancy>	butterypancake: the nested emacs would be in char-mode
Apr 24 00:58:17 <ryouma>	in term?
Apr 24 00:58:29 <iqubic>	I'm trying to set-up exwm-manage-configurations properly, but I can't seem to make it work.
Apr 24 00:59:02 <butterypancake>	I never did figure out the difference between line and char mode. I'm starting to realize why whenver I accidently get nested emacs I don't know what to do. 
Apr 24 00:59:28 <technomancy>	butterypancake: char-mode means every key binding is passed directly thru
Apr 24 00:59:39 <technomancy>	so C-x 2, etc affects the inner emacs, not the outer one
Apr 24 01:00:10 <butterypancake>	this knowledge will prove useful. Thank you very much. No more force shutting down the accidental nested emacs for me!
Apr 24 01:00:14 <ryouma>	except for exceptions which i always forget
Apr 24 01:00:29 <ryouma>	c-c or something
Apr 24 01:01:01 <butterypancake>	sounds complicated. I'll prolly stick with 1 emacs unless someone makes a convincing case
Apr 24 01:01:16 <ryouma>	i was just thinkiing a separate emacs
Apr 24 01:01:25 <ryouma>	like, run emacs again
Apr 24 01:01:50 <butterypancake>	what the heck is this exwm-manage-configurations variable? aren't there like individual variables for everything this single variable controls?
Apr 24 01:02:15 <wgreenhouse>	butterypancake: it's a way of matching and applying conditions to groups of windows
Apr 24 01:02:21 <butterypancake>	oh, it's per application. I'm dumb
Apr 24 01:02:33 <butterypancake>	thanks wgreenhouse 
Apr 24 01:02:43 <iqubic>	I really wish this worked for me:
Apr 24 01:02:44 <iqubic>	http://dpaste.com/1FDAP78
Apr 24 01:03:38 <michaelrose>	zeta_0: you weren't supposed to paste it you were supposed to modify it by adding the correct regex and mode
Apr 24 01:03:55 <butterypancake>	try a customize-set-variable instead of setq. Some of the exwm variables need to be set at a specific time or done through customize
Apr 24 01:04:36 <iqubic>	Oh, do they? I didn't know that.
Apr 24 01:04:49 <iqubic>	I'm just trying to test this out.
Apr 24 01:04:54 <butterypancake>	ya, that variable has some logic attached to it so you should use customize
Apr 24 01:05:34 <iqubic>	Oh, I didn't know that.
Apr 24 01:05:57 <zeta_0>	michaelrose: do you mean like this? https://dpaste.org/BAVA
Apr 24 01:05:58 <butterypancake>	if you look at a variable and it says you can customize it, it really means you really really should
Apr 24 01:06:17 <butterypancake>	cuz then you get type checking and possibly it'll run some functions when you set it
Apr 24 01:06:18 <michaelrose>	zeta_0: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.elm$" . elm-mode)) 
Apr 24 01:06:41 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: i've always have trouble with that, i prefer to use setq in my .emacs config
Apr 24 01:07:03 <butterypancake>	probably because you're setting some variables wrong ;)
Apr 24 01:07:29 <butterypancake>	if you are setting variables correctly, and don't mind quoting the second argument, setq == customize-set-variable
Apr 24 01:07:47 <michaelrose>	zeta_0: yours says that any file which is any character followed by elm for example the file literally named belm would match, regex 101 . means any character $ means ends in, if you want the literal character you use a backslash to escape
Apr 24 01:08:15 <iqubic>	technomancy: I know you're an EXWM pro, what would you say is the right way to set those variables?
Apr 24 01:08:29 <michaelrose>	"\.elm$" means the the string which ends in the literal character period followed by e l m
Apr 24 01:08:31 <butterypancake>	but yes my .emacs is ugly cuz customize-set-variable is way to long and it doesn't accept multiple values at once
Apr 24 01:08:46 <technomancy>	iqubic: I must be on an old version of exwm; that variable doesn't even exist for me
Apr 24 01:08:54 <iqubic>	Oh. I see.
Apr 24 01:09:07 <iqubic>	How would you do something like this?
Apr 24 01:09:30 <butterypancake>	but if you open that variable in source code, you'll see it has a ':set' value. this gets run when it's customized but not when you setq it
Apr 24 01:10:51 <zeta_0>	ok, i set that piece of code in my .emacs, i'll test it out now: (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.elm$" . elm-mode))
Apr 24 01:11:08 <iqubic>	I see. What specifically does it do when I set it via customize?
Apr 24 01:11:46 <butterypancake>	now this doesn't always matter. for example, if you set your exwm global keys before exwm is loaded, everything is fine. however, if you set the keys after it's loaded, they won't update. If you customize this variable, it runs some code to make sure it applies properlly
Apr 24 01:12:20 <butterypancake>	idk. The code is complicated. it might not do anything useful like I said above. all I know is that it exists. and it proably exists for a reason
Apr 24 01:13:30 <butterypancake>	if you're using use-package, check out the ':custom' option. it makes using customize sexy
Apr 24 01:15:29 <zeta_0>	michaelrose: that caused it to throw an error when i opened an elm file? https://dpaste.org/aMM0
Apr 24 01:15:56 <dsal>	zeta_0: I don't use any language servers.
Apr 24 01:17:03 <iqubic>	I am using use package.
Apr 24 01:17:34 <butterypancake>	if you're using use package, you need to be using :custom
Apr 24 01:17:49 <zeta_0>	dsal: oh, just that i'd ask, for the most part i've been very happy with lsp in emacs, but for some reason, elm-language-server is not being activated when i open an elm file
Apr 24 01:18:02 <butterypancake>	 (use-package exwm :custom (exwm-workspace-show-all-buffers t) (exwm-layout-show-all-buffers t))
Apr 24 01:18:31 <butterypancake>	Look at how sexy that is. I customized two variables and it took less characters than setq
Apr 24 01:18:37 <dsal>	zeta_0: last time I tried lsp, things went horribly wrong and I just went back to regular emacs modes and dante.  I should give it a shot again someday.
Apr 24 01:19:01 <iqubic>	What does that custom variable do?
Apr 24 01:19:30 <butterypancake>	it's equivlant to doing (customize-set-variable 'exwm-workspace-show-all-buffers t)
Apr 24 01:19:40 <zeta_0>	dsal: lsp works really nice with nix
Apr 24 01:19:54 <iqubic>	butterypancake: Can't I just run (customie-set-variable) myself?
Apr 24 01:20:25 <ryouma>	michaelrose: emacs regexP 101 says the $ is actually eol not eos.  for eos, try '.  :)

Apr 24 01:20:51 <butterypancake>	iqubic: ya, but it's way to long a function name and you have to write that function name out for every single variable. It looks icky. but doing it using use-package is epic
Apr 24 01:20:54 <iqubic>	I see.
Apr 24 01:21:21 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: is this what you meant by using :custon? https://dpaste.org/or2A
Apr 24 01:21:50 <butterypancake>	one sec zeta_0 there is a better way but I need to look it up
Apr 24 01:22:16 <ryouma>	here
Apr 24 01:22:25 <ryouma>	‘\'’ matches the empty string, but only at the end of the buffer or string being matched against. -- (info "(elisp) Regexp Backslash")
Apr 24 01:22:47 <ryouma>	dunno if similar in non emacs regexp but it includes buffer ehre
Apr 24 01:23:19 <zeta_0>	when setting up haskell with lsp, all i had to do was copy and paste the code from the instructions into .emacs, but for elm there's not any defauld elisp code to paste into .emacs, so i'm probably missing something
Apr 24 01:23:22 <butterypancake>	 (use-package lsp-mode :mode ("\\.elm$" . elm-mode))
Apr 24 01:24:00 <michaelrose>	that is really useful
Apr 24 01:24:23 <butterypancake>	the :mode thing in use package is specific for adding to the alist thingy and it also defers loading of the package until you open a .elm file
Apr 24 01:24:23 <zeta_0>	and then all those elm people hang out on slack, so it's a hard to contact them if you don't use slack
Apr 24 01:24:36 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: thanks, i'll test that out now to see if it works
Apr 24 01:25:42 <butterypancake>	zeta_0: the problem though is if you want to use lsp-mode on files other than elm-mode. so if you don't wan't to defer the loading so you can use it with other files also add a :ensure t
Apr 24 01:28:03 <butterypancake>	zeta_0: actually your custom thing was really bad. you need to add to the auto-mode-alist, but you overwrote it losing what it already contained (which is a lot). also, that variable doesn't benifit from customize. It's not bad (other than the over write bit) but no-one has added type checking to that variable for custom
Apr 24 01:28:24 <ober>	using org-next-block gets me to the next babel block, but can't find a org-babel-jump-to-end
Apr 24 01:28:52 <butterypancake>	how come all the values in auto-mode-alist end in \\'? is that the end of line symbol?
Apr 24 01:29:36 <ryouma>	butterypancake: see above
Apr 24 01:29:48 <butterypancake>	ryouma: sorry I'm bad a reading
Apr 24 01:29:48 <ryouma>	if your filename has a newline
Apr 24 01:30:01 <ryouma>	not voice enabled and not able to speak atm
Apr 24 01:35:37 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: it threw an error: https://dpaste.org/SMpu https://dpaste.org/notV
Apr 24 01:37:10 <butterypancake>	you have :mode twice
Apr 24 01:37:10 <zeta_0>	ya, the elm-language-server repo needs to add more emacs documentation so i'm not stuck like this
Apr 24 01:37:19 <zeta_0>	oh typo, my mistake
Apr 24 01:37:19 <butterypancake>	also replace $ with \\'
Apr 24 01:37:27 <butterypancake>	just for consistency with the other auto-mode regexes
Apr 24 01:39:32 <butterypancake>	zeta_0: could I get your full use-package snippet?
Apr 24 01:41:23 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: ok i made the changes you suggested, i'll test it out now and here's my full lsp config of my .emacs: https://dpaste.org/mL41
Apr 24 01:45:54 <butterypancake>	ok I see some things you should change but I can't figure out how to use dpaste.org
Apr 24 01:46:48 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: it threw another error when i opened a elm file? https://dpaste.org/i9Bj
Apr 24 01:47:19 <butterypancake>	one sec. I see some things wrong
Apr 24 01:47:24 <zeta_0>	i didn't think that it would be this difficult to get elm lsp setup
Apr 24 01:49:24 <butterypancake>	https://dpaste.org/Y52H
Apr 24 01:49:46 <butterypancake>	well I don't think you should have that thing in the :hook section. I'm pretty sure that's wrong
Apr 24 01:50:23 <butterypancake>	you can probably ignore the part where i replace a setq with a customize-set-variable. That's just me pushing my custom agenda
Apr 24 01:51:32 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: thanks, i'll make the changes right now, one second
Apr 24 01:57:53 <butterypancake>	ok. I made a butt load of changes that I think make it better. just diff this snippet with the old one to see my changes
Apr 24 01:57:53 <butterypancake>	https://dpaste.org/9kgt
Apr 24 01:58:31 <butterypancake>	btw I have no clue how lsp works. I don't think I've added any errors. I think I might have corrected some. But I can't judge any lsp specific stuff
Apr 24 01:59:48 <butterypancake>	Your hooks where quite mangeled. 
Apr 24 02:08:34 <jamzattack>	pretty sure that should be clojurescript-mode instead of clojurescript-mode-hook in the :hook section of (use-package lsp).
Apr 24 02:09:25 <butterypancake>	that sounds right. did I make a boo-boo
Apr 24 02:09:41 <butterypancake>	yes I did make a boo-boo. Thanks jamzattack!
Apr 24 02:14:19 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: thanks, i'll add the changes and let you know if it works or not
Apr 24 02:14:52 <butterypancake>	I'll probably be offline by then but good luck!
Apr 24 02:15:27 <zeta_0>	butterypancake: well if you leave before then, thanks for the help
Apr 24 02:18:16 <rwp>	Does anyone know if it is possible to disable a .dir-locals.el file globally?  In that I never want it unless I enable it?
Apr 24 02:18:54 <rwp>	I sometimes browse source that includes it and it is a nuisance to have to say 'n' every time I open a new file.
Apr 24 02:19:23 <butterypancake>	Never tried but you could try and figure out what hook it is and remove it from the file open hooks list
Apr 24 02:20:23 <rwp>	This seems to be something that is new in Emacs.  Because I never ran into it in older versions.
Apr 24 02:20:32 <rwp>	But it is smacking in the face like stepping on a rake now.
Apr 24 02:20:53 <jamzattack>	enable-dir-local-variables
Apr 24 02:21:14 <butterypancake>	says it was in emacs 24.4 so it's been around a while
Apr 24 02:22:20 <rwp>	jamzattack, That was it!  Disabling that solves my stepping on the rake problem.  THANKS!
Apr 24 02:24:02 <rwp>	butterypancake, This seems to be something that is not documented in Emacs 25.  Comparing 25 to 26 I see it in the info docs for 26 but not for 25.
Apr 24 02:26:09 <butterypancake>	there is a news entry for 24.4 saying they added the variable. but maybe default behaviour changed more recently?
Apr 24 02:26:26 <rwp>	butterypancake, Regardless of not being documented in 25 it triggers just the same there.  Same default.  Just not documented.
Apr 24 02:26:45 *	rwp wonders where I have Emacs 24 still sitting around to go compare with...
Apr 24 02:27:26 <butterypancake>	well, I'm out. Good night
Apr 24 02:27:34 <rwp>	Thanks butterypancake!  Good night!
Apr 24 02:29:46 <rwp>	Triggers exactly the same in Emacs 24 too.  Now looking for Emacs 23...
Apr 24 02:30:47 <jamzattack>	23 is when dir-locals was first implemented
Apr 24 02:31:31 <rwp>	I just tried Emacs 23 and it also triggers the same.
Apr 24 02:31:49 <rwp>	But I guess it was live for a while before the documentation appeared in 26.  Hmm...
Apr 24 02:32:49 <rwp>	No, it is documented in 23 too.  Just in a different spot in the info docs.  That is what confused me.  They moved the section around apparently.
Apr 24 02:33:12 <rwp>	I guess I have satisfied my curiosity about it enough...
Apr 24 02:33:33 <rwp>	Thanks jamzattack for the pointer to enable-dir-local-variables as that was just what I needed!
Apr 24 02:43:40 <ober>	is there any way to determine the size of a region selected?
Apr 24 02:44:34 <ober>	count-lines-region.
Apr 24 02:45:00 <jlf>	,next
Apr 24 02:45:05 <fsbot>	Another satisfied customer. NEXT!
Apr 24 02:59:54 <zeta_0>	i made those elm changes in my .emacs config butt errors are still being thrown? https://dpaste.org/rrLC
Apr 24 03:01:13 <zeta_0>	https://dpaste.org/wLMf
Apr 24 03:01:20 <zeta_0>	what's going on here? ^
Apr 24 03:02:33 <zeta_0>	that butterfly dude helped me a lot, but now errors are still being thrown, setting up elm-language-server has been harder than i thought
Apr 24 03:03:52 <jamzattack>	lsp-mode.el doesn't define elm-mode, so elm stuff should be in (use-package elm-mode) or manually autoloaded in the :init section
Apr 24 03:07:36 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: isn't it defined here? https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/lsp-elm.el
Apr 24 03:07:58 <zeta_0>	a paste bin would be nice, i'm not sure what you mean?
Apr 24 03:10:07 <jamzattack>	The function `elm-mode' isn't defined there.  It's defined in a different package.  So either (autoload 'elm-mode "elm-mode") or put the auto-mode-alist bit in (use-package elm-mode)
Apr 24 03:11:05 <ober>	anyway to escape org-mode syntax in a babel block string added via append-to-file history.org?
Apr 24 03:13:53 <zeta_0>	some other person says they're using a config similar to mine: https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/g5jfbh/elmlanguageserver_emacs_usepackage_configuration/
Apr 24 03:14:10 <zeta_0>	but ok, i'll try your method
Apr 24 03:15:18 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: does (autoload 'elm-mode "elm-mode") need to placed somewhere specific?
Apr 24 03:15:38 <jamzattack>	either in the top level or in the :init section
Apr 24 03:18:07 <ober>	trying to escape things in the string to prevent from breaking the babel block https://gist.github.com/09551cd74f66289a2c76dd7695fbe638
Apr 24 03:19:24 <jamzattack>	(replace-regexp-in-string "^#" ",#" str) ?
Apr 24 03:19:34 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: i think this is what you mean: https://dpaste.org/wXkX
Apr 24 03:19:41 <ober>	yeah but ^* can break it too
Apr 24 03:19:53 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: line 39
Apr 24 03:21:34 <iqubic>	So, I'm trying to do some EXWM configuration stuff. I'm trying to execute this sexp in my .emacs, but it fails.
Apr 24 03:21:48 <iqubic>	http://dpaste.com/2P8686C
Apr 24 03:21:54 <ryouma>	ober: you might want to just call teh equivalent of c-c ' instead to make sure that it is not brittle
Apr 24 03:21:55 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: if that's wrong, then i'll go with the (use-package elm-mode) method instead
Apr 24 03:22:01 <iqubic>	apply: Wrong type argument: symbolp, ((string-match-p "Godot_ProjectList" exwm-instance-name) char-mode t floating t)
Apr 24 03:23:16 <jamzattack>	iqubic: use customize-set-variable
Apr 24 03:24:09 <jamzattack>	or wrap in parens https://ttm.sh/EsJ.txt
Apr 24 03:24:21 <iqubic>	Alright... That brings up the debugger. The error remains is longer but has the same content.
Apr 24 03:24:50 <iqubic>	http://dpaste.com/15BPYKE
Apr 24 03:25:16 <ober>	ryouma: good point. use the binding to do it right
Apr 24 03:25:58 <zeta_0>	jamzattack: it's throwing errors, so i'll try out the (use-package elm-mode) method instead
Apr 24 03:26:16 <jamzattack>	iqubic: if using customize-set-variable you need to quote the first arg
Apr 24 03:26:33 <iqubic>	I'm not. I'm using custom-set-variables
Apr 24 03:26:35 <iqubic>	Debugger entered--Lisp error: (void-function exwm-manage-configurations)
Apr 24 03:27:13 <jamzattack>	then you need to quote the list, see my previous paste
Apr 24 03:28:05 <iqubic>	Which list needs quoting
Apr 24 03:28:17 <jamzattack>	iqubic: both
Apr 24 03:28:25 <iqubic>	I'm using this: http://dpaste.com/0XMDXVJ
Apr 24 03:28:30 <iqubic>	What do I need to change?
Apr 24 03:29:04 <jamzattack>	(custom-set-variables '(exwm-manage-canfigurations ...))
Apr 24 03:29:20 <iqubic>	Yeah. I got it.
Apr 24 03:31:16 <jamzattack>	ober: org-escape-code-in-string is what you want
Apr 24 03:34:03 <zeta_0>	ok, how does this look? https://dpaste.org/2nDi
Apr 24 03:34:56 <jamzattack>	shouldn't need to use autoload manually anymore
Apr 24 03:38:21 <zeta_0>	ok, i'll fix that now, the instructions for elm lsp are not very specific, so i feel like i'm in the dark: https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server#emacs
Apr 24 03:40:56 <ober>	thanks JM0
Apr 24 03:41:45 <zeta_0>	ok, i fixed it, there's no errors being thrown, so i'll test it out now to see if it works: https://dpaste.org/AdFW
Apr 24 03:45:09 <zeta_0>	it's still throwing the same error: https://dpaste.org/YGrX
Apr 24 03:45:34 <jamzattack>	did you install elm-mode??
Apr 24 03:45:36 <fsbot>	Signs point to yes!
Apr 24 03:48:35 <zeta_0>	damn i completely forgot to install it, one second
Apr 24 03:48:39 <zeta_0>	today is not my day
Apr 24 03:48:39 <jamzattack>	hahaha that'd be it...
Apr 24 03:48:42 <iqubic>	Is there an exwm function to set a given window to be tiling?
Apr 24 03:50:29 <jamzattack>	iqubic: there's exwm-floating--unset-floating, not interactive
Apr 24 03:51:08 <iqubic>	I don't need it to be interactive. I'm putting this an update-title-hook
Apr 24 03:51:42 <iqubic>	But the question is, how do I get the right ID to pass in to that?
Apr 24 03:52:15 <jamzattack>	(exwm--buffer->id BUFFER)
Apr 24 03:56:58 <iqubic>	jamzattack: I'm creating this hook. http://dpaste.com/3JNXXG5
Apr 24 03:57:15 <iqubic>	I don't know what to put in the place of those 3 ???.
Apr 24 03:59:21 <jamzattack>	https://0x0.st/ijLb.txt is what I got
Apr 24 03:59:46 <iqubic>	And now other stuff isn't working.
Apr 24 04:00:49 <iqubic>	I went back to a simpler config, and it isn't working either.
Apr 24 04:00:49 <iqubic>	http://dpaste.com/0JFE47Z
Apr 24 04:01:17 <iqubic>	This should set all new X windows to be char-mode. But it just doesn't.
Apr 24 04:01:44 <jamzattack>	(custom-set-variables '(exwm-manage-configurations '((t char-mode t)))) you missed a set of parens
Apr 24 04:02:09 <iqubic>	Ah. I see.
Apr 24 04:02:19 <zeta_0>	i'm going to do a quick reboot, i'll be back in a bit
Apr 24 04:04:28 <iqubic>	What the hell is this?
Apr 24 04:06:00 <iqubic>	exwm-floating--unset-floating requires an ID. exwm-input-release-keyboard has an optional ID argument. exwm-layout-show-mode-line doesn't take any arguments. What the hell is this madness?
Apr 24 04:07:22 <jamzattack>	yeah it's a bit of a mess. Generally it's just the non-interactive functions that require an id
Apr 24 04:08:24 <iqubic>	Is there a non-interactive way of setting the input mode to char?
Apr 24 04:09:03 <iqubic>	Or rather... Non-interact way to show the modeline again.
Apr 24 04:10:14 <jamzattack>	Why not just use the interactive one?
Apr 24 04:10:16 <deerpig>	For some reason, the first [git] commit of the morning is always the hardest of all.
Apr 24 04:10:39 <iqubic>	I want to make sure the right window is target with that function.
Apr 24 04:11:29 <jamzattack>	could use (with-current-buffer ...)
Apr 24 04:11:47 <jamzattack>	otherwise copy exwm-layout-shouw-mode-line and add an argument
Apr 24 04:12:07 <iqubic>	Nah. I think I'll just use with-current-buffer.
Apr 24 04:16:31 <iqubic>	Why is there no hook for when the instance name changes?
Apr 24 04:17:48 <iqubic>	Something in this is malformed, and I don't know what it is.
Apr 24 04:18:04 <iqubic>	http://dpaste.com/3SRC80D
Apr 24 04:18:20 <zeta_0>	ok, installing elm-mode fixed it, i just need to test out elm-language-server to make sure it's working correctly

Apr 24 05:32:20 <ryouma>	google translate is horrendous at japanese->english but it does know kanji usually and can transliterate.

Apr 24 05:45:03 <ryouma>	is that the same char?
Apr 24 05:45:03 <evanmeek>	好 means of english is OK

Apr 24 05:46:01 <evanmeek>	nihao is chinese pinyin
Apr 24 05:46:26 <deerpig>	It's used in Japanese to mean fondness, in Chinese it means all right, good, if memory serves
Apr 24 05:46:57 <deerpig>	if my memory serves that is
Apr 24 05:47:06 <sloppone>	si si si
Apr 24 05:47:09 <ryouma>	that makes sense but i had the mistaken notion that it was japanese only char

Apr 24 06:03:37 <homerj>	former rule 5 pick for the Pirates Evan Meek?
Apr 24 06:08:08 <codingquark>	Hello jamzattack!
Apr 24 06:20:52 <aidalgol>	homerj: wat?
Apr 24 06:24:32 <fengshaun>	hmm Ivy doesn't even recognize plink: as a tramp protocol
Apr 24 06:24:33 <fengshaun>	and does some weird things with path
Apr 24 06:31:15 <fengshaun>	there is no winning, helm is slooow and ivy's missing features :S
Apr 24 06:38:35 <ryouma>	and ido has even fewer!
Apr 24 06:39:55 <ryouma>	ido is all i need for the time being
Apr 24 06:41:04 <PlasmaStrike>	You could look at icomplete or selectrum. the selectrum page has a bunch of comparisions for compleatin frameworks
Apr 24 06:42:10 <afidegnum>	what's the best package to use? i tried helm with no success.... let's say, before running a function, i want to be presented with few parameters. i.e username: "i fill" channel: "i fill"    etc... 
Apr 24 06:42:22 <afidegnum>	once the parameters are exhauxted, the funciton runs
Apr 24 06:42:46 <afidegnum>	any package close to that ?
Apr 24 06:45:22 <jamzattack>	just use a bunch of (read-string)s?
Apr 24 06:48:04 <afidegnum>	jamzattack: that will be tedious, i think there is a handy package for it 
Apr 24 07:01:17 <ryouma>	,selectrum
Apr 24 07:01:21 <fsbot>	It's lucky you're going so slowly, because you're going in the wrong direction.
Apr 24 07:01:39 <ryouma>	must be ibmum
Apr 24 07:06:45 <afidegnum>	ryouma: thanks,

Apr 24 07:07:13 <nwoob>	I have one question which is not related to emacs, just a general question: If I am at home connected to my wifi and then I connect to openvpn connection setup by my college, can they see my internet history?
Apr 24 07:07:16 <afidegnum>	i mean how do i work with this ?
Apr 24 07:08:29 <afidegnum>	ryouma: ibmum 404
Apr 24 07:21:20 <homerj>	nwoob, don't look at porn over your school's vpn
Apr 24 07:27:29 <dale>	nwoob: Maybe, depends on how they have it configured.
Apr 24 07:31:16 <PlasmaStrike>	nwoob: Your colloage will be able see you talking to your vpn server, but nothing else besides that. unless they break the encription
Apr 24 07:34:37 <fengshaun>	welp! that was an easy fix, just needed to add /plink: to the hard-coded prefix list in ivy--magic-file-slash
Apr 24 07:34:48 <fengshaun>	also, wow edebug-defun is cool
Apr 24 07:35:17 <fengshaun>	I should make a patch and send it in over the weekend
Apr 24 07:47:50 <homerj>	which is why you generally use two network interfaces
Apr 24 07:48:00 <homerj>	attach one to the VPN, but have everything go out your normal one
Apr 24 07:48:18 <homerj>	then just edit your routing table for things that need VPN

Apr 24 09:27:10 <afidegnum>	how do i represent options in elisp/emacs? i.e where i can select mutiple some items?
Apr 24 09:30:44 <afidegnum>	i want to select a list of few items in an option
Apr 24 09:42:14 <blandest>	afidegnum: completing-read lets you choose an item from a list interactively
Apr 24 09:48:30 <wiz21b>	hello, I've made a simple change to rcirc so that it warns me whenever I send too long of a message (which happened to me yesterday :-( ). Anybody interested ?
Apr 24 09:59:50 <codingquark>	Put it up somewhere. Pretty sure someone would be interested.
Apr 24 10:01:16 <afidegnum>	blandest: what about list of items ?
Apr 24 10:05:42 <jusss>	is there a function can generate random strings?
Apr 24 10:07:03 <Greth>	jusss: do you need them to be random words? You can do (number-to-string (random))
Apr 24 10:07:26 <jusss>	Greth: yes, I need to use them as random buffer name
Apr 24 10:21:49 <Greth>	jusss: sadly don't have a good answer then. The way I would do it is something like: (let ((words '("one" "two" "three"))) (nth (random (length words)) words))
Apr 24 10:44:09 <wasamasa>	truly random buffer names?
Apr 24 10:44:35 <wasamasa>	generate-new-buffer creates new ones based on a name
Apr 24 10:44:51 <wasamasa>	it does so by appending numbers
Apr 24 10:47:46 <lnkcmplxct>	wasamasa I need a more up to date version of emacs than my distro allows for, is it better or more secure to compile the current version from source myself or to use ppa:cassou/emacs ?

Apr 24 11:30:04 <wasamasa>	it's a prefix
Apr 24 11:30:04 <miskatonic>	C-h is a prefix, not a command on its own right
Apr 24 11:30:12 <wasamasa>	if you mean C-h C-h, that's help-for-help
Apr 24 11:31:57 <VladTheImplier>	wasamasa: Ohh, that's why :S  Can I remap the prefix somehow?
Apr 24 11:32:39 <wasamasa>	check help.el for how the bindings are set up
Apr 24 11:32:59 <wasamasa>	f1 is an alias for it
Apr 24 11:35:34 <VladTheImplier>	wasamasa: Ohh! F1, nice! Just in case I still want to remap it, there are is "help.el.gz, ehelp.el.gz, help.elc, ehelp.elc" where do I look to get the reference?
Apr 24 11:36:56 <wasamasa>	I used my favorite search tool and looked for help-for-help
Apr 24 11:37:18 <wasamasa>	then I checked for C-h and f1

Apr 24 12:55:03 <gueorgui>	Is there a way to set up mu4e in a "wide view"? So the list of messages on the left side of the screen, and the message view on the right, rather than list on top and message view on bottom?
Apr 24 13:00:03 <miskatonic>	maybe Esc-Esc_Esc to make the message tesxt buffer disappear, then split the window horizontally, the use buffer-menu to make the text messages appear in one of the new halves
Apr 24 13:00:43 <miskatonic>	i got this to work in some other modes, not tried in mu4e

Oct 15 19:08:48 <ane>	is there a nice way to open up git format-patch emails so that it can be easily edited in e.g. message-mode? right now message-mode kind of gets stuck because it's trying to look for the "text follows this line" crap when adding a To: recipient (or any field)
Oct 15 19:10:46 <ane>	I would like to need minimal modification for the files so that they can be edited with the message-mode tricks
Oct 15 19:18:47 <ksynwa>	In org-mode, shouldn't typing `AB\^C` escape the ^ and avoid the superscript?
Oct 15 19:18:58 <ksynwa>	Seems to not do this in html export.
Oct 15 19:19:48 <grym>	ksynwa: set #+OPTIONS: ^:nil
Oct 15 19:20:30 <ksynwa>	How do I do superscript if I enable that?
Oct 15 19:20:45 <ksynwa>	Not that I need to right now but just wondering in case I need to in the future.
Oct 15 19:20:58 <ksynwa>	Escaping seems pretty cool to me. Was hoping it worked.
Oct 15 19:28:50 <grym>	i don't think that would affect something like $2^5$ on export
Oct 15 19:30:23 <grym>	ksynwa:  If you write ‘^:{}’, ‘a_{b}’ is interpreted, but the simple ‘a_b’ is left as it is (org-export-with-sub-superscripts)

Oct 15 19:47:13 <laertus>	is there some way to submit feature requests for elisp?
Oct 15 19:50:30 <bremner>	how much do you like being abused by greybeards?
Oct 15 19:54:19 <wasamasa>	laertus: M-x report-emacs-bug
Oct 15 19:54:48 <laertus>	even though it's not a bug per-se?
Oct 15 19:55:17 <laertus>	anyway, i'm kind of a greybeard myself... i can take it
Oct 15 19:55:44 <wasamasa>	yes, there's an emacs-devel discussion of aliasing a different command to it for feedback in general
Oct 15 19:55:59 <wasamasa>	and making the system details optional for that case
Oct 15 19:58:15 <laertus>	i was just reading through the cl-defstruct docs, and read this:
Oct 15 19:58:21 <laertus>	"‘:print-function’ In full Common Lisp, this option allows you to specify a function that is called to print an instance of the structure type.  The Emacs Lisp system offers no hooks into the Lisp printer which would allow for such a feature, so this package simply ignores ‘:print-function’."
Oct 15 19:58:42 <laertus>	so i was thinking: why not allow hooks in to the elisp printer?
Oct 15 19:59:16 <laertus>	and i've come across a bunch of other similar statements in the cl package about stuff that elisp doesn't have that makes the package be unable to implement useful stuff
Oct 15 19:59:17 <pjb>	laertus: history?
Oct 15 19:59:29 <laertus>	ok, history for the past
Oct 15 19:59:40 <laertus>	but the future need not be limited by the past
Oct 15 19:59:58 <wasamasa>	have you looked at print.c?
Oct 15 20:00:08 <pjb>	laertus: the history of RMS not liking Common Lisp, and also the fact that the Common Lisp standardization process (started 1984, completed 1996) was parallel to the creation of GNU emacs (started developpement in 1983).
Oct 15 20:00:15 <wasamasa>	granted, it's half the code of lread.c, but still
Oct 15 20:00:20 <laertus>	wasamasa: no, but i've looked at emacs c code before, and it ain't pretty
Oct 15 20:00:24 <wasamasa>	yes indeed
Oct 15 20:00:39 <pjb>	laertus: oh and yes, the fact that half of emacs is written in C instead of lisp. That doesn't help maintainance and improvements…
Oct 15 20:00:59 <laertus>	pjb: well, does scheme have hooks in to its printer and other features that would allow implementing some of these cl features?  i'd bet yes
Oct 15 20:01:01 <wasamasa>	I like how it has confusing = false
Oct 15 20:01:09 <wasamasa>	trololol
Oct 15 20:01:13 <pjb>	laertus: nope, not scheme.
Oct 15 20:01:20 <wasamasa>	maybe some specific schemes do
Oct 15 20:01:29 <laertus>	chicken probably does :P
Oct 15 20:01:37 <laertus>	maybe guile too
Oct 15 20:02:03 <edgar-rft>	laertus: a great opportunity to start another round of the famous "why doesn't Emacs use Common Lisp by default" flamewar :-)
Oct 15 20:02:04 <laertus>	anyway, there has to be a better reason for not moving forward with a feature than "RMS doesn't like it"
Oct 15 20:02:27 <johnw>	well, sometimes that IS the reason
Oct 15 20:02:28 <wasamasa>	CHICKEN has extensions for reader macros, but printing?
Oct 15 20:02:38 <laertus>	i don't want to make elisp in to common lisp... but i don't see why supporting useful features should be outlawed just because cl has them
Oct 15 20:02:46 <wasamasa>	might as well be "RMS doesn't see a priority there"
Oct 15 20:02:48 <pjb>	laertus: well, there is. The weight of third party emacs lisp packages.
Oct 15 20:02:50 <johnw>	what has been outlawed because CL has it?
Oct 15 20:03:30 <laertus>	pjb: how would third party emacs lisp packages be affected by having an extra feature in elisp?  they don't have to use that feature or even be aware of it
Oct 15 20:03:48 <edgar-rft>	laertus: most often the reason is just simply that it requires a huge amount of work to rewrite the Emacs internals to support a specific feature
Oct 15 20:03:49 <pjb>	laertus: even if we rewrote emacs in CL (it has been done, several times), you still have to provide an emacs lisp in CL (it has been done too), to be able to run third party packages, and you have to implement the whole emacs lisp library too with this emacs lisp API.
Oct 15 20:04:03 <pjb>	laertus: see hemlock.
Oct 15 20:04:22 <laertus>	again, i'm not proposing that emacs be written in cl, nor that elisp be turned in to cl
Oct 15 20:04:27 <laertus>	in fact, i don't want either of those
Oct 15 20:04:37 <laertus>	(i'd much prefer scheme.. but that's another rant)
Oct 15 20:04:38 <bremner>	did I mention abuse from greybeards?
Oct 15 20:04:58 <wasamasa>	actually, yes, I forgot CHICKEN offers custom record printers
Oct 15 20:05:03 <wasamasa>	which is used by the coops egg
Oct 15 20:05:10 <laertus>	there you go
Oct 15 20:05:15 <laertus>	rewrite emacs in chicken!  :)
Oct 15 20:05:19 <wasamasa>	plzno
Oct 15 20:05:25 <pjb>	laertus: that said, I'd bet that if you provided a good patch there are chances it'd be accepted.
Oct 15 20:05:27 <wasamasa>	its interactive development story is terrible
Oct 15 20:05:38 <wasamasa>	you're confined to the super slow interpreter
Oct 15 20:06:03 <laertus>	guile, then
Oct 15 20:06:05 <wasamasa>	so, that being said, I could see the existence of record types in emacs to allow for that feature to happen
Oct 15 20:06:14 <johnw>	what has been outlawed because CL has it?
Oct 15 20:07:27 <laertus>	outlawed is too strong a word
Oct 15 20:07:58 <laertus>	but i've heard again and again about something being frowned upon in emacs because of RMS' dislike for CL
Oct 15 20:08:06 <edgar-rft>	laertus: ask on emacs-devel to get a huge amount of even stronger words :-)
Oct 15 20:08:37 <wasamasa>	I know of a few people that use CHICKEN for interactive hacking, but the intended mode of operation is batch compilation really and it's pretty nice for that (though compilation speed is terrible)
Oct 15 20:08:48 <wasamasa>	unless you use tcc
Oct 15 20:09:16 <wasamasa>	guile has a better interactive development story, though the bugs people report on #scheme are terrifying
Oct 15 20:09:34 <wasamasa>	racket would be another obvious one, weren't it for their dismissal of repl-driven development
Oct 15 20:09:48 <wasamasa>	for other candidates, look at geiser I guess
Oct 15 20:10:02 <edgar-rft>	laertus: the cl-lib part of emacs is relatively new and it takes some time to convince the core devs to implement new features
Oct 15 20:10:38 <wasamasa>	ah, I forgot about mit-scheme
Oct 15 20:10:48 <wasamasa>	and chez is supported as well
Oct 15 20:11:21 <edgar-rft>	go ask on #lisp why they don't rewrite Common Lisp in Scheme
Oct 15 20:11:31 <wasamasa>	lol
Oct 15 20:11:44 <wasamasa>	there's this one guy from there implementing scheme in CL though
Oct 15 20:12:02 <ksynwa>	which one's older of the two?
Oct 15 20:12:36 <wasamasa>	I've reread The Pervert's Guide To Computer Programming and it claims at some point scheme happened when lisp had a hysterical moment
Oct 15 20:12:42 <laertus>	the thing is that elisp is widely acknowledge to be really slow compared to cl and modern schemes
Oct 15 20:12:53 <laertus>	unlike cl vs scheme
Oct 15 20:12:55 <edgar-rft>	ksynwa: both are nearly equally old but the ancestors of Common Lisp are older
Oct 15 20:13:07 <ksynwa>	thanks!
Oct 15 20:13:45 <wasamasa>	you'll want to patch print_vectorlike if at all
Oct 15 20:13:50 <jlf>	even if elisp were objectively slower than cl/scheme, what difference would it make?
Oct 15 20:13:53 <laertus>	lisp dates from the 50's (1950, iirc).. scheme from the 70's (1970 maybe)
Oct 15 20:14:15 <wasamasa>	and for the record case you'd somehow need the custom print function associated with the record object
Oct 15 20:14:43 <laertus>	jlf: ever tried looking at a syntax-highlighted long line in emacs?
Oct 15 20:14:54 <tromey>	that's not an elisp problem
Oct 15 20:14:58 <wasamasa>	that's not the fault of a single thing
Oct 15 20:15:10 <tromey>	well at least the ordinary long-line problems aren't elisp
Oct 15 20:15:24 <wasamasa>	some are intensified by it, yes
Oct 15 20:15:28 <tromey>	oh?
Oct 15 20:15:30 <laertus>	also, stuff like single-threaded emacs, vs multithreding in cl and scheme
Oct 15 20:15:37 <wasamasa>	like if you have suboptimal font lock
Oct 15 20:16:33 <laertus>	there was a good post somewhere on the advantages running elisp on guile would bring to emacs
Oct 15 20:17:04 <laertus>	long list of stuff that, on the face of it, seemed like it'd be pretty nice to have
Oct 15 20:17:37 <laertus>	even apart from the niceness of being able to script emacs in guile if you wanted (though elisp would still be fully compatible)
Oct 15 20:18:26 <laertus>	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-04/msg00665.html
Oct 15 20:18:50 <bremner>	observe the date. Observe we still don't have a pony.
Oct 15 20:19:06 <bremner>	epony doesn't count.
Oct 15 20:19:18 <laertus>	the task was either too big for him, or he just lost interest and moved on to something else
Oct 15 20:19:31 <laertus>	he seems to have gotten most of the way there, though.. which is pretty impressive for a one-man effort
Oct 15 20:19:48 <laertus>	the potential benefits are still there, though, if someone picks up the torch
Oct 15 20:19:50 <bremner>	the fact that it stayed a one-man effort is a problem
Oct 15 20:19:56 <laertus>	agreed
Oct 15 20:20:05 <terpri>	i'm right here (also, "they/them" preferred)
Oct 15 20:20:21 <bremner>	ok, one-person effort
Oct 15 20:20:29 <laertus>	sorry.. i'll let you do the speaking, then :)
Oct 15 20:20:49 <terpri>	it isn't coincidental that progress stopped after funding stopped; and for a while i had to put my full focus on adding BigInt to JS
Oct 15 20:21:26 <laertus>	so you were being funded?
Oct 15 20:21:42 <pjb>	I've never had any slowness problem with emacs…
Oct 15 20:21:51 <laertus>	lucky...
Oct 15 20:21:55 <terpri>	currently i'm trying to cobble together a few smallish contracts that will pay a living wage while still leaving time for free software development (without burnout from just working 24/7)
Oct 15 20:22:03 <wasamasa>	I guess pjb never tried helm
Oct 15 20:22:13 <laertus>	pjb: i've had emacs freeze a lot.. granted, i do have about 260 packages installed..  but still..
Oct 15 20:22:21 <edgar-rft>	we were used that emacs is slow, so we don't see it as a problem
Oct 15 20:22:34 <laertus>	terpri: can funding maybe be acquired through a kickstarter?
Oct 15 20:22:40 <jlf>	that sounds more like "helm is slow" than "emacs is slow"
Oct 15 20:23:22 <terpri>	laertus, yes, guile-emacs was funded for 5 summers by google summer of code, and for a few months it was a part-time project at igalia for a month or two before JS BigInt ended up requiring my full attention
Oct 15 20:23:26 <jlf>	though the assembly port of helm will doubtless improve matters
Oct 15 20:24:34 <terpri>	laertus, i've considered doing a patreon/liberapay, yeah. some people have expressed interest in donating
Oct 15 20:25:25 <condy>	semantic.el can be dropped since we have lsp-mode, right?
Oct 15 20:25:45 <condy>	or tags based 
Oct 15 20:26:00 <tromey>	probably should be since afaik no one maintains or uses it
Oct 15 20:26:03 <laertus>	terpri: i see people regularly asking about guile emacs in most emacs meetups i've been to, and on forums, etc.. so there's definitely interest in it.. maybe it'd translate in to funding, if a crowdfunding effort was undertaken
Oct 15 20:26:03 <tromey>	sad to say
Oct 15 20:26:44 <condy>	:'(
Oct 15 20:26:49 <laertus>	terpri: if you had the funding, do you think guile emacs could be brought in to a state where it'd be appealing for emacs users?  (ie. be fully elisp-compatible with acceptable performance)
Oct 15 20:28:13 <mplsCorwin>	how does gccemacs affect the road-map for guile emacs?
Oct 15 20:28:17 <terpri>	laertus, i believe so, especially now that guile has a decent jit
Oct 15 20:28:23 <laertus>	i've heard that guile performance has improved a lot recently, so i expect it'd do a lot better now than it did back when the original guile emacs project was alive
Oct 15 20:28:39 <terpri>	mplsCorwin, they're completely independent right now
Oct 15 20:29:17 <mplsCorwin>	Thanks.  Does this mean there is not a roadmap for jit based native comp for guile emacs?
Oct 15 20:29:45 <wasamasa>	you pick one or the other
Oct 15 20:29:56 <wasamasa>	and I'm afraid gccemacs is preferred
Oct 15 20:30:06 <mplsCorwin>	I'm just curious here.  I have no stake at all.  Hoping my tone is neutral..
Oct 15 20:32:14 <laertus>	wasamasa: why is it preferred?  surely emacs core developers wouldn't prefer to maintain more C instead of scheme?
Oct 15 20:32:19 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: that seems unfortunate but sort of what I'd expect.  I have to assume any other approach would involve very aggressively upstreaming changes to guile jit as that seems to be what's happening with Emacs and GCC.  And trying to keep all of that at feature parity sounds *really* hard.
Oct 15 20:32:54 <wasamasa>	laertus: it landed in a feature branch and can be built and experimented with, plus there's regular communication from the author with emacs-devel, so far everything looks good
Oct 15 20:33:13 <mplsCorwin>	And a good docker image to play with, as well!
Oct 15 20:33:32 <laertus>	hmm.. well, i guess those are good reasons :)
Oct 15 20:33:59 <laertus>	but if guile emacs was as available, they wouldn't turn their nose up on it just because it was built on scheme, would they?
Oct 15 20:34:03 <wasamasa>	the gravest concern for guilemacs is whether guile as a scheme can shoulder the demands of emacs
Oct 15 20:34:15 <tromey>	I don't think gccemacs is fantastic, but it's probably better than the guile approach
Oct 15 20:34:28 <laertus>	better how?
Oct 15 20:34:29 <npostavs>	"surely emacs core developers wouldn't prefer" - it's not like the core developers can tell other people what to implement
Oct 15 20:34:33 <terpri>	i'm a guile contributor as well and wingo was on my team at work for years. guile changes can happen if necessary (some emacs-specific accomodations might be required if, e.g., my implementation of buffer local variables in terms of delimited continuations doesn't work out for whatever reason)
Oct 15 20:35:02 <terpri>	buffer-local variables and strings (emacs isn't "limited" to unicode) are actually the two big question marks
Oct 15 20:35:23 <wasamasa>	terpri: perhaps you can give me an explanation why code like (fboundp 'bogus) is super slow
Oct 15 20:36:24 <terpri>	and the C-lisp interface makes some optimizations difficult, for which the ideal solution is probably getting rid of the C :)
Oct 15 20:36:38 <wasamasa>	also, https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=41404
Oct 15 20:36:48 <mplsCorwin>	terpri: thanks for the chat!
Oct 15 20:37:18 <laertus>	terpri: oh, i thought for a second you wre wingo... i guess i am confused/misinformed about who did the work on guile emacs.. could you talk about what roles both of you played in the project?
Oct 15 20:37:46 <wasamasa>	see also https://emacsninja.com/posts/state-of-emacs-lisp-on-guile.html with the "benchmarks"
Oct 15 20:39:44 <laertus>	there was also some issue about nil vs false in guile vs elisp
Oct 15 20:39:57 <terpri>	the benchmarks are terrible because compatibility was a much higher priority than performance (not to say there are zero bugs with compatibility)
Oct 15 20:40:41 <wasamasa>	compatibility is one thing, but really, six minutes to test nine thousand functions/variables?
Oct 15 20:40:58 <terpri>	i did some ad hoc benchmarks (timing gabriel benchmarks etc.) but essentially had no time to analyze them
Oct 15 20:41:15 <wasamasa>	is there some funny implementation of lisp-2 semantics?
Oct 15 20:43:30 <tromey>	doesn't there have to be
Oct 15 20:43:35 <terpri>	wasamasa, i suspect that the actual problem is, in the that the main branch, guile-emacs was still doing something like using the FFI to call emacs's C variable-value function, due to not being able to capture delimited continuations including FFI calls
Oct 15 20:43:50 <xristos>	does guile even run on windows?
Oct 15 20:43:53 <terpri>	just a guess from memory
Oct 15 20:43:55 <terpri>	xristos, yes
Oct 15 20:43:59 <xristos>	i don't see any binary downloads on its website
Oct 15 20:44:08 <terpri>	via mingw, i think
Oct 15 20:45:39 <laertus>	and maybe via WSL?
Oct 15 20:45:40 <wasamasa>	these benchmarks were about guile though, not guilemacs
Oct 15 20:45:58 <wasamasa>	so no emacs functions to reuse
Oct 15 20:46:00 <terpri>	laertus, i was the primary author of guile-emacs; wingo mentored me for three GSoCs and civodul (Ludovic Courtès, guix and guile maintainer) for one summer
Oct 15 20:46:22 <laertus>	oh, i see... good to know, thanks
Oct 15 20:46:48 <aidalgol>	grym: Were you the one who worked on CNNs at moco for a while?
Oct 15 20:47:13 <laertus>	wasamasa: when did you do those benchmarks on guile which you found to be slow?  guile's performance has supposedly gotten way, way better over the last few years
Oct 15 20:47:47 <laertus>	and from wingo's talks, i'm hearing that he's optimistic that it'll get much better still
Oct 15 20:48:17 <terpri>	wasamasa is talking about guile-elisp performance specifically, which is a separate front-end (but compiles to the same intermediate language, so benefits from JIT etc.)
Oct 15 20:48:39 <laertus>	terpri: wasamasa just said "these benchmarks were about guile though, not guilemacs"
Oct 15 20:48:44 <wasamasa>	guile 2.2.6 took 77s, guile 3.0.2 took 10 minutes
Oct 15 20:49:09 <laertus>	ouch
Oct 15 20:49:10 <wasamasa>	stable versions because compiling guile takes its sweet time
Oct 15 20:49:27 <terpri>	right, but elisp is supported as a language within guile (you can type ",L elisp" at the repl to get a very, very primitive elisp environment outside of emacs)
Oct 15 20:49:41 <wasamasa>	yeah and I documented the feature set of that environment
Oct 15 20:49:45 <sam_>	yeah, it gained JIT
Oct 15 20:50:21 <wasamasa>	last time I compiled guile 3 from source it did this bootstrapping thing and like, 2 hours for itself and 1.5 hours for guilemacs
Oct 15 20:50:28 <wasamasa>	still faster than llvm
Oct 15 20:50:47 <laertus>	rust is super slow at compiling itself too
Oct 15 20:50:51 <laertus>	gcc is bad too
Oct 15 20:51:02 <tromey>	gcc does a 3-stage bootstrap though
Oct 15 20:51:07 <aidalgol>	I mean... aren't they pretty massive?
Oct 15 20:51:09 <wasamasa>	yes indeed
Oct 15 20:51:11 <tromey>	also massive
Oct 15 20:51:15 <terpri>	wasamasa, correction if you're emacsninja: i was maintainer for five GSoCs
Oct 15 20:51:17 <wasamasa>	and gcc takes less memory than llvm
Oct 15 20:51:19 <laertus>	doesn't guile also do a multi-stage bootstrap?
Oct 15 20:51:20 <aidalgol>	Then again, building Racket doesn't take that long.
Oct 15 20:51:21 <tromey>	I heard gccemacs is slow to build, haven't tried it myself
Oct 15 20:51:24 <aidalgol>	Or... wait, yes, it can.
Oct 15 20:51:35 <wasamasa>	terpri: oh, sorry
Oct 15 20:51:39 <aidalgol>	I was thinking of when I download the bundle with prebuilt bytecode.
Oct 15 20:51:41 <grym>	aidalgol: no.  i do AI wankery these days, though 
Oct 15 20:51:43 <laertus>	did something change in guile, then, that made it perform worse on interpreting elisp?
Oct 15 20:51:47 <wasamasa>	terpri: I found two when I searched the archives
Oct 15 20:52:05 <terpri>	wasamasa, and ludo also mentored me for one summer
Oct 15 20:52:21 <aidalgol>	I wonder how long the new CZ-based Racket takes to build.
Oct 15 20:52:26 <wasamasa>	laertus: the bootstrapping thing is more elegant, but worsens performance
Oct 15 20:53:15 <terpri>	(i was briefly paid to hack on guile-emacs part time at a for-profit company, but for *some* reason, hacking on web browsers and JS engines are more profitable...)
Oct 15 20:53:33 <terpri>	is*
Oct 15 20:53:43 <aidalgol>	grym: Good enough. :p  Have you any idea how hard it would be to make a free version of those image-background-removal things?  e.g. https://remove.bg/
Oct 15 20:53:44 <wasamasa>	the idea is that bootstrapping allows for easier maintenance so that you eventually get back to acceptable performance
Oct 15 20:53:56 <wasamasa>	racket should be a good proof of that
Oct 15 20:54:07 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: how so?
Oct 15 20:54:22 <wasamasa>	I remember a blogpost about benchmarks comparing the original and chez version
Oct 15 20:55:38 <wgreenhouse>	wait, so racket is now a scheme that needs to be bootstrapped from another scheme?
Oct 15 20:55:45 <aidalgol>	I remember a blog post about Agenda 21 is going to enslave us all.
Oct 15 20:55:48 <wgreenhouse>	like the bigger CL implementations?
Oct 15 20:56:04 <technomancy>	wgreenhouse: I think that's accurate
Oct 15 20:56:11 <wgreenhouse>	interesting.
Oct 15 20:56:14 <wgreenhouse>	are there other schemes in that category?
Oct 15 20:56:21 <grym>	aidalgol: the term of art for that is 'image segmentation'.  there are some classical techniques that are hit or miss 
Oct 15 20:56:29 <aidalgol>	wgreenhouse: Original announcement: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/racket-dev/2BV3ElyfF8Y/4RSd3XbECAAJ
Oct 15 20:56:31 <wgreenhouse>	("SBCL-like" second generation implementations that get bootstrapped from something else)
Oct 15 20:56:37 <aidalgol>	grym: ah, good to know.
Oct 15 20:57:42 <grym>	aidalgol: openCV has a 'watershed' or 'grabcut' tool.  you select a few landmarks and then it's some reasonably clever thresholding/edge detection 
Oct 15 20:57:42 <terpri>	ok, let's take a straw poll. assuming i cut back hours at $work enough to productively work on guile-emacs again, how many people here would kick in $10/mo or more towards guile-emacs development? (potential donators can privmsg if they'd prefer) the goals would be:
Oct 15 20:58:10 <grym>	aidalgol: expect things like a splayed-hand to be tricky, but big blobby stuff like cars to be OK 
Oct 15 20:58:39 <laertus>	wasamasa: i just tried your benchmarks on guile 3.0.4, but got some exceptions...  https://dpaste.com/BDG98RSQS   i'm guessing that i need to recompile guile with elisp support or something...
Oct 15 20:58:47 <terpri>	(1) rebase both the emacs changes and the guile changes, with more of a focus on upstreaming changes than before so it's not a continuous chore
Oct 15 20:59:23 <terpri>	(2) investigate performance problems and optimize guile-emacs so that it is at least as performant in everyday use as vanilla gnu emacs
Oct 15 20:59:51 <wasamasa>	hm, 10$
Oct 15 21:00:01 <wasamasa>	the most I pay on patreon is 5$ for several creators
Oct 15 21:00:04 <xristos>	terpri: i think you should first try and ascertain that your efforts will not be wasted
Oct 15 21:00:08 <wasamasa>	yes, that
Oct 15 21:00:09 <grym>	aidalgol: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d8/d83/tutorial_py_grabcut.html is some less-shitty-than-normal docs on this by openCV standards
Oct 15 21:00:18 <laertus>	terpri: i'd do it.. but i'm probably a bigger scheme fan than most emacs users...
Oct 15 21:00:32 <xristos>	terpri: and i doubt you'd manage that
Oct 15 21:00:56 <xristos>	guile has few users, which means fuzzy implications/uncertainty
Oct 15 21:01:17 <grym>	aidalgol: thankfully they ship wheels now, too 
Oct 15 21:01:24 <xristos>	a win is hard to see in any reasonable cost-benefit analysis
Oct 15 21:01:32 <terpri>	(3) research possible cooperation with other projects like gccemacs and remacs (though i don't think that's likely)
Oct 15 21:02:19 <wasamasa>	blog post updated
Oct 15 21:02:47 <laertus>	xristos: did you read this?  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2010-04/msg00665.html
Oct 15 21:03:28 <laertus>	there seem to be lots of wins in guile hosting elisp, from where i'm standing
Oct 15 21:03:33 <terpri>	xristos, previous emacs maintainers have been skeptical but open to the idea of guile integration, if its various problems can be solved (and they can, imo, it's a question of time and labor and cooperation; it's not an unachievable goal)
Oct 15 21:04:04 <xristos>	laertus: that was 10 years go, none of the promises of guilemacs materialized
Oct 15 21:04:15 <xristos>	on the other hand, Emacs has managed to move significantly forward
Oct 15 21:04:28 <xristos>	so if folks were skeptical then, i don't see them being less skeptical now
Oct 15 21:04:48 <laertus>	well, the interest in my personal experience has been significant.. people ask about guile emacs all the time
Oct 15 21:05:12 <xristos>	very generic statement, from what i observe it's mostly randoms on reddit
Oct 15 21:05:16 <xristos>	that have a totally skewed perspective on things
Oct 15 21:05:21 <xristos>	and/or wild expectations
Oct 15 21:05:23 <laertus>	i've heard it discussed at emacs meetups as well
Oct 15 21:05:30 <laertus>	and on this channel many times
Oct 15 21:05:46 <laertus>	and reddit is not exactly an insignificant forum any more
Oct 15 21:05:54 <xristos>	let's do it because a bunch of misinformed randoms ask for it doesn't strike me as proper argumentation
Oct 15 21:06:11 <laertus>	well, those "misiniformed randoms" might actually provide funding
Oct 15 21:06:24 <laertus>	whereas the more informed gurus stand aside and watch
Oct 15 21:06:34 <xristos>	you can provide all the funding you want to make a pig fly, but that doesn't seem like a good idea
Oct 15 21:06:51 <laertus>	i've yet to hear a good argument against guile emacs
Oct 15 21:06:55 <xristos>	better to examine your foundations and make sure you're not building on sand
Oct 15 21:07:15 <laertus>	the best i've heard is that some people would prefer to base emacs on CL or rust
Oct 15 21:08:02 <terpri>	the key remaining advantage for guile-emacs (and possibly gccemacs) is that it will be possible to replace a large portion of C code with elisp. some of the other benefits are still valid too (emacs has bignums but not bigrats, for example -- and implementing JS BigInt forced me to become something of an expert on numeric towers)
Oct 15 21:08:20 <laertus>	what about multithreading?
Oct 15 21:08:33 <xristos>	16:05 <xristos> that have a totally skewed perspective on things
Oct 15 21:08:45 <xristos>	that's multithreading
Oct 15 21:09:35 <jrm>	wasamasa: Fyi, on https://depp.brause.cc/eyebrowse/ the link to https://github.com/emacsmirror/escreen gives a 404.
Oct 15 21:09:55 <wasamasa>	regrettable
Oct 15 21:10:02 <wasamasa>	you'd think an emacsmirror keeps things up
Oct 15 21:10:02 <aidalgol>	grym: Oh, so these things aren't even using neural networks?
Oct 15 21:10:19 <jrm>	It's Github page.
Oct 15 21:10:24 <laertus>	"replacing a large portion of C code with elisp" could be huge, as, as has been mentioned on here many times, emacs' legacy C code is one of the main impediments to emacs moving forward
Oct 15 21:10:29 <jrm>	Oh, yes.  emacsmirror github account.
Oct 15 21:10:34 <terpri>	emacs has multithreading now, albeit "mostly cooperative"
Oct 15 21:10:37 <tromey>	the basic argument against guile is that there is a semantic mismatch that's hard to overcome
Oct 15 21:10:50 <wasamasa>	jrm: I guess it's https://github.com/emacsattic/escreen now
Oct 15 21:10:54 <terpri>	guile also has multithreading, of course
Oct 15 21:10:57 <tromey>	so why bother trying, do something better in situ
Oct 15 21:11:08 <tromey>	many of the claimed benefits are illusory at best
Oct 15 21:11:10 <wasamasa>	terpri: sure, but that will need to be integrated with the existing thread support or crash horribly
Oct 15 21:11:24 <terpri>	yes
Oct 15 21:11:25 <tromey>	they rely on not engaging in actually trying, to make them sound possible
Oct 15 21:11:28 <jrm>	I'm giving eyebrowse a go, but I don't think I'm smart enough to figure out how window configurations are generated or saved.
Oct 15 21:11:34 <grym>	aidalgol: they very likely aren't. 
Oct 15 21:11:47 <aidalgol>	grym: SCAM!!
Oct 15 21:11:47 <wasamasa>	jrm: it takes whatever is the current one and stores it in a frame parameter
Oct 15 21:11:57 <wasamasa>	jrm: then when you switch to another one it restores whatever used to be there
Oct 15 21:12:05 <wasamasa>	jrm: much like virtual desktops work
Oct 15 21:12:05 <grym>	aidalgol: you can use a segmentation network if you like, but you'd want either representative pretrained state or some training data of your own 
Oct 15 21:12:38 <wgreenhouse>	laertus: replacing C code with something alleged to be more maintainable is what remacs, gccemacs, and guile-emacs all suppose they're trying to do--in remacs's case it's about porting the C core to bug-compatible rust
Oct 15 21:12:45 <xristos>	laertus: replacing a large portion of C code with XXX was one of the reasons behind remacs, they plucked some of the low-hanging fruit and now seem to have reached a deadend
Oct 15 21:12:52 <laertus>	jrm: just do: (eyebrowse-switch-to-window-config-0)  or (eyebrowse-switch-to-window-config-1) etc.. simple
Oct 15 21:12:56 <wasamasa>	xristos: hm, is that so
Oct 15 21:13:04 <aidalgol>	grym: wat?
Oct 15 21:13:21 <wasamasa>	jrm: fixed the link
Oct 15 21:13:35 <edgar-rft>	we don't want to lose our long-beloved bugs
Oct 15 21:13:45 <laertus>	wgreenhouse and xristos: great.. i'm not begrudging remacs trying this road too.. it's not an argument against guile emacs
Oct 15 21:13:48 <cvandusen>	rudybot: hugabug 
Oct 15 21:13:48 <rudybot>	cvandusen: eh?  Try "rudybot: help".
Oct 15 21:13:56 <grym>	aidalgol: you could use a neural network to do this.  you would probably not want to start from scratch, and you'd want to update the pretrained neural network with some of your own data that is representative of the scenarios you'd want to do background subtraction in 
Oct 15 21:14:32 <grym>	aidalgol: your performance with a NN will be more generalizable to novel backgrounds than classical techniques without human interaction 
Oct 15 21:14:48 <tromey>	is gccemacs really looking at replacing the c core?
Oct 15 21:14:49 <aidalgol>	grym: So a neural net would only *possibly* help improve results in special cases?
Oct 15 21:14:51 <tromey>	I mean, I hope so
Oct 15 21:14:56 <laertus>	xristos: and just because remacs ran in to some blocking issues doesn't mean that guile will run in to them too.. they are after all radically different langauges with different incompatibilities with emacs/elisp
Oct 15 21:15:01 <tromey>	but afaik it was mostly focused on speeding up elisp
Oct 15 21:15:15 <terpri>	that was my impression, too
Oct 15 21:15:29 <tromey>	remacs actually has a simpler job than guile emacs
Oct 15 21:15:31 <grym>	aidalgol: it'll get you pretty good or better across lots of scenarios without user tweaking at crop time.
Oct 15 21:15:52 <terpri>	whereas my long-term goal for guile-emacs is to make emacs more like a lisp machine (which, yes, i have used extensively in emulation)
Oct 15 21:15:59 <tromey>	because in remacs they aren't concerned about unifying 2 disparate runtimes
Oct 15 21:16:06 <edgar-rft>	let's rewrite Guile in Common Lisp and then implement Emacs in it
Oct 15 21:16:35 <technomancy>	not until we finish rewriting CL in Forth
Oct 15 21:16:46 <terpri>	it's more likely that guile will gain a CL frontend based on the elisp frontend than be rewritten in CL. though you never know
Oct 15 21:17:10 <grym>	aidalgol: the usual approach for image segmentation, either NN based or classical computer vision based, is to  use your automatic segmentation techniques to get you a mask on the image, and then have the ability to tweak that mask by human intervention when you have to (and hopefully not very often, if you want to do batch processing)
Oct 15 21:17:34 <aidalgol>	grym: right.  that sounds saner than "rub a NN on it!"
Oct 15 21:17:50 <terpri>	(i've actually started a side project for that, which might be made easier by beach's SICL though i haven't evaluated it thoroughly)
Oct 15 21:18:02 <aidalgol>	technomancy: I have resolved to only use fedi for shitposting
Oct 15 21:18:22 <grym>	aidalgol: yep.  they're not _that_ magical 
Oct 15 21:18:49 <terpri>	(and guile has something very much like CLOS -- GOOPS -- which makes it simpler)
Oct 15 21:19:13 <laertus>	how does goops compare to eieio (or whatever it's called) ?
Oct 15 21:19:36 <aidalgol>	laertus: It's actually sane.)
Oct 15 21:20:12 <terpri>	^
Oct 15 21:20:13 <technomancy>	GOOPS vs CLOS: https://p.hagelb.org/jeff.jpg
Oct 15 21:20:26 <technomancy>	"What's the difference? They're both OOP."
Oct 15 21:20:34 <grym>	boop
Oct 15 21:20:53 <wgreenhouse>	laertus: I'm not saying the existence of remacs is an argument against or for guile-emacs, I'm just noting that there at least 3 attempts to "replace the C core"
Oct 15 21:21:00 <terpri>	technomancy, i'm stealing that meme ;)
Oct 15 21:21:04 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Thing is, GOOPS methods aren't *in* the objects, so it feels less like OO than... OO.
Oct 15 21:21:12 <technomancy>	terpri: it's an top-notch grimace
Oct 15 21:21:22 <laertus>	wgreenhouse: but we have to remember that gnu emacs is itself not the original emacs
Oct 15 21:21:30 <bandali>	technomancy, that meme is *awesome* :-D
Oct 15 21:21:38 <wgreenhouse>	laertus: why is that relevant
Oct 15 21:21:40 <technomancy>	bandali: the original was Marvel vs DC
Oct 15 21:21:40 <bandali>	ha!
Oct 15 21:21:40 <tromey>	wgreenhouse: has there been movement on using gccemacs to replace c code?
Oct 15 21:21:49 <tromey>	I haven't been following e-d
Oct 15 21:21:51 <aidalgol>	technomancy: What was his answer?  "They're both comics?"
Oct 15 21:21:53 <laertus>	because some efforts to significantly improve/change emacs fail, while others succeed
Oct 15 21:21:54 <technomancy>	aidalgol: yeah
Oct 15 21:22:00 <technomancy>	ironically he got a part in a Marvel film later on
Oct 15 21:22:05 <laertus>	it's not like the multiple failures of others destines guile emacs to failure
Oct 15 21:22:08 <bandali>	lol
Oct 15 21:22:08 <grym>	a _good_ part
Oct 15 21:22:41 <aidalgol>	technomancy: of course he did...
Oct 15 21:22:43 <wgreenhouse>	tromey: part of the implicit attraction of gccemacs is e.g. that ansi-term compiled to .eln has similar performance to vterm which is a C module
Oct 15 21:22:48 <terpri>	i'm following e-d, only 10,004 messages behind
Oct 15 21:22:51 <wgreenhouse>	with all the build-time annoyances that entails
Oct 15 21:23:12 <tromey>	my dream is to replace the c with elisp
Oct 15 21:23:24 <technomancy>	all C
Oct 15 21:23:24 <tromey>	I don't think gccemacs is a great approach but maybe it's an ok stepping stone
Oct 15 21:23:27 <technomancy>	in every program
Oct 15 21:23:29 <grym>	https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/the-grandmaster-jeff-goldblum.jpg?w=650
Oct 15 21:23:33 <technomancy>	no code is safe
Oct 15 21:23:35 <jrm>	wasamasa: 1. Start with desired window configuration. 2. `eyebrowse-create-window-config' 3. `eyebrowse-rename-window-config' to give the current configuration a name (Review in my case) 4. Switch to displaying a single scratch buffer and I see [1, 2:Review] in the mode-line.  5. `eyebrowse-switch-to-window-config' and choose Review, but it stays at the *scratch* buffer.  That is intended?
Oct 15 21:23:41 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Except yours?
Oct 15 21:23:56 <technomancy>	aidalgol: I actually wrote some C code once
Oct 15 21:24:00 <technomancy>	for my forth implementation
Oct 15 21:24:05 <technomancy>	if tromey rewrites it in elisp I won't complain
Oct 15 21:24:16 <wgreenhouse>	:D
Oct 15 21:24:22 <tromey>	:)
Oct 15 21:24:27 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Until the revolution comes, we're stuck writing C from time to time.
Oct 15 21:24:45 <technomancy>	speak for yourself
Oct 15 21:24:51 <technomancy>	I saw the error of my ways
Oct 15 21:24:56 <aidalgol>	By "we", I mean "we the workers".
Oct 15 21:24:59 <wasamasa>	jrm: cannot reproduce that
Oct 15 21:25:04 <aidalgol>	Let's apply "left twitter" catchphrases to programming.
Oct 15 21:25:15 *	aidalgol ponders how to shoehorn "mask off" into programming discourse...
Oct 15 21:25:25 <wasamasa>	jrm: you'll have to be a bit more detailed
Oct 15 21:25:26 <technomancy>	aidalgol: you have nothing to lose but your segfaults!
Oct 15 21:25:31 <wasamasa>	jrm: like keypresses detail
Oct 15 21:25:35 <grym>	i have written about 10 lines of C in my life 
Oct 15 21:25:41 <grym>	like, ever 
Oct 15 21:26:07 <laertus>	i used to write a fair bit of C back when i was interested in genetic programming
Oct 15 21:26:09 <aidalgol>	technomancy: I mean... *something* at *some layer* has to do the ugly work.
Oct 15 21:26:25 <technomancy>	aidalgol: but that shit's already been written
Oct 15 21:26:27 <laertus>	but that was something like 20+ years ago...
Oct 15 21:26:41 <aidalgol>	technomancy: How do you write the new stuff?  For new chips?
Oct 15 21:27:00 <technomancy>	what new chips?
Oct 15 21:27:04 <wasamasa>	jrm: the expected thing is that slot 1 has whatever windows/buffers were last displayed there and slot 2 whatever windows/buffers were last displayed there
Oct 15 21:27:07 <aidalgol>	New SoCs?
Oct 15 21:27:14 <aidalgol>	New revisions of microcontrollers.
Oct 15 21:27:22 <aidalgol>	grym, laertus: I work on a C++ codebase for a living that should really be several separate daemons written in something saner.
Oct 15 21:27:32 <aidalgol>	Fuck, even a pile of go "microservices" would be preferable
Oct 15 21:27:33 <jrm>	wasamasa: Will write a details log.
Oct 15 21:28:06 <tromey>	new chips arrive still
Oct 15 21:28:07 <tromey>	risc-v
Oct 15 21:28:13 <technomancy>	aidalgol: even if that were a problem that people in this channel had (which it's obviously not) there are better answers than "more C code"
Oct 15 21:28:41 <laertus>	i still meet big fans of C and C++ from time to time
Oct 15 21:28:57 <nly>	thanks npostavs for the advice other day
Oct 15 21:29:12 <terpri>	it's harsh to say that "none of the promises of guile-emacs materialized". i've *demonstrated* some of the promised benefits by getting guile-emacs *functionining* in 18 months (of which more like 12 were fully focused on the problems at hand, as the GSoC internships were staggered over summers and there were always a few weeks spent rebasing on both the emacs and guile sides)
Oct 15 21:29:14 <nly>	gotta love magit
Oct 15 21:29:23 <aidalgol>	technomancy: OK, I'm listening...
Oct 15 21:29:27 <nly>	oh no
Oct 15 21:29:33 <tromey>	some people really imprint on a system and have trouble changing
Oct 15 21:29:37 <nly>	talking about guile-emacs...
Oct 15 21:29:49 <tromey>	though of course I'm that way about emacs
Oct 15 21:30:16 <technomancy>	aidalgol: my point is that is so far removed from the concerns of 99.9% of software developers as to be completely irrelevant
Oct 15 21:30:41 <wasamasa>	sad
Oct 15 21:30:49 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Fair point, but are we not all in this together?
Oct 15 21:31:06 <laertus>	terpri: i think people that complain about guile emacs are looking for something they can use in place of emacs, with at least comprable performance and elisp compatibility... and most of those people today see guile emacs as an old, dead project.. fortunately there are other people still excited about its potential
Oct 15 21:31:10 <wasamasa>	one of the few options for programmers to write actually efficient code and it's only relevant for 0.01%??
Oct 15 21:31:10 <fsbot>	Inconceivable!
Oct 15 21:31:16 <wasamasa>	a shame
Oct 15 21:31:27 <aidalgol>	wasamasa is goin' fishin'!
Oct 15 21:31:51 <nly>	tax the 0.01 %
Oct 15 21:31:58 <wasamasa>	I just hate inefficient programs
Oct 15 21:32:07 <xristos>	terpri: hard to get excited about anything guile-related when it's mostly wallowing in obscurity and non-usage
Oct 15 21:32:47 <laertus>	terpri: also, i wouldn't take the lack of response from your straw poll in here as indicative of general interest in guile emacs.. with a properly publicised crowding campaign i'd expect you'd get a lot more interest
Oct 15 21:32:51 <technomancy>	wasamasa: for mandlebrot, LuaJIT emits the exact same IR that a C compiler would
Oct 15 21:33:07 <technomancy>	saying C is the only option for efficient code would be absurd
Oct 15 21:33:14 <wasamasa>	few I've said
Oct 15 21:33:34 <wasamasa>	and no, I wouldn't bet on luajit's longevity compared to C
Oct 15 21:33:44 <wasamasa>	or suitability to replace it
Oct 15 21:33:47 <terpri>	laertus, yeah, i've run across pro-guile posts in /r/emacs occasionally, so there is at least some community interest
Oct 15 21:34:03 <technomancy>	using C for application-level coding is a mistake akin to treating illness with leeches
Oct 15 21:34:20 <laertus>	terpri: if you'd been to the emacs meetups i've gone to you'd hear more interest.. people are always asking about it
Oct 15 21:34:21 <terpri>	xristos, gnu guix is doing pretty well, but other than that singular project, fair enough
Oct 15 21:34:53 <xristos>	technomancy: it pains me that gccemacs didn't go down the dynasm/minilua route
Oct 15 21:34:53 <nly>	don't forget nomad, a web browser in guile
Oct 15 21:35:01 <jrm>	wasamasa: https://ftfl.ca/paste/eyebrowse-log.html
Oct 15 21:35:28 <technomancy>	xristos: yeah I've been meaning too look more into dynasm; looks promising
Oct 15 21:35:45 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Is anyone talking about application-level programming?
Oct 15 21:35:47 <tromey>	I think vlad makarov's MIR is a promising JIT
Oct 15 21:36:08 <tromey>	it has a few interesting things and he's a super compiler hacker
Oct 15 21:36:12 <tromey>	bad choice of name tho
Oct 15 21:36:20 <technomancy>	aidalgol: not in this channel, but in general
Oct 15 21:36:25 <laertus>	terpri: the thing is, as you well know, most emacs users are not big fans of C, and everyone wishes that all of emacs could be lisp-based instead of having so much legacy code holding it back.. i think most everybody is onboard with having less C, and if guile was a practical option, i don't think there'd be a lot of resistance... quite the opposite
Oct 15 21:36:27 <tromey>	if I reboot my emacs jit I plan to use his thing
Oct 15 21:36:29 <pjb>	nly: the 0.01% don't have money in the bank. They have shares of corporations.  If you want to tax them, they'll have to sell their share. Since only the poor have money in the bank, but very little, their share selling will make the price drop, (to match demand), and very litle money will be extracted and taxed.  
Oct 15 21:36:30 <pjb>	nly: now, world richest 1% have more than 2x as much wealth as the rest.  Say we take them all they have (shares in corporations), and spread it over the 99%.  This means that if you have 100$ in the bank, you'll get 200$ worth of shares. Say 1/2 a TSLA share.  TSLA has never paid a dividend…
Oct 15 21:36:30 <pjb>	 
Oct 15 21:37:09 <pjb>	nly: so you won't be any richer. The 1% will lose control of the corporations. It will be a mess, and you will be fired, and everything will be broken.
Oct 15 21:37:28 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Right, I was just saying until we have a *full* replacement for C, we need to write stuff in C.  Maybe D is viable.  I honestly don't know.
Oct 15 21:37:39 <aidalgol>	The only D programmer I know is JordiGH, and he doesn't do embedded dev.
Oct 15 21:37:57 <wasamasa>	look at the stuff a linux desktop relies on and ask yourself, does your favorite language have the potential to replace all that?
Oct 15 21:38:00 <wasamasa>	just the packaging situation is absurd
Oct 15 21:38:07 <technomancy>	luajit is used for userspace networking in cases where the kernel is just too damn slow at routing packets http://lukego.github.io/blog/2013/01/03/snabb-switchs-luajit-ethernet-device-driver/
Oct 15 21:38:08 <nly>	pjb fair point. I concede my proposal
Oct 15 21:38:15 <JordiGH>	"Just the packaging situation"
Oct 15 21:38:20 <JordiGH>	The packaging situation is the whole problem.
Oct 15 21:38:23 <wasamasa>	what's an ABI again?
Oct 15 21:38:36 <technomancy>	wasamasa: C's build story is much worse than any other language I've used
Oct 15 21:38:40 <technomancy>	by an enormous margin
Oct 15 21:38:41 <pjb>	nly: the error you made is that you are thinking in the terms of the system: you just want to be caliph in place of the caliph. You're a mean jealous.
Oct 15 21:39:06 <wasamasa>	technomancy: likewise few things work as well inside a Makefile
Oct 15 21:39:32 <bpalmer>	(The taxation proposal is not a fair point, I will just chime in without wanting to get super-involved; among other things, companies not paying a dividend is not a permanent fact of life. If the people who own shares want, the company will issue dividends, providing cash without change in control)
Oct 15 21:39:33 <pjb>	http://www.imaveditions.com/collection/iznogoud
Oct 15 21:39:40 <nly>	pjb: Ah, sorry
Oct 15 21:39:48 <technomancy>	all the packaging work I've done has really consistent on this: everything is easy, until C is introduced, then it becomes a nightmare
Oct 15 21:40:06 <technomancy>	there are no exceptions
Oct 15 21:40:06 <aidalgol>	pjb: Avoid the personal remarks, please.
Oct 15 21:40:24 <nly>	also pjb good day sir :)
Oct 15 21:40:34 <aidalgol>	technomancy: From what I've observed, I think that is largely because of what you are trying to do.
Oct 15 21:40:52 <pjb>	It's funny how the name of the great vizir is English: Isnogoud = Is No Good :-)
Oct 15 21:40:52 <bpalmer>	I'm not sure what the 'packaging system' is.
Oct 15 21:41:10 <wasamasa>	the usual suspects, apt, pacman, ...
Oct 15 21:41:11 <technomancy>	aidalgol: you think "build executables you can distribute to end users" is a weird edge case?
Oct 15 21:41:24 <bpalmer>	One huge disadvantage in C and C++ is the lack of a single overwhelminingly popular *build* system, but once you figure out to build things, packages seem easy.
Oct 15 21:41:28 <pjb>	aidalgol: ok. All those who complain about the 1% are mean and jealous people. It's not personal, it's general!
Oct 15 21:41:39 <aidalgol>	Those "easy" ecosystems become painful when you're in systems development.
Oct 15 21:41:59 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Statically?  Yes, that's less common.
Oct 15 21:42:05 <wasamasa>	technomancy: so static linking, I see
Oct 15 21:42:36 <pjb>	technomancy: I've got an easy solution: run on a system without a C compiler! Preferably a system where the architecture makes it hard to implement C ;-)
Oct 15 21:42:52 <wasamasa>	lol
Oct 15 21:42:55 <CompanionCube>	probably rather hard, even ye olde lisp machines had a c compiler...
Oct 15 21:43:06 <CompanionCube>	maybe a FORTH machine?
Oct 15 21:43:17 <nly>	anyone here bought any power9 machine?
Oct 15 21:43:18 <pjb>	AS400?
Oct 15 21:43:44 <CompanionCube>	pjb: nothing about AS/400 makes it particularly hostile to C as a language
Oct 15 21:44:02 <bpalmer>	PDP 6 never had a c compiler, I don't believe
Oct 15 21:44:03 <pjb>	Graned, even lisp machines had a Zeta-C compiler…
Oct 15 21:44:08 <pjb>	+t
Oct 15 21:44:16 <wasamasa>	grated
Oct 15 21:44:35 <bpalmer>	However, only 23 PDP-6s were sold, so not many people will be running these programs, I guess.
Oct 15 21:44:51 <jrm>	wasamasa: I think I got it.  They are sorta like desktops in a window manager rather than save window configurations.  Makes sense now.  Sorry for the noise.
Oct 15 21:44:58 <CompanionCube>	could you implement a C compiler, though?
Oct 15 21:46:21 <johnjay>	isn't the whole point of c you can implement it everywhere?
Oct 15 21:47:19 <bpalmer>	CompanionCube: hmm. I suppose someone could, at least K&R C.
Oct 15 21:47:24 <wgreenhouse>	johnjay: the point of C is that you can write a unix in it. now you have 2 problems.
Oct 15 21:47:33 <pjb>	johnjay: turing equivalencen
Oct 15 21:47:39 <johnjay>	haha true
Oct 15 21:47:55 <johnjay>	aidalgol: i guess that makes me a scheming atheist w.r.t. computers then.
Oct 15 21:48:05 <johnjay>	until we can come up with something better let's just use scheme for everything
Oct 15 21:48:16 <wasamasa>	lol
Oct 15 21:48:17 <aidalgol>	johnjay: eh?
Oct 15 21:48:35 <johnjay>	after you said let's just use C until something better comes along
Oct 15 21:48:37 <bpalmer>	PDP-6 was a 36-bit architecture, unlike the PDP-7's 18-bit. I wonder what role that would play.
Oct 15 21:48:39 <mplsCorwin>	Let's make a new c-lang for today's computing environment.  We can call it 20cc.
Oct 15 21:48:40 <johnjay>	let's take that logic to the next level
Oct 15 21:49:02 <aidalgol>	oh
Oct 15 21:49:30 <grym>	mplsCorwin: but, do you get stickers to hand out at cons? 
Oct 15 21:49:31 <bpalmer>	mplsCorwin: C++20 has some nice things.
Oct 15 21:49:42 <mplsCorwin>	grym: if you are very brave
Oct 15 21:50:03 <grym>	mplsCorwin: https://imgur.com/cEzxFOC  it's very The Prime Thanatos ... 
Oct 15 21:50:07 <mplsCorwin>	bpalmer: *reads*
Oct 15 21:50:12 <CaffeineVaccine>	I've been stuck on this macro for 2 days... What I'm trying to do is create a macro that creates a data structure and creates an object of that datastructure right after: https://pastebin.com/AczGskm2
Oct 15 21:50:53 <wasamasa>	macrostep is your friend
Oct 15 21:51:08 <mplsCorwin>	I wonder if gensym could help here.
Oct 15 21:51:11 <bpalmer>	mplsCorwin: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20 . For example, nowadays people writing C++ can safely assume integers are in 2's complement , instead of just blindly assuming integers are in 2's complement.
Oct 15 21:51:19 <johnjay>	granted someone like wasamasa who actually does scheme on a regular basis probably has more insight
Oct 15 21:51:25 <johnjay>	i'm just a SICP-level peon
Oct 15 21:51:34 <mplsCorwin>	bpalmer: that looks better than the wikipedia article. Thanks!
Oct 15 21:51:47 <wasamasa>	even if my preferred scheme had its pain points fixed I wouldn't use it for everything
Oct 15 21:52:04 *	edgar-rft prefers megabuttkicks over macrosteps
Oct 15 21:52:07 <mplsCorwin>	grym: "Fox Force Five"
Oct 15 21:52:38 <wasamasa>	not in the browser (or other unfriendly environments), not for throwaway scripts, not in other people's projects
Oct 15 21:52:50 <wasamasa>	like, say, emacs
Oct 15 21:52:55 <johnjay>	what does unfriendly mean?
Oct 15 21:53:01 <wasamasa>	hostile
Oct 15 21:53:10 <johnjay>	oh like security? ok
Oct 15 21:53:11 <wasamasa>	think of browsers implementing exactly one runtime
Oct 15 21:53:32 <wasamasa>	or operating systems making support of anything but their blessed language hard (hello windows/mac/android)
Oct 15 21:53:40 <bpalmer>	CaffeineVaccine: backquote the progn, not progn two backquotes
Oct 15 21:54:10 <bpalmer>	CaffeineVaccine: I don't know about macrostep, but I would make heavy use of macroexpand
Oct 15 21:54:45 <wasamasa>	macrostep is interactive macroexpand preview
Oct 15 21:55:13 <bpalmer>	you'll see that your macro right now, when expanded, is just a defconst. the struct definition is discarded.
Oct 15 21:56:03 *	bpalmer has long ago fallen into printf debugging, rather than debugger debugging.
Oct 15 21:56:18 <wasamasa>	both have their use
Oct 15 21:57:03 <CaffeineVaccine>	bpalmer: It was that simple.......
Oct 15 21:57:30 <CaffeineVaccine>	bpalmer: Why in the world would it make a difference to backquote the progn instead of the two backquotes???????
Oct 15 21:57:31 <fsbot>	Improbable!
Oct 15 21:57:36 <CaffeineVaccine>	That is so unintuitive
Oct 15 21:57:40 <wasamasa>	no, it's not
Oct 15 21:57:46 <wasamasa>	the backquote part is the expansion
Oct 15 21:57:55 <wasamasa>	the non-backquote part is compile-time code
Oct 15 21:58:10 <CaffeineVaccine>	wasamasa: so I'm not understanding expansion correctly it seems??
Oct 15 21:58:10 <fsbot>	Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
Oct 15 21:58:16 <wasamasa>	your macro code has to return the generated code
Oct 15 21:58:31 <wasamasa>	(progn `(foo) `(bar)) returns `(bar)
Oct 15 21:58:41 <wasamasa>	`(progn (foo) (bar)) doesn't
Oct 15 21:58:44 <bpalmer>	CaffeineVaccine: macros are run at macroexpansion/time.  Whatever they return will be evaluated at run-time.
Oct 15 21:58:57 <bpalmer>	macroexpansion/compile time.
Oct 15 22:00:46 <bpalmer>	When you write a macro, you want to come up with a fancy shortcut to transform source code into run-time code; this means, as another step in writing a macro, just write all the complicated parts as a function
Oct 15 22:01:05 <bpalmer>	that way you can easily see what the return value is , and whether it returns code you can evaluate and does the job.
Oct 15 22:01:28 <bpalmer>	Then do just enough patching to turn it into a macro (e.g., adding quotes & backquotes , changing defun to defmacro)
Oct 15 22:01:44 <terpri>	laertus, all fair points, and it's encouraging to hear that there's still interest from the rank-and-file after such a long hibernation
Oct 15 22:01:51 <bpalmer>	It's not the only way to do things, but it's the best way I've found to avoid bugs.
Oct 15 22:02:25 <terpri>	and, i just checked with my main client and will only have part-time time commitments for the next several months
Oct 15 22:02:31 <laertus>	terpri: there'll be more interest if people get wind of guile emacs possibly coming back to life
Oct 15 22:02:47 <CaffeineVaccine>	bpalmer: wasamasa: thanks but still not fully comprehending why backquoting just the progn makes the macro work
Oct 15 22:02:58 <terpri>	i've never been very good at marketing, but that's a skill that can be learned (and that others can potentially help with)
Oct 15 22:03:12 <wasamasa>	CaffeineVaccine: perhaps you need to understand evaluation first
Oct 15 22:03:27 <CaffeineVaccine>	wasamasa: that's probably true
Oct 15 22:03:48 <johnjay>	wasamasa: i noticed your front page is just plain html. you don't use any web frameworks except for the emacs blogs?
Oct 15 22:03:57 <wasamasa>	http://gigamonkeys.com/book/macros-defining-your-own.html explains macros with a fun story
Oct 15 22:04:05 <terpri>	so, i think i'm going to give it a go, and damn the torpedoes! the worst possible outcomes are inadequate funding or inadequate progress, which is no worse than the status quo
Oct 15 22:04:38 <wasamasa>	johnjay: no frameworks worth using with scheme
Oct 15 22:04:41 <wasamasa>	johnjay: if any at all
Oct 15 22:05:07 <wasamasa>	johnjay: the closest thing is called "awful" and it does live up that name indeed, found my first bug in five minutes
Oct 15 22:05:20 <laertus>	terpri: i encourage you to take a look at the successful crowdfunding campaigns... the ones i know of and paid attention to are those of magit, and andrew plotkin (beloved test-adventure, interactive fiction author).. those made their kickstarter goals pretty quickly.. i'm not sure if guile emacs will have quite that kind of success in fundraising, but you might be surprised at how many people will commit
Oct 15 22:05:20 <johnjay>	hah
Oct 15 22:05:22 <laertus>	money if someone who's shown proven results in a project they care about asks for help
Oct 15 22:05:57 <johnjay>	laertus: how long do you have to work on it to prove you care about it though
Oct 15 22:06:00 <johnjay>	5 year plan?
Oct 15 22:06:43 <laertus>	i don't think people are looking for proof of caring about it
Oct 15 22:07:14 <CaffeineVaccine>	Thanks guys
Oct 15 22:07:18 <sam_>	as someone who would chip in
Oct 15 22:07:27 <laertus>	just proof you've done well at something they care about and therefore be likely of achieving more if properly funded
Oct 15 22:07:35 <sam_>	just provide status updates when you can, be realistic about what you can achieve, and give links/proof that you can do the job
Oct 15 22:07:42 <sam_>	yep
Oct 15 22:08:02 <sam_>	terpri: please share the link if it happens (I hope it does)
Oct 15 22:08:14 <grym>	the only kickstarter i've backed was Thimbleweed Park 
Oct 15 22:08:23 <grym>	which i would look to as an example of how to do it right 
Oct 15 22:08:36 <grym>	but it's a hard row to hoe 
Oct 15 22:10:03 <laertus>	there are other successful open source funding models too
Oct 15 22:10:23 <laertus>	ardour, the profession open source audio editor is funded by donations
Oct 15 22:10:43 <laertus>	iirc, its author lives from the proceeds.. and has been doing so for many, many years
Oct 15 22:11:00 <johnjay>	wasamasa: that was quite a nice story
Oct 15 22:11:32 <laertus>	it's a good book
Oct 15 22:11:53 <wasamasa>	now for comparison, another lisp person story: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/robotandbaby/robotandbaby.html
Oct 15 22:12:27 <terpri>	i'll probably use a liberapay/patreon-type thing to start out with, that seems lower-risk than a kickstarter
Oct 15 22:12:50 <bpalmer>	did gittip shut down?
Oct 15 22:13:23 <bpalmer>	yep, looks so.
Oct 15 22:13:32 <terpri>	and it doesn't have to provide a minimal cost-of-living, just enough to supplement/supplant paying contracts on other projects
Oct 15 22:14:09 <terpri>	(not that i'm aiming low, just considering the failure modes)
Oct 15 22:14:39 <laertus>	terpri: even if you don't do a kickstarter, i think there could be a lot to be learned from successfull kickstarter campaigns, such as how to pitch your project, keep people updated of progress, etc..
Oct 15 22:16:39 <laertus>	though i think the most important thing is a solid track record of delivering results
Oct 15 22:17:09 <grym>	good and honest comms matter a _lot_
Oct 15 22:17:30 <grym>	unfortunately, this is hard to do and a learned skill and being your own PM and marketing group is a giant pain 
Oct 15 22:18:34 <laertus>	it doesn't have to be a whole marketing campaign as such... just maybe a brief video laying out who you are, what you've done, and what you want to do
Oct 15 22:19:08 <grym>	ad copy is hard even at that level if you're not used to it 
Oct 15 22:19:20 <grym>	(i like, detest writing _cover letters_ )
Oct 15 22:19:29 <laertus>	he could get help from it
Oct 15 22:19:45 <laertus>	i found that andy wingo post i linked to earlier pretty persusasive
Oct 15 22:20:18 <laertus>	also, the audience here is mostly technical people.. so we're good with facts..
Oct 15 22:20:52 <laertus>	and the straightforward approach would probably be more effective than snazzy marketingspeak
Oct 15 22:22:29 <grym>	that's the 'honest' above :) 
Oct 15 22:22:33 <grym>	if you're falling over, _tell me_
Oct 15 22:22:47 <grym>	not like i've never been there before
Oct 15 22:23:03 <sam_>	[22:18:11]  <grym> good and honest comms matter a _lot_
Oct 15 22:23:04 <sam_>	yep
Oct 15 22:23:16 <laertus>	and, sorry, i meant "they"
Oct 15 22:23:27 <johnjay>	question for emacs gurus. is there a way of accomplishing keyboard-translate but only for a specific buffer?
Oct 15 22:23:37 *	terpri taking notes
Oct 15 22:23:49 <johnjay>	i suppose something like global-set-key a lot?
Oct 15 22:23:58 <johnjay>	er local-set-key
Oct 15 22:24:20 <johnjay>	local-set-key affects major modes apparently
Oct 15 22:25:49 <grym>	terpri: it's like documentation. everyone wants to just code and document/communicate later, and it never works 
Oct 15 22:25:51 <laertus>	terpri: magit kicskstarter:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1681258897/its-magit-the-magical-git-client  and andrew plotkin on "How I raised $24,000 on Kickstarter" - https://money.cnn.com/2010/11/15/technology/kickstart_plotkin/index.htm
Oct 15 22:26:02 <grym>	thimbleweed's: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thimbleweedpark/thimbleweed-park-a-new-classic-point-and-click-adv/posts 
Oct 15 22:26:10 <grym>	(also, it's a good game!)
Oct 15 22:26:35 <laertus>	though with the caveat that both magit and andrew plotkin's games were hugely beloved by the community before they even opened their mouth to ask for money
Oct 15 22:26:53 <johnjay>	laertus: that's a very different case
Oct 15 22:26:59 <grym>	right; similarly, thimbleweed was "hey remember monkey island? gang's back, y'all!"
Oct 15 22:28:11 <grym>	so there was high community name recognition and assumption of good faith 
Oct 15 22:28:35 <grym>	instead of "who the heck is this and why should i trust them to make a game, games are hard"
Oct 15 22:28:51 <mplsCorwin>	I'd be happy to help with any kickstarter question, to the extent my scars are useful.  24k is *just* over what we raised.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214684691/create-a-cats-laughing-twenty-year-reunion-event-a?ref=user_menu
Oct 15 22:28:52 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/y6SazMSOXE
Oct 15 22:29:01 <grym>	(not implying that the funding under discussion right now falls into the latter case)
Oct 15 22:31:05 <mplsCorwin>	FWIW, the best thing we learned is that having some swag to give away via drawings from people who share the campaign worked really well to help spread it around quicly.
Oct 15 22:31:48 <johnjay>	mplsCorwin: so any successful kickstarter in coding has to start with cute anime girl art. makes sense
Oct 15 22:31:53 <wasamasa>	lol
Oct 15 22:32:01 <mplsCorwin>	proven science fact.
Oct 15 22:32:24 <wasamasa>	you've reminded me that I've got a long way to go with my commissions
Oct 15 22:32:56 <johnjay>	contribute $5 to help linux-tan and scheme-chan develop this new framework
Oct 15 22:33:18 <johnjay>	the higher tiers get you higher badges and more clout within the community. this is gamification
Oct 15 22:37:01 <wasamasa>	I still take advice from people for a proper emacs-tan
Oct 15 22:37:09 <wasamasa>	and whatever else fancies your interest
Oct 15 22:38:17 <johnjay>	that's a tough concept. because you already have concepts for linux and what not. so you'd have to differentiate somehow
Oct 15 22:38:22 <terpri>	i know some good artists and a local screenprinting shop, so swag is doable
Oct 15 22:38:42 <laertus>	terpri: and here's a non-kickstarter example... ardour:  https://community.ardour.org/community  "October goal US$8100 (US$97.2k/yr)" "Goal reached. Thanks so much!"  "Subscribers 4611 US$11112.00/month"
Oct 15 22:38:52 <johnjay>	does swag mean prints or like keychains and such as well?
Oct 15 22:40:24 <mplsCorwin>	swag == stuff we all get, usually t-shirts, posters, yea, keychains.
Oct 15 22:40:26 <laertus>	but, again, ardour's been around for a long time, and a lot of people have been using it for a long time too.. including professionally, for whom donating to keep their tool working is a business expense
Oct 15 22:40:27 <terpri>	maybe t-shirts and posters and mugs and the like, but i'm also imagining a pair of stuffed animals representing the guile baby gnu and the gnu-project gnu
Oct 15 22:41:07 *	wasamasa has flashbacks to RMS on CCC live stream auctioning off a baby gnu plush
Oct 15 22:41:15 <johnjay>	>gnu plush
Oct 15 22:41:23 <mplsCorwin>	johnjay: the key thing is that SWAG is collectible but not unique.  Hard to get over time but not at the time.
Oct 15 22:41:45 <wasamasa>	he made like 50€ off it IIRC
Oct 15 22:41:46 *	mplsCorwin pulls string  "FREE ME"
Oct 15 22:41:48 <johnjay>	mplsCorwin: so sort of like a "I was at woodstock" type thing?
Oct 15 22:41:56 <terpri>	maybe usb sticks, a 3d-printable statue, signed reference manuals (i'm good at calligraphy and developed an interest in bookbinding from that...)
Oct 15 22:41:57 <mplsCorwin>	johnjay: exactly
Oct 15 22:42:07 <laertus>	RMS could probably have made a lot of money off gnu and fsf if he wanted to... and really start that church of emacs, or at least of Free Software
Oct 15 22:42:09 <mplsCorwin>	terpri: sounds perfect
Oct 15 22:42:39 <johnjay>	i'm not going to say all rich people are evil. because sometimes being rich can help a lot. I think maybe just billionaires are evil. millionaires are fine.
Oct 15 22:42:43 <pjb>	laertus: perhaps he would have had more success, indeed.
Oct 15 22:43:18 <pjb>	All the wanabee billionaires would love GPL!
Oct 15 22:43:51 <laertus>	right.. maybe he could have sold rights to the GPL... :)
Oct 15 22:44:16 <rpav>	the joke would be on them, of course .. it has only lefts
Oct 15 22:45:09 <laertus>	left is the new right
Oct 15 22:45:19 <terpri>	also maybe sponsored commits (in major/minor tiers, obviously a limited supply), a tier where you get a hyperlink from the donor page, that kind of thing
Oct 15 22:45:38 <terpri>	copy the unicode consortium and sponsor-a-symbol ;)
Oct 15 22:46:04 <laertus>	terpri: actually, i like the bug bounty idea.. or donate to get a feature implemented.. i think the latter is how the magit kickstarter got funded
Oct 15 22:46:36 <laertus>	magit's authord had a list of features they promised to implement in a certain timeframe
Oct 15 22:47:43 <laertus>	and pretty much everyone knew he could do it, because he was already so prolific and already made magit the gold standard in vcs interfaces
Oct 15 22:48:13 <laertus>	but i don't think you necessarily have to be magit to get some funding
Oct 15 22:48:37 <mplsCorwin>	A friend is a professional kickstarter organizer and gave us some tips for ours.  One really helpful one was to be very circumspect in planning your stretch goals.  He always lays them all out at the start of the campaign, which I think helps with gamification, "help us unlock".  In some cases they have "mystery" stretch-goals but still they layout the plan to start.
Oct 15 22:49:25 <terpri>	i think i'm okay on the credentials front with my firefox contributions (i was the primary implementor of bignums in FF), plus the technically-successful GSoCs
Oct 15 22:49:49 <mplsCorwin>	Seems legit
Oct 15 22:50:28 <terpri>	yeah, i was thinking of more of a "cathedral" approach rather than just laying out all the long-term stretch goals on day 1
Oct 15 22:51:48 <terpri>	("cathedral" might be the wrong metaphor, but i've done some hacking on the long-term super-secret stretch goals already, just not publicly)
Oct 15 22:52:06 <mplsCorwin>	I think that makes sense in terms of "letting the community drive"; just passing on the "professional advice" as making a living running passion projects (my friend) is something of an accomplishment.  
Oct 15 22:52:55 <mplsCorwin>	Here's his company: https://www.zombieorpheus.com/
Oct 15 22:56:06 <laertus>	another thing that i think is on your side is that a lot of people involved in emacs and gnu and guile are kind of idealistic, and want to see their favorite open source project succeed, instead of going with some commerical product instead
Oct 15 22:56:40 <laertus>	and tech people in general tend to be able to afford to help make that happen
Oct 15 22:56:52 <laertus>	it's just that so often they're not even asked
Oct 15 22:58:55 <laertus>	if they can see that there's a real person behind this project they care so much about, and that here's what they need to make it to the next level, many are willing to help
Oct 15 22:59:46 <laertus>	this, i think, is what the magit kickstarter did so well.. here was this guy who had done such great work for the community, was struggling, and needed help to make magit so much better.. people responded to that
Oct 15 23:00:16 <pottag>	wasamasa: nice new article
Oct 15 23:00:46 <wasamasa>	thanks
Oct 15 23:01:08 <buhman>	where's wasamasa's article?
Oct 15 23:02:53 <aidalgol>	on the darkweb
Oct 15 23:03:22 <wasamasa>	lol
Oct 15 23:03:36 <wasamasa>	that would be the ultimate proof of my web stuff not requiring JS
Oct 15 23:03:55 <wasamasa>	buhman: https://emacsninja.com/posts/worst-reverse-shell-ever.html
Oct 15 23:05:09 <aidalgol>	not necessarily.  some of the dumbest criminals get caught because they enable JS and even flash while on tor
Oct 15 23:06:23 <oats>	Omg buhman
Oct 15 23:06:26 <buhman>	what is this sorcery? I can scroll on wasamasa's website without burning 5 CPU cores at 100% utilization. True wizardy.
Oct 15 23:06:33 <oats>	there's a nick I haven't seen in a long time
Oct 15 23:06:52 <wasamasa>	inorite
Oct 15 23:07:37 <wasamasa>	I still dream of a world where I can just view my content in peace with no cookie notices, paywall nudging or other nonsense
Oct 15 23:08:05 <bremner>	donate to my kickstarter to make that happen
Oct 15 23:08:06 <bpalmer>	C-x C-f my-content.txt RET . 
Oct 15 23:08:14 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: are you thinking of golpher?
Oct 15 23:08:18 <bpalmer>	Now, when it's other people's content that you're reading...
Oct 15 23:08:25 <technomancy>	lol TIL apt has package-specific workaround hacks in the dependency resolution logic
Oct 15 23:08:33 <wasamasa>	I mean other people's content, sorry
Oct 15 23:08:58 <oats>	technomancy, I would be entirely unsurprised to learn apt is made of hacks
Oct 15 23:09:04 <wasamasa>	today I went on a well-known webcomic and it gave me a cookie notice with like a hundred advertiser consents I'd have to click away manually
Oct 15 23:09:57 <wasamasa>	its author is making at least 11k$ on patreon
Oct 15 23:10:05 <wasamasa>	why on earth is this nonsense necessary
Oct 15 23:10:29 <wasamasa>	I wish this were some bad dream, but nope
Oct 15 23:11:55 <technomancy>	oats: my theory is that the only reason apt works as well as it does is that it's built on enormous piles of labor
Oct 15 23:12:30 <johnjay>	And in an age of endless spam, the Sage of the Six Browsing Technologies came forth to save the world and vanquish the tracking.
Oct 15 23:12:55 <johnjay>	technomancy: the nix idea is to make everything reproducible, that's better isn't it?
Oct 15 23:13:09 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Before Patreon's cut and income tax.
Oct 15 23:13:19 <aidalgol>	Is that annually or per month?
Oct 15 23:13:35 <wasamasa>	monthly
Oct 15 23:13:43 <aidalgol>	OK, that's pretty high.
Oct 15 23:13:56 <aidalgol>	This isn't SMBC or xkcd, is it?
Oct 15 23:13:59 <wasamasa>	nope
Oct 15 23:14:19 <wasamasa>	but really, it doesn't matter, far from the only webcomic doing that
Oct 15 23:14:26 <technomancy>	johnjay: yeah the idea is that a build is a function of its inputs instead of just "lol run a shell script I guess and think very hard about it first"
Oct 15 23:14:26 <wasamasa>	I've noticed the same pattern with a few more
Oct 15 23:14:26 <aidalgol>	just wondering
Oct 15 23:14:56 <johnjay>	laertus: bug bounties and feature req would have to be a big thing
Oct 15 23:15:11 <wasamasa>	and it makes me wonder whether I should rather use my mad h4xx0r sk1llz to instead free the few sites I care about from that bullshit
Oct 15 23:15:12 <aidalgol>	technomancy: To be fair, apt is pretty old.  I don't really expect a distribution to rewrite their package manager in FP instead of improving a known quantity.
Oct 15 23:15:13 <johnjay>	i recall donating one time to a browser extension with a request for a minor feature, got told lol no but thanks for $$$
Oct 15 23:15:54 <aidalgol>	I don't think I want to live in a world where OSS features go to the highest bidder.
Oct 15 23:16:27 <johnjay>	i guess not. but i mean it was a small thing imo. on an hourly basis 5 or 10 bucks would mean it would be profitable to do it in 1 hour
Oct 15 23:16:41 <wasamasa>	anyway, I'm sure someone caring enough will find out because I ranted about this webcomic before, though for a different reason
Oct 15 23:16:47 <johnjay>	aidalgol: what about multiple bidders crowdsourcing the next tier?
Oct 15 23:17:13 <technomancy>	aidalgol: no, it's not reasonable to expect them to rewrite it
Oct 15 23:17:37 <aidalgol>	technomancy: BTW, nix and guix need to flesh out their documentation a bit.
Oct 15 23:17:45 <technomancy>	aidalgol: it's more that the whole mindset of "run a shell script to install" can't be expected to work at the scale of debian without enormous mountains of manual labor
Oct 15 23:18:38 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Maintaining a distribution is going to be an enormous mountain of manual labor, and I don't see using FP magically diminishing that.
Oct 15 23:18:44 <laertus>	aidalgol: would you rather live in a world where the software you care about got the features and bugfixes you wanted maybe, if its author cared about them and had spare time from actually making a living?
Oct 15 23:19:02 <technomancy>	aidalgol: it depends on the cost of your mistakes
Oct 15 23:19:25 <laertus>	people getting paid for open source work is kind of close to a utopia for me... only thing better is for no one to need money to survive in the first place
Oct 15 23:19:37 <aidalgol>	laertus: I'd rather live in a world where we didn't have to worry about money.
Oct 15 23:19:39 <technomancy>	aidalgol: under apt, mistakes are immensely costly, which forces you to move much more slowly. if you have guaranteed rollback, mistakes tend to be very cheap.
Oct 15 23:19:59 <aidalgol>	technomancy: True.  I shouldn't have to rely on the root filesystem to be able to easily roll back.
Oct 15 23:19:59 <laertus>	aidalgol: me too.. but the world doesn't seem to be headed in that direction any time soon
Oct 15 23:20:16 <technomancy>	"never make a single mistake" takes an enormous amount of work. "sometimes make mistakes, and then roll them back trivially" can be done a lot more easily.
Oct 15 23:20:17 <hodapp>	nix (and nixpkgs, and nixos) docs are sometimes great, and sometimes they're just fucking horrid
Oct 15 23:20:32 <aidalgol>	what hodapp siad
Oct 15 23:20:44 <aidalgol>	hodapp: Hey, you haven't been getting offby1 to throw his dentures at you lately
Oct 15 23:20:45 <hodapp>	there's a lot of cargo culting I see in nixpkgs because there is just no other way to get an answer on the "right" way to do something
Oct 15 23:21:00 <hodapp>	so you grep around in nixpkgs and find a way that at least works, and copy it
Oct 15 23:21:02 <aidalgol>	laertus: But yeah, in the mean time, crowd sourced OSS would be better than what we have now: begging for corporations
Oct 15 23:21:02 <technomancy>	I'm not saying guix is great; just that they at least have a shot at accomplishing a lot more with a lot less, because their underlying model is superior.
Oct 15 23:21:36 <aidalgol>	laertus: Let's just temper our enthusiasm so we don't lower our standards.
Oct 15 23:21:38 <hodapp>	so I love NixOS, but this is a thing I hate about all of it
Oct 15 23:22:24 <hodapp>	the thing I just ran into is "JACK and PulseAudio can't play nice together and no one has any up-to-date answer on the proper way to solve it, so here is a pile of hacks that might work"
Oct 15 23:22:37 <technomancy>	that's not specific to nixos
Oct 15 23:22:48 <johnjay>	i forgot guix and nix are different
Oct 15 23:23:07 <johnjay>	so guix is the gnu nix ok
Oct 15 23:23:13 <hodapp>	it's a problem that happens elsewhere, but there seem to be NixOS pecularities to it
Oct 15 23:23:30 <johnjay>	but there's no guix linux, guix is just a program/system?
Oct 15 23:23:36 <hodapp>	GuixSD
Oct 15 23:23:59 <johnjay>	hrm. that seems weird to me. do you need a different distro for this?
Oct 15 23:24:07 <hodapp>	GuixSD *is* the distro
Oct 15 23:24:23 <johnjay>	also wait. linux-libre???
Oct 15 23:24:23 <fsbot>	It is certain!
Oct 15 23:24:28 <johnjay>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-libre
Oct 15 23:25:56 <hodapp>	my other annoyance is how much the Nix language seems to lend itself to errors that occur 18 levels deep in the stack trace
Oct 15 23:25:59 <grym>	wasamasa: re emacs-tan, what are the restrictions on that image you've shared here a few times
Oct 15 23:26:00 <hodapp>	because I got a type wrong or something
Oct 15 23:26:12 <hodapp>	because no one bloody documented it and I was just taking my best gues
Oct 15 23:26:13 <wasamasa>	grym: not sure what you're talking about
Oct 15 23:26:44 <grym>	wasamasa: http://x32.be/oc/emacs/rye-emacs-bg.png  or it might've been another regular? 
Oct 15 23:26:48 <wasamasa>	grym: I commissioned an artist and named a few things that ended up being too vague and too specific at the same time
Oct 15 23:27:31 <wasamasa>	grym: oh wait, are you telling me I own that picture now and can actually try to enforce rights of its usage?
Oct 15 23:28:00 <grym>	wasamasa: no i am asking about its provenance
Oct 15 23:28:10 <grym>	or not provenance, rights
Oct 15 23:28:12 <wasamasa>	I just told you
Oct 15 23:28:47 <mplsCorwin>	"Should I pay someone $5 or something if wanna reblog?"  is maybe the question?
Oct 15 23:28:54 <grym>	^ that's closer, yeah 
Oct 15 23:28:58 <grym>	sorry if that was vague
Oct 15 23:29:37 <wasamasa>	ah, so you want to actually reproduce that one?
Oct 15 23:30:03 <grym>	or just like, feel good about having a copy on my hard drive 
Oct 15 23:31:00 <wasamasa>	I don't see the harm with that
Oct 15 23:31:38 <wasamasa>	I've never asked the artist about how licensing plays into this and as long as nobody is reselling that picture or otherwise profiting off it, I don't care
Oct 15 23:32:00 <wasamasa>	but I don't want to put it explicitly under such a license without having cleared that with the artist, so uh
Oct 15 23:32:28 <grym>	no smearing it over the blog background 1998 style, got it 
Oct 15 23:32:50 <wasamasa>	yeah, no "You made this? I made this."
Oct 15 23:33:34 <terpri>	wasamasa, thanks for updating the emacsninja post. i'm going to poke around and see what's causing the pessimization (parts of guile-elisp are written without any consideration given to optimization, since atm emacs eventually clobbers most of the definitions in practice, but it shouldn't be *that* bad)
Oct 15 23:37:59 <terpri>	and yes, the primitives are extremely limited, only what was needed to bootstrap emacs $n$ years ago (i'll fix print though; i forgot that it should add newlines on both sides, though given my nick you'd expect me to know the lisp i/o functions by heart ;))
Oct 15 23:38:26 <wasamasa>	haha
Oct 15 23:41:02 <laertus>	guile emacs lives!
Oct 16 00:10:57 <aidalgol>	,sedate laertus 
Oct 16 00:10:57 *	fsbot clubs laertus on the head. laertus sleeps soundly.
Oct 16 00:11:30 <laertus>	,botsmack
Oct 16 00:11:31 *	fsbot evades!
Oct 16 00:22:37 <johnjay>	ok i'm probably going insane but
Oct 16 00:22:56 <johnjay>	when i assign fancy-splash-image to the literal image emacs uses for the splash screen, splash.png, it fails to work
Oct 16 00:23:06 <johnjay>	when i dont' do that it does work. this is 26.3
Oct 16 00:24:30 <johnjay>	on debian this is "/usr/share/emacs/26.3/etc/images/splash.png"
Oct 16 00:25:13 <laertus>	can you describe in more detail what happens when it fails to work?
Oct 16 00:25:41 <terpri>	i saved the last bit of the backlog, so i'll ping those of who expressed interest once there when there is more news in a few weeks (after i'm less busy with $work; in the meantime i'll ruminate (gno pun intended) on the next $n$ Year Plan and try to estimate just how painful rebasing will be this time around). and thanks to everyone who offered advice and constructive critique
Oct 16 00:25:56 <johnjay>	no. i just don't see the image appear. no error message in echo area
Oct 16 00:27:16 <johnjay>	been driving me crazy for last 15 minutes, so i give up lol
Oct 16 00:27:20 <laertus>	terpri: looking forward to it
Oct 16 00:27:33 <johnjay>	i tried other pngs before this obviously, xpm as well. nothing
Oct 16 00:27:36 <laertus>	johnjay: you could try an strace of emacs
Oct 16 00:27:50 <johnjay>	hrm, meaning the library could be failing?
Oct 16 00:28:02 <laertus>	meaning it might not be looking where you think it's looking
Oct 16 00:28:09 <laertus>	if it's looking at all
Oct 16 00:28:12 <johnjay>	oh right
Oct 16 00:28:19 <laertus>	if it does try to look there, strace should show it
Oct 16 00:28:54 <laertus>	this is kind of a low-level approach to troubleshooting this.. but i have no idea how emacs does its splash magic, so until someone has a better suggestion...
Oct 16 00:29:18 <laertus>	another thing you could do is search for that variable name in the code
Oct 16 00:29:25 <laertus>	see what touches it
Oct 16 00:29:32 <johnjay>	i don't see the image file mentioned in strace at all
Oct 16 00:29:42 <johnjay>	not name not png
Oct 16 00:29:51 <johnjay>	it's in startup.el
Oct 16 00:29:58 <johnjay>	just search for 'png and you see it
Oct 16 00:30:02 <laertus>	regarding the strace, you might need to run it with a high numerical value of the -s option
Oct 16 00:30:15 <laertus>	as by default strace does not show full strings
Oct 16 00:31:13 <laertus>	if it doesn't show up in strace there, it's likely that emacs isn't even looking for the image for some reason
Oct 16 00:31:25 <johnjay>	haha it's not loading a png file for the regular splash image either
Oct 16 00:31:32 <terpri>	johnjay, you could use debug-on-entry whatever function is responsible for inserting the splash image (possibly fancy-startup-screen?)
Oct 16 00:31:36 <johnjay>	wtf
Oct 16 00:35:41 <jlf>	johnjay: maybe check ,,dv image-types
Oct 16 00:35:43 <fsbot>	List of potentially supported image types.
Oct 16 00:35:43 <fsbot>	Each element of the list is a symbol for an image type, like ‘jpeg’ or ‘png’.
Oct 16 00:35:43 <fsbot>	To check whether it is really supported, use ‘image-type-available-p’.
Oct 16 00:35:54 <johnjay>	i think use-fancy-splash-screens-p is always returning nil for some reason
Oct 16 00:36:01 <johnjay>	yes that returns true for png
Oct 16 00:38:11 <johnjay>	surely this isnt' a big
Oct 16 00:38:36 <johnjay>	what happens if you set fancy-splash-image to an absolute path of a png file?
Oct 16 00:38:46 <johnjay>	in init.el i mean.
Oct 16 00:38:50 <terpri>	johnjay, or, maybe more simply, jump to the definition of whatever actually inserts the splash image, edebug with C-u C-M-x, kill the "*GNU Emacs*" buffer and then M-: (display-startup-screen) so you can step through the code
Oct 16 00:39:01 <terpri>	s/simply/usefully/ :)
Oct 16 00:39:21 <johnjay>	right that fails. but i suspect i'm just doing it wrong
Oct 16 00:40:38 <buhman>	wasamasa: "Much like with the reverse shell" shouldn't that be "bind shell"?
Oct 16 00:43:44 <johnjay>	so this line is failing because 9 is not bigger than 28
Oct 16 00:43:47 <johnjay>	 (> frame-height (+ image-height 19))
Oct 16 00:43:59 <johnjay>	but 9 should be bigger than 28
Oct 16 00:45:05 <johnjay>	or wait no it's 24 > 28 that is failing
Oct 16 00:46:07 <laertus>	so your frame is too small?
Oct 16 00:48:13 <aidalgol>	Is there some way I can have `compile' cd to a specific directory in the current project before running the command?  Even running some external before a && in the command passed to `compile' that can do this would be fine.
Oct 16 00:48:49 <aidalgol>	Are there any CLI tools for navigating "projects"?  As in with similar commands to projectile.
Oct 16 00:48:53 <aidalgol>	But outside Emacs.
Oct 16 00:48:55 <johnjay>	ok i think i got it. when i shrink the image down to 100x100 it does display
Oct 16 00:49:07 <johnjay>	it's checking if the frame height is bigger than the image height plus 19 or something weird
Oct 16 00:49:14 <aidalgol>	Oh wait, there's a projectile compile command...
Oct 16 00:49:24 <johnjay>	i guess my frame is indeed too small
Oct 16 00:49:47 <johnjay>	although the fact it fails on also the emacs logo png file itself makes me think this is still a bug of some kind
Oct 16 00:50:11 <aidalgol>	Some of the docstrings are a bit lacking.
Oct 16 00:50:36 <aidalgol>	`projectile-compilation-dir': Retrieve the compilation directory for this project.
Oct 16 00:50:43 <aidalgol>	Yes, thanks, *how*?  How do I configure that?
Oct 16 00:50:54 <aidalgol>	(Rhetorical question.  I'm reading the source now.)
Oct 16 00:51:50 <johnjay>	maybe it's because my display is 1024x768 or something
Oct 16 00:52:09 <johnjay>	i'm not setting frame height or width in my init.el

Oct 16 08:39:12 <bpalmer>	Let's stack the odds in how the world ends.
Oct 16 08:42:04 <mplsCorwin>	kudahtor228: I'm giving up, at least for now.  I was able to install tidy but I get some "I'm giving up, at least for now.  I was able to install tidy" which replaces the buffer contents when I run tidy-buffer.   I might try more later but this package may be ded pending more heroic efforts.
Oct 16 08:42:33 <mplsCorwin>	c/p fail.  The error is   The system cannot find the path specified.
Oct 16 08:44:58 <bpalmer>	Hmm. 
Oct 16 09:29:51 <thomasb06>	Hello. When I type M-x diff-mode, my buffer loses coloration and nothing else happens. It takes to revert it to recover the coloration
Oct 16 09:36:36 <twb>	Is there an open source engine for X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter series?
Oct 16 09:36:51 <twb>	It came out in the 1990s so you'd think there'd be one by now
Oct 16 09:38:16 <bpalmer>	thomasb06: what are you trying to do?
Oct 16 09:39:17 <thomasb06>	bpalmer to diff the file in the buffer with another one
Oct 16 09:40:38 <thomasb06>	maybe it's M-x diff only?
Oct 16 09:41:51 <bpalmer>	M-x diff RET  will ask you for two files to diff; see also diff-buffers  and diff-buffer-with-file
Oct 16 09:42:42 <bpalmer>	there's also ediff-file and ediff-buffers , if you prefer ediff to diff
Oct 16 09:43:10 <thomasb06>	bpalmer perfect, thank you
Oct 16 09:48:19 <wasamasa>	buhman: thanks, fixed
Oct 16 09:50:30 <wasamasa>	johnjay: I still have hopes of emulating CP/M or another simplicistic OS
Oct 16 09:50:48 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: not sure what you mean, but feel free to give me a run-down
Oct 16 09:51:06 <wasamasa>	thblt: lol, the newest RMS mail on him hoping MELPA isn't well-known
Oct 16 09:51:27 <thomasb06>	ediff leaves the highlighting in the buffer after closing one of the two buffer compared
Oct 16 09:53:22 <wasamasa>	thblt: and yes, I did point that exchange thing out, see https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-05/msg03041.html
Oct 16 09:56:42 <bpalmer>	It does somewhat amuse me that one of the easiest ways to gather evidence about whether a minority of emacs users know about melpa seems to be precluded from asking about it, in rms's mind.

Oct 16 09:57:36 <wasamasa>	it's funny because he gets reinforcement to this theory on emacs-devel a few posts later
Oct 16 09:57:38 <bpalmer>	Yes, precisely the message I was thinking of.
Oct 16 09:57:46 <wasamasa>	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg00956.html
Oct 16 09:57:51 <mplsCorwin>	I quoted it sometime back.

Oct 16 09:58:52 <mplsCorwin>	which is correct afict
Oct 16 10:00:05 <bpalmer>	'AFAIK, both Trisquel and Parabola keep out packages that recommend or encourage proprietary software, which seems essential to protect users' freedom' -- in order to save the village, one must destroy it.
Oct 16 10:01:50 <mplsCorwin>	The secret to freedom is limiting the field so the remaining choices are aways free.  I'm actually a little dizzy trying to make a non-cynical spin for it.
Oct 16 10:07:12 <wasamasa>	lol, RMS enabling an emacs DoS: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg00968.html
Oct 16 10:07:23 <wasamasa>	he had good intentions, I swear
Oct 16 10:08:11 <wasamasa>	good to see people don't only get chewed out for mentioning the possibility of changing a default
Oct 16 10:12:43 <codingquark>	May be some people want to live the restrictive FLOSS life, some do not. No need to say the other is wrong
Oct 16 10:13:56 <thblt>	It's not even that.  Melpa isn't more or less “free” than ELPA, it just isn't vetted by the FSF.
Oct 16 10:14:07 <codingquark>	"I want to distro that forbids me from installing the software that does not align with my ideology" is equally okay as "I want a distro that comes with the software that does align with my ideology, but sometimes I cheat"
Oct 16 10:14:32 <thblt>	The thing that makes mailing lists unsufferable is that points need to be made again and again, because they keep getting ignored.
Oct 16 10:14:46 <codingquark>	Now, as a distro maker, one has to decide which path they want to take.
Oct 16 10:15:24 <codingquark>	Hmm, one would think mailing lists are great because people take a lot of time in writing their long messages /s

Oct 16 10:18:05 <bpalmer>	well, there's an issue with threaded discussion where messages are read and replied to asynchronously. This is arguably one argument for gmail-like "conversation" threads; you known precisely what messages someone is supposed to be aware of by where they are in the conversation (and what they quoted in their invariable top-posting)
Oct 16 10:25:47 <laertus>	i've been surfing through the emacs stackexchange recently, and am kind of getting the impression that drew adams almost singlehandedly answers all the questions on there
Oct 16 10:26:18 <laertus>	virtually every answer i find on there is by drew
Oct 16 10:26:19 <mplsCorwin>	I see Lars sometimes too.
Oct 16 10:27:55 <bpalmer>	Let's collect all the points to keep the area child-safe.
Oct 16 10:37:25 <laertus>	speaking of children... i wonder what the record for the youngest emacs user is
Oct 16 10:39:01 <laertus>	probably pretty young these days... lucky kids...
Oct 16 10:40:02 <laertus>	one day i'm going to hear "i've been using emacs since i was 2 years old.."
Oct 16 10:41:51 <aidalgol>	I started in high school...
Oct 16 10:42:56 <DuClare>	and ended in low school..
Oct 16 10:45:47 <laertus>	kids will be getting in to fights over vim vs emacs on the playground
Oct 16 10:46:13 <laertus>	and growing up in families where everybody uses emacs..
Oct 16 10:46:57 <laertus>	starting in high school is pretty good
Oct 16 10:47:09 <thblt>	Two editors, both alike in dignity, in the kindergarten where we lay our scene.
Oct 16 10:47:54 <snan>	I was 18 or 19 when I started using emacs T_T probably pretty common age for that
Oct 16 10:48:27 <thblt>	Wow I was looking for Act I scene 1 to continue my stupidity and I found this annotated version https://myshakespeare.com/romeo-and-juliet/act-1-scene-1
Oct 16 10:48:42 <thblt>	It's even better than parallel texts.
Oct 16 10:48:49 <thblt>	Where do I put my money?
Oct 16 10:51:05 <twb>	OK so I have a science question
Oct 16 10:51:12 <twb>	you know how fruits are basically plant genitals
Oct 16 10:51:26 <twb>	and they trick animals into eating the fruit because then they walk around and shit out the seed somewhere
Oct 16 10:51:30 <twb>	SO.
Oct 16 10:51:37 <twb>	Mangos are quite big, and the seed is quite big
Oct 16 10:51:50 <twb>	Are there animals big enough to eat a whole mango and shit out the seed?
Oct 16 10:52:00 <twb>	The only thing I can think of that big is a hippo or an elephant
Oct 16 10:52:14 <aidalgol>	How does this work with bananas?
Oct 16 10:52:27 <twb>	aidalgol: same
Oct 16 10:52:31 <twb>	banana seeds are also quite large
Oct 16 10:52:50 <twb>	(if you only eat whitefella bananas, those are all sterile clones with no/broken seeds)
Oct 16 10:58:29 <laertus>	maybe mango seeds were spread around in prehistoric times by dinosaurs
Oct 16 11:01:54 <wawrek>	is there a way of creating a few emacs profiles? I need it to edit text files and to code. So, I would like to have 2 separate profiles with different init.el files
Oct 16 11:07:23 <snan>	wawrek:  emacs -ql profileb.el
Oct 16 11:08:06 <snan>	Emacs also has "modes" so you can use one mode (like text-mode) to write text files, and javascript-mode or whatever language you like to code
Oct 16 11:08:22 <snan>	Instead of using separate init.el files
Oct 16 11:08:31 <zmagii>	twb: Monkeys tend to walk around with mangos and then drop them somewhere, but also, not convinced that pre-domestication mangos are that large.
Oct 16 11:08:41 <wawrek>	snan: I have modes - I enable all of them in the init.el file 
Oct 16 11:09:19 <snan>	That's great. So when editing text just use text mode and when coding just use coding modes♥
Oct 16 11:09:21 <snan>	Worx great♥
Oct 16 11:09:29 <wawrek>	I have python mode that loads when I open a py file; text mode loads when I open a txt file
Oct 16 11:10:02 <wawrek>	lots of them need to be loaded for coding - that is why they are in init.el
Oct 16 11:15:00 <laertus>	what is the problem you're trying to solve by having a separate profile for editing text vs code?
Oct 16 11:15:52 <laertus>	wawrek: ^
Oct 16 11:16:41 <bremner>	wawrek: the idiomatic solution is to autoload modes when you need them
Oct 16 11:18:50 <twb>	zmagii: sensible
Oct 16 11:19:01 <twb>	zmagii: looking at cultivars I notied some next to SD cards
Oct 16 11:21:34 <wasamasa>	laertus: I used to answer a lot more questions, but now most stuff does have answers when I get to it
Oct 16 11:21:41 <wasamasa>	laertus: the only tag I can answer properly is evil
Oct 16 11:21:50 <wasamasa>	laertus: that's where drew isn't entirely sure :D
Oct 16 11:22:13 <laertus>	yeah, i've seen you on there a lot too
Oct 16 11:22:33 <wasamasa>	I still low-key want to reach 20k and then leave the account alone
Oct 16 11:23:50 <laertus>	one thing i've always been worried about is what if the company that owns stackexchange ever dies or decides not to host them anymore, or just screws it up somehow
Oct 16 11:24:00 <laertus>	there's a lot of super useful information on there
Oct 16 11:24:27 <laertus>	it'd be a tragedy if it was ever lost or made inaccessible
Oct 16 11:27:07 <edgar-rft>	rudybot: let's sing an emacs gosp.el
Oct 16 11:27:15 <rudybot>	edgar-rft: I was going to say I figured you'd be contractually obligated to sing praise for all of El Goog's creations. :P
Oct 16 11:43:40 <zmagii>	My Python setup in Emacs breaks over to the following line at 80 chars, but the error check wants it at 79. So all of my indents say "E501 line too long 80 > 79".
Oct 16 12:38:08 <thomasb06>	Hello. Ediff keeps the highlighting on after closing one of the two files, how to turn it off?
Oct 16 13:15:31 <refusenick>	Anyone know if there's a reason why the pgtk nativecomp branch shouldn't work with EXWM?

Oct 16 19:42:28 <kudahtor228>	just exports as-is
Oct 16 19:44:49 <wasamasa>	lol, does savannah seriously have stored xss from project names
Oct 16 19:44:50 <wasamasa>	seriously
Oct 16 19:45:08 <wasamasa>	and this guy lectures us how awful github's security must be
Oct 16 19:45:21 <wasamasa>	what a joke
Oct 16 19:46:29 <wasamasa>	this makes me want to quote the old testament
Oct 16 19:46:59 <grym>	on a scale of 0 to spicy, how hot do you want it 
Oct 16 19:47:05 <sbilik>	Is there a good emacs package that can do something like what workspaces does in tiling window managers?? i.e. put erc buffers in one workspace, code in another, shells in another, etc. All easily swappable with a key combination?
Oct 16 19:48:58 <kudahtor228>	sbilik: yes tabs have arrived in version 27
Oct 16 19:49:02 <kudahtor228>	M-x tab-bar
Oct 16 19:49:23 <kudahtor228>	also, there are frames. F10-> new frame
Oct 16 19:49:46 <sbilik>	Yep, saw that. Are the tabs akin to buffers or frames?
Oct 16 19:50:05 <kudahtor228>	frames but not sure
Oct 16 19:50:32 <kudahtor228>	I also use ace-window to comfortably switch between buffers, and VTERM which doesnt require C-c
Oct 16 19:50:53 <kudahtor228>	I think frames are there for multiple displays but not sure
Oct 16 19:52:07 <sbilik>	Thanks. I tried the M-x tab-bar-mode and it seems to do okay keeping different frame setups. I'd thought of it as having individual buffers, not layouts. So... good to know. I've been on Emacs since v18 but hadn't played with this much since it is so new.
Oct 16 20:00:06 <laertus>	i'm not a fan of the tab-bar
Oct 16 20:00:17 <laertus>	you can't rearrange the tabs, afaik
Oct 16 20:00:34 <johnjay>	what
Oct 16 20:00:37 <wasamasa>	yeah and I'm not in the mood of adding any new functionality to eyebrowse either
Oct 16 20:00:55 <laertus>	they don't auto-resize based on how many tabs there are and the lengths of their names
Oct 16 20:01:06 <laertus>	eyebrowse is cool... i still use it
Oct 16 20:01:13 <parsnip>	is tab-bar fixed in macos?
Oct 16 20:01:22 <johnjay>	resize is bad. you want it so if you click X to close a tab the next tab X appears under the mouse cursor
Oct 16 20:01:41 <laertus>	i don't click
Oct 16 20:01:53 <laertus>	i use emacs in the terminal.. completely mouseless
Oct 16 20:02:04 <johnjay>	What if I told you... you can use the mouse in the terminal?
Oct 16 20:02:07 <parsnip>	can't mouse work in some terminal apps?
Oct 16 20:02:23 <wasamasa>	anyway, should I bother reproducing this undoubtedly super serious vulnerability in savannah and report it properly
Oct 16 20:02:25 <johnjay>	also Morpheus never said "What if I told you"
Oct 16 20:02:40 <laertus>	johnjay: i have used the mouse before in the terminal.. i know some apps can recognize it, but i prefer not to.. the most i do with the mouse is select and paste outside of emacs
Oct 16 20:02:45 <wasamasa>	or should I let it use the same security strategy as emacs and just hope it flies under the radar
Oct 16 20:03:04 <laertus>	report it :P
Oct 16 20:03:07 <parsnip>	wasamasa: tell us more 🍿
Oct 16 20:03:12 <johnjay>	wasamasa: when they've felt enough pain they will change their behavior. this attitude is useful on many occassions
Oct 16 20:03:43 <wasamasa>	the thing is, this feels too much like work
Oct 16 20:04:21 <johnjay>	where would you submit the bug anyway? a mail list?
Oct 16 20:04:26 <wasamasa>	great question
Oct 16 20:04:41 <laertus>	email rms
Oct 16 20:04:42 <wasamasa>	normally I'd have to play security theater and find a dedicated contact address
Oct 16 20:04:52 <parsnip>	send one email to mailing list, and then don't ever respond
Oct 16 20:04:58 <wasamasa>	but it's too late
Oct 16 20:05:14 <wasamasa>	anyone who takes a look at their html knows it's screwed up beyond repair
Oct 16 20:05:33 <wasamasa>	there is nothing to responsibly disclose
Oct 16 20:06:09 <npostavs>	"stored xss from project names" - meaning you put javascript in the project name?
Oct 16 20:06:12 <johnjay>	In computer security or elsewhere, responsible disclosure is a vulnerability disclosure model in which a vulnerability or an issue is disclosed only after a period of time that allows for the vulnerability or issue to be patched or mended. This period distinguishes the model from full disclosure
Oct 16 20:06:43 <wasamasa>	npostavs: it appears that this is possible, yes
Oct 16 20:06:59 <wasamasa>	npostavs: take a look at this gem: https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/webxml
Oct 16 20:07:13 <wasamasa>	npostavs: now take a look at the page source and see if you notice something
Oct 16 20:08:52 <npostavs>	wasamasa: hah, based on http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/HowToGetYourProjectApprovedQuickly/ you need a human to approve your project name, so putting in any significant amount of javascript doesn't seem viable, but it's funny that they let that through...
Oct 16 20:09:10 <wasamasa>	that is indeed funny
Oct 16 20:09:19 <wasamasa>	anyway, I bet this is far from the only one
Oct 16 20:10:37 <bandali>	wasamasa, please write to savannah-hackers-private@gnu.org
Oct 16 20:11:04 <bandali>	and indeed, projects require manual on savannah
Oct 16 20:11:15 <wasamasa>	no need, the stringent review will catch everything (or so someone particularly irritating on emacs-devel claims)
Oct 16 20:11:15 <bandali>	s/manual/manual approval/
Oct 16 20:11:45 <wasamasa>	I'll treat this as a false positive and give the project a more thorough look later
Oct 16 20:11:50 <bandali>	i haven't been able to emacs-devel for a few weeks now so idk
Oct 16 20:11:56 <bandali>	able to follow
Oct 16 20:12:03 <bandali>	jesus fuck i can't think or write today
Oct 16 20:12:17 <wasamasa>	worry not, I've got you: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01015.html
Oct 16 20:12:57 <bandali>	oh it's jean louis
Oct 16 20:14:03 <tromey>	meh
Oct 16 20:15:59 <yates>	is there an elisp function or package which "urlifies" a string" so that e.g. "my string" gets converted to "my%20string"?
Oct 16 20:16:30 <wasamasa>	several I bet
Oct 16 20:16:40 <wasamasa>	I found such code in files.el, lol
Oct 16 20:16:58 <yates>	actually my immediate problem is converting "c++" to "c%2B%2B"
Oct 16 20:17:01 <wasamasa>	and browse-url.el
Oct 16 20:17:23 <wasamasa>	and mailclient.el
Oct 16 20:17:29 <yates>	browse-url does not 
Oct 16 20:17:33 <wasamasa>	and gnus-util.el
Oct 16 20:17:36 <yates>	(at least not by default)
Oct 16 20:17:45 <npostavs>	url-hexify-string is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in ‘url-util.el’.
Oct 16 20:18:00 <wasamasa>	that's the one
Oct 16 20:18:09 <wasamasa>	the rest should really be adapted to use that instead
Oct 16 20:18:42 <yates>	+1
Oct 16 20:18:49 <yates>	thanks people
Oct 16 20:19:40 <wasamasa>	> So, next time somebody thinks of proprietary software, just remember, we are watching... slap on fingers.
Oct 16 20:20:06 <wasamasa>	reminds me of Dave Chapelle
Oct 16 20:20:40 <wasamasa>	rudybot: what did the proprietary thought police say to the fingers? slap!
Oct 16 20:20:51 <rudybot>	wasamasa: > So, next time somebody thinks of proprietary software, just remember, we are watching... slap on fingers.
Oct 16 20:24:59 <dale>	What does it mean when rudybot replies but puts a * next to your nick?  I think I've only seen this done for offby1, is that because offby1 has special rudybot privileges or something?
Oct 16 20:27:21 <edgar-rft>	offby1 *is* rudybot :-)
Oct 16 20:27:48 <edgar-rft>	...or at least its creator
Oct 16 20:27:50 <dale>	He's very fast at coming up with these responses, then.
Oct 16 20:27:55 <dale>	Seems like he should automate it.
Oct 16 20:28:05 <dale>	Right, that's what I was referring to when I said "special privileges".
Oct 16 20:28:43 <physikoi>	Hello #emacs. I'm trying to use emacs in tmux, but common tmux prefixes of C-a and C-b obviously conflict highly with emacs bindings. I can't seem to unbind C-a as prefix. Halp? https://www.dropbox.com/s/ody3sa2mwbmpzfo/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-16%20at%203.27.28%20PM.png?dl=0
Oct 16 20:28:52 <dale>	I just found it odd that the bot should need to acknowledge this in every response.  I used to think it happened when the rudybot replied with something you  yourself previously said, but it didn't do it just now with wasamasa.
Oct 16 20:29:26 <johnjay>	wasamasa: oh noes, emacs is not crisply organized into an STL like python
Oct 16 20:29:35 <wasamasa>	STL?
Oct 16 20:29:35 <fsbot>	STL: [0] Standard Template Library, originally the name of a non-ANSI library published by SGI, now most commonly used to refer to the templates in the standard C++ library
Oct 16 20:29:36 <fsbot>	[1] Mostly an outdated term for "the C++ standard library" for when this library sucked and wasn't part of C++.
Oct 16 20:29:36 <johnjay>	i guess this is why we do not speak of the ESL. or EML
Oct 16 20:29:42 <parsnip>	yeah my logs have "rudybot\t\*"
Oct 16 20:30:04 <johnjay>	haha it's an outdated term? damn

Oct 16 21:04:27 <bpalmer>	I believe both hg and git ignore files ending in ~ by default, so you may be better off doin any such cleanup *after* you have commited the tree.

Oct 16 21:08:04 <yates>	i don't delete them _regularly_. did i say _regularly_?  only when I'm about to add some folders and subfolders. 
Oct 16 21:08:11 <yates>	otherwise i leave'em be
Oct 16 21:08:38 <yates>	it was just a tip. of course you could set that in the ignre filter too
Oct 16 21:11:08 <yates>	i just often find that i added folders/subfolders, edited files there so that there are a bunch of extraneous "*~", and to manually clean them up is stupid tedious. 
Oct 16 21:11:41 <yates>	maybe i should rethink the ignore filter approach.

Oct 16 21:22:38 <grym>	ooo TIL helm-lastpass
Oct 16 21:22:56 <wasamasa>	damnit, another poor soul lost
Oct 16 21:24:08 <wrycode>	it's almost as if emacs is important enough to have russia creating troll accounts
Oct 16 21:24:12 <wrycode>	alas
Oct 16 21:24:14 <wasamasa>	I really do wonder whether there's a language barrier as the answer do dgutov's concern about needless in-fighting is "Well, here's an issue, let's see how they reply"
Oct 16 21:24:16 <wrycode>	they're real
Oct 16 21:24:30 <wasamasa>	that doesn't help with the in-fighting, it strengthens it
Oct 16 21:24:57 <grym>	i have a corporate lastpass, but i don't actually want to bolt it into my editor 
Oct 16 21:29:02 <johnw>	I like password-store.el
Oct 16 21:29:44 <wasamasa>	I wrote a few lines of code for pass

Oct 16 21:37:42 <johnjay>	wasamasa: i feel like writing a few lines of code for emacs is impossible
Oct 16 21:37:58 <johnjay>	because you'd have to go through the bother of getting copyright assignment etc
Oct 16 21:38:03 <johnjay>	so you may as well just put something on melpa.
Oct 16 21:38:08 <johnjay>	like that url thing you mentioned
Oct 16 21:38:09 <wasamasa>	I meant my init file, lol
Oct 16 21:38:26 <wasamasa>	copyright assignment is mostly a waiting game
Oct 16 21:38:29 <johnw>	johnjay: you can sign a blanket assignment
Oct 16 21:38:42 <wasamasa>	the real kicker is figuring out how the commit message is supposed to look like
Oct 16 21:39:09 <johnjay>	speaking of lines. i should finish that macro chapter you linked
Oct 16 21:39:17 <johnjay>	i wanted to write macros doline, dofile, and dodir
Oct 16 21:39:27 <johnjay>	the utility of which hopefully is apparent from the name
Oct 16 21:39:54 <wasamasa>	not exactly
Oct 16 21:40:00 <bpalmer>	johnjay: I agree it's a huge limiting factor, but note that emacs allows up to 15 lines without any assignment.
Oct 16 21:40:20 <johnjay>	or is there a way to do this with mapcar?
Oct 16 21:40:37 <pjb>	there are mapfiles mapdirectories and dolines in pjb-emacs.el…
Oct 16 21:40:47 <johnjay>	say you want to put ABC at the start of each line. then you'd write something like (dolines (x) (setq x (concat "ABC" x)))
Oct 16 21:40:55 <pjb>	johnjay: ^ and http://github.com/informatimago/emacs
Oct 16 21:41:00 <johnjay>	pjb:!
Oct 16 21:41:15 <wasamasa>	hm, that doesn't exactly seem emacsy
Oct 16 21:41:37 <johnjay>	(defmacro* dolines (start-end &body body)
Oct 16 21:41:40 <johnjay>	  "Executes the body with start-var and end-var bound to the start and the end of each lines of the current buffer in turn."
Oct 16 21:42:11 <johnjay>	no it's a perlism
Oct 16 21:42:24 <pjb>	what can be more emacsy than that? Working directly in the buffer!
Oct 16 21:42:34 <pjb>	And it's written in emacs lisp!
Oct 16 21:42:44 <johnjay>	perl automatically wraps your input in a while(<>) loop so it goes the whole file
Oct 16 21:43:00 <wasamasa>	http://ix.io/2AXJ
Oct 16 21:43:36 <wasamasa>	or maybe drop the save-excursion, it doesn't make much sense anyway once you start editing the buffer
Oct 16 21:43:43 <bpalmer>	johnjay: note that requires certain command-line flags.
Oct 16 21:44:00 <johnjay>	right
Oct 16 21:44:21 <wasamasa>	here's what happens when a freedom-denying person denies your freedom via MELPA: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01048.html
Oct 16 21:44:26 <wasamasa>	- Hey brother... I made here one spectacular Emacs package.
Oct 16 21:44:30 <bpalmer>	wasamasa: I don't see why not, although you might be better off using an (let ((p (point-marker))) (unwind-protect (progn ...) (goto-char p)))
Oct 16 21:44:53 <johnjay>	yes that's the version I wrote as well
Oct 16 21:45:53 <wasamasa>	the closest I've seen to that scenario was someone recommending the tabnine package to someone asking how to auto-complete sentences
Oct 16 21:46:34 <bpalmer>	I've never thought to put on a trenchcoat and hang out in alleys offering my emacs warez 
Oct 16 21:46:45 <johnjay>	probably because you wouldn't make money doing that
Oct 16 21:47:25 <wgreenhouse>	wasamasa: someone should turn those last few lines of that email into a comic
Oct 16 21:47:33 <bpalmer>	I'll lure people in and then hook them on my proprietary substances.
Oct 16 21:48:02 <bpalmer>	at any rate. 
Oct 16 21:50:04 <wasamasa>	lol: https://github.com/codota/TabNine/issues/4
Oct 16 21:50:30 <grym>	"personal hate promotion" is it 
Oct 16 21:51:09 <bpalmer>	but before I go, I'd suggest rather than a setq approach, if you do write such a macro to iterate over and mutate, that it be something like (defmacro* dolines (line-sym &optional replace-sym) ...) so that you can do (dolines (x replace-line) (replace-line (concat "abc: " x))) , where replace-sym defaults to something like replace-line
Oct 16 21:51:47 <bpalmer>	It strikes me as a very unusual interface to treat mutating x as a sign to flush it out; almost ORM-like in hidden behavior.
Oct 16 21:52:59 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: too bad I can only badly imitate existing art
Oct 16 21:53:18 <bpalmer>	although allowing it to be a random symbol means that you might need a codewalker. Hmm.
Oct 16 21:53:22 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: though, maybe we could convince sachac to do it
Oct 16 21:53:45 <bpalmer>	It might be better to just always locally bind replace-line to a function; that way elisp's normal semantics/reader apply.
Oct 16 21:54:04 <pjb>	johnjay: granted, a maplines could be a better idea.  (defun* maplines (fun &optional (buffer (current-buffer))) (let ((result '())) (with-current-buffer buffer (dolines (start end) (push (funcall fun (buffer-substring start end)) result))) result))  (reduce 'max (maplines 'length (current-buffer)) :initial-value 0)  --> 493
Oct 16 21:55:56 <pjb>	bpalmer: but dolines let you use the usual buffer mutation operators.  (dolines (start end)  (goto-char start) (insert "{") (goto-char end) (insert "}")) ; start and end are markers.
Oct 16 21:56:23 <bpalmer>	pjb: I haven't looked at your code, simply johnjay's proposed interface above.
Oct 16 22:05:06 <bpalmer>	And I guess the functional route would be to pass a callback function 
Oct 16 22:07:42 <johnjay>	>I have noticed that some packages like lastpass or helm-lastpass guide users to non-free or proprietary software, thousands of such packages have been downloaded thus putting MELPA users at greater risks.
Oct 16 22:08:33 <johnjay>	pjb: hrm you can't use the buffer functions in a callback with maplines?
Oct 16 22:17:56 <pjb>	johnjay: you could pass start and end as additionnal parameters to the fun.
Oct 16 22:18:32 <wrycode>	IME tabnine provides no major advantage over well-configured dabbrev, capf, etc.
Oct 16 22:19:04 <pjb>	johnjay: my dolines macro leaves the point at the end-of-line, but it doesn't offer this guarantee. You have to use the start and end markers. 
Oct 16 23:00:23 <winny>	hmm seems like occur i missing some nice binds like navigating between entries while not switching buffers or navigating with simply n and p
Oct 16 23:13:12 <johnjay>	winny: i thought you could navigate in it, try C-n and C-p?
Oct 16 23:13:57 <winny>	indeed
Oct 16 23:14:09 <winny>	wondering if anybody recommended a minor mode or alternate occur
Oct 16 23:15:18 <johnjay>	ouch
Oct 16 23:17:40 <johnjay>	weird apparently C-x ` is the command to go to next entry
Oct 16 23:18:52 <johnjay>	i'm not sure why next-error works with occur
Oct 16 23:20:07 <shafox>	I am using (vanilla emacs) lsp-mode with lsp-jedi, how do I know which python it is using for running jedi ? 
Oct 16 23:21:37 <johnjay>	usually python shows its version when you run it. is it running behind the scenes?
Oct 16 23:21:57 <johnjay>	if it's an ongoing process you can do ps -e maybe to find which one
Oct 16 23:22:50 <laertus>	you could probably lsof it too
Oct 16 23:23:48 <laertus>	but probably better than all of these is to find out how lsp-mode or lsp-jedi are calling python.. so then you know how to change that configuration
Oct 16 23:24:36 <laertus>	you may need to search through their docs, configs, or source for that..
Oct 16 23:24:41 <shafox>	johnjay, its running as background process.
Oct 16 23:24:57 <laertus>	oh yeah, something else that might help is M-x list-processes
Oct 16 23:34:41 <mplsCorwin>	Dmitry Gutov.  Nuff said.
Oct 16 23:40:56 <mplsCorwin>	Ok.  Totally *not* crazy.  If you look at the email to the ML one hour back from Drew Adams you will see the super-short fill length I was talking about.
Oct 16 23:41:30 <laertus>	link?
Oct 16 23:41:52 <laertus>	also, i believe you.. i was just saying that i didn't see it in my own correspondence with him
Oct 16 23:41:55 <mplsCorwin>	If I'd had the link handy I woudn't have given the topic name and time frame instead?
Oct 16 23:42:02 <mplsCorwin>	lol nw
Oct 16 23:42:35 <mplsCorwin>	I'll find a link in a little if you are still looking.  Power was down a bunch and it's working out to be a bad hair day for tech.
Oct 16 23:43:06 <laertus>	i was just curious
Oct 16 23:43:19 <laertus>	not worth troubling yourself over it
Oct 16 23:44:15 <mplsCorwin>	laertus: thanks.  sorry about that.  wierd nerves today.  Found it, anyway: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01058.html
Oct 16 23:45:42 <laertus>	that's not 15 columns
Oct 16 23:45:44 <laertus>	looks like 52
Oct 16 23:45:57 <laertus>	(not including the text he quoted
Oct 16 23:46:18 <mplsCorwin>	I'll grant I was being dramaitc
Oct 16 23:46:28 <laertus>	and if i had to guess, he was probably using 52 to try to be compatible with people who have trouble reading wider text
Oct 16 23:46:43 <laertus>	probably a holdover from older days when some such might have actually existed
Oct 16 23:47:38 <bandali>	using shorter fill lengths can be pretty fun :-p https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacsconf-discuss/2019-11/msg00002.html
Oct 16 23:48:09 <bandali>	that was 47
Oct 16 23:48:18 <bandali>	these days i mostly use the standard 72 tho
Oct 16 23:48:32 <laertus>	i need to post a message all in one column
Oct 16 23:49:12 <laertus>	though it'd probably break some mail readers..
Oct 16 23:49:40 <mplsCorwin>	THe ML forcing things to plan text creates an imporant use-case for filling in email since MX will essencially fill the text if we don't this lets us control the display more effectively
Oct 16 23:50:17 <mplsCorwin>	counterpoint being that this is something of a self-created purpose as allowing HTML mails would mean the context would wrap to people's displays.
Oct 16 23:50:57 <mplsCorwin>	Anyway, like I said last night - it's doesn't really bug me, it's just odd.
Oct 16 23:51:45 <laertus>	this reminds me of "format flowed" emails
Oct 16 23:52:07 <laertus>	https://joeclark.org/ffaq.html
Oct 16 23:59:52 <bbuccianti>	how do you read atom feeds?
Oct 17 00:00:40 <laertus>	with an rss reader
Oct 17 00:01:22 <laertus>	i personally use a non-emacs rss reader called newsboat
Oct 17 00:02:07 <laertus>	i've been tempted to try el-feed, but from what i can tell it made some design decisions that i don't like, and i'm not sure how easy it would be to change it to my liking
Oct 17 00:02:38 <laertus>	but a lot of people are very happy with it, so you might want to give it a go
Oct 17 00:03:00 <bbuccianti>	sure thing
Oct 17 00:22:49 <laertus>	in the customize gui, is there any way to get the symbol of the variable at point that's being customized?
Oct 17 00:24:27 <loganlee>	hi
Oct 17 01:00:01 <shafox>	To setup the venvPath in pyright lsp, there is a variable, lsp-pyright-venv-path, I am using poetry to manage env. the path to venv is the result of this "poetry env list --path", how do I set the variable value which is the result of that command  ?

Oct 17 01:53:49 <ryouma>	something on emacs-devel?
Oct 17 01:54:08 <mplsCorwin>	ryouma: are you seriously asking?  There are a dozen links shared and conversations had in channel -- yes, about emacs-devel -- daily.
Oct 17 01:54:47 <mplsCorwin>	ryouma: sorry for tone there.  Not quite sure what's been up with me today.  I do believe I should log for a bit.
Oct 17 01:54:52 <ryouma>	i am most of the time out of the loop
Oct 17 01:55:04 <ryouma>	i logged into channel just recently
Oct 17 01:55:28 <grym>	mplsCorwin: can i interest you in this fine pamphlet about "bicycling until the internet stops mattering for a minute"
Oct 17 01:55:29 <mplsCorwin>	ryouma: I already think of u as a regular tho :)
Oct 17 01:55:55 <mplsCorwin>	grym: do you have an audiobook of that?  I gotta do a thing..
Oct 17 01:56:11 <grym>	mplsCorwin: it is, sadly, a fictitious pamphlet 
Oct 17 01:56:25 <mplsCorwin>	iknowiknow
Oct 17 01:56:27 <grym>	the audiobook version of cryptonomicon, though, is very good 
Oct 17 01:56:38 <ryouma>	mplsCorwin: i frequently log into the channel but do not always stay lgged in or log in
Oct 17 01:56:56 <bpalmer>	ryouma: there is a current thread in emacs-devel , with original subject "Proposal for an Emacs User Survey", which has gotten a fair amount of attention in the channel, particularly with regards to whether any such survey should acknowledge the existence of MELPA
Oct 17 01:57:14 <grym>	"bikeshedding, with _knives_"
Oct 17 01:57:21 <bpalmer>	ryouma: And, if it does acknowledge it, whether it should be denounced.
Oct 17 01:57:28 <ryouma>	ah thanks for overview
Oct 17 01:57:37 <grym>	(is my halfassed tl;dr as at this point i now i think actively want to never be on that mailing list)
Oct 17 01:58:20 <mplsCorwin>	Today's installment feature various messages discussing the disregard in which redditers at large are ascribed for RMS.
Oct 17 01:58:24 <slondr>	grym: I hadn't seen that, hahah
Oct 17 01:58:47 <bpalmer>	grym: is it , though? I tried getting through The Fall, which is a sequel of sorts of Cryptonomicon, and I think I'm steadily growing less enchanted with Stephenson's more technothriller/literary works
Oct 17 01:58:55 <mplsCorwin>	ok.  I really am logging.  I can grammar longer not.
Oct 17 01:59:07 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, on emacs-devel?
Oct 17 01:59:09 <ryouma>	i stopped partway throuhgh the system of the world
Oct 17 01:59:13 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: yes.
Oct 17 01:59:37 <bandali>	i plan to (try to, at least) catch up with my ~2k backlog of it this weekend :-p
Oct 17 01:59:37 <ryouma>	so this is worse than the `' thread?
Oct 17 02:00:00 <bpalmer>	oh, the smart quotes one. That, too, was "fun."
Oct 17 02:00:04 <ryouma>	i guess i shouldn't have asked that.  that probably wasn't acrimonous.
Oct 17 02:00:45 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: it would absolutely nuts for you to try to catch up on the ML now.
Oct 17 02:00:53 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: and I say that with love.
Oct 17 02:01:39 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, ahaha :-p
Oct 17 02:01:43 <bandali>	i mean i kinda agree
Oct 17 02:01:44 <grym>	bpalmer: seveneves and the fall were kind of meh 
Oct 17 02:01:50 <bandali>	i'm not gonna be reading every single message
Oct 17 02:02:00 <bandali>	mostly skimming / breezing through them with the help of gnus
Oct 17 02:02:07 <bandali>	and only read through (some of) the most interesting ones
Oct 17 02:02:12 <bandali>	and flagging a bunch for later
Oct 17 02:02:22 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: I've been racking my brains how to use all the energy around this in some positive way for Emacsconf.  Frank conversation, roundtable sort of thing.  Everything I can think seems like it quite likely would be terrible
Oct 17 02:02:48 <grym>	mplsCorwin: zoom boffers just don't work 
Oct 17 02:03:45 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, ha! if you have any ideas, please, don't hesitate to write to emacsconf-discuss and/or emacsconf-org, or even better, add them to https://emacsconf.org/2020/ideas/ or https://emacsconf.org/2020/planning/
Oct 17 02:03:50 <bandali>	i'd very much appreciate that
Oct 17 02:03:54 <bpalmer>	grym: seveneves I'm torn on. First, it was two different stories: a novel followed by a novella. I threw the book aside when it got to the novella at the end.
Oct 17 02:04:11 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: *two thumbs up*
Oct 17 02:04:20 <bpalmer>	grym: But the novel had some absolutely fantastic parts and it still drifts into my mind every few months.
Oct 17 02:04:32 <grym>	bpalmer: i finished it, but i kept waiting for jad to show up 
Oct 17 02:04:40 <bpalmer>	jad?
Oct 17 02:04:40 <fsbot>	jad is the fast Java decompiler at http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html
Oct 17 02:04:49 <grym>	bpalmer: the thousander from Anathem 
Oct 17 02:05:06 <bpalmer>	Ah. I liked Anathem, but very little of it has stuck with me.
Oct 17 02:05:29 <grym>	bpalmer: it's way high up on my list. 
Oct 17 02:05:54 <grym>	the fall was getting a bit close to heinlein writing himself into his own multiverse
Oct 17 02:06:31 <grym>	bpalmer: you do have to give the novella section the benefit of the most absurd Stephenson Name, which is a high accomplishment 
Oct 17 02:06:43 <bpalmer>	oh, what is it?
Oct 17 02:06:48 <grym>	Sonar Taxlaw
Oct 17 02:06:58 <bpalmer>	...
Oct 17 02:07:14 <grym>	she's named after the piece of the encyclopedia her family line was entrusted with memorizing! :) 
Oct 17 02:08:15 <bpalmer>	That's something, all right.
Oct 17 02:08:33 <grym>	i am at least somewhat convinced he has that plotline there just for the name 
Oct 17 02:09:39 <bpalmer>	Maybe I'll be able to dip in and read that section now; at the time I was just so angry that he'd splice a story in like that.
Oct 17 02:11:27 <grym>	i have a real thin background in grownup physics, so i was able to read the first bits easily in the sense that i wasn't fretting about errors.  but i know the biotech side of things reasonably well, and so the epigenetics mechanic is harder to read seriously 
Oct 17 02:12:03 <grym>	it makes sense because he did that research in 2006-7, and extrapolated fine, its just that in the time it took to get the book published the science didn't bear that trajectory out 
Oct 17 02:20:46 <aidalgol>	Moooom! The reactionaries are leaking into my YouTube recommendations again!
Oct 17 02:21:00 <aidalgol>	"The Karen's, The SJW's, the posers, the political provocateur's, and their doormen Bad Robot all want a piece of Lord of the Rings on Prime and with all this come some rumors that aren't surprising leaving us with questions."
Oct 17 02:21:01 <aidalgol>	wut?
Oct 17 02:22:02 <bpalmer>	What is the entity possessed by Karens? Is it the same as that possessed by the provocateurs?
Oct 17 02:23:01 <aidalgol>	Um...  Can I phone a friend?
Oct 17 02:23:08 <aidalgol>	No, wait, ask the audience!
Oct 17 02:23:24 <grym>	,yow
Oct 17 02:23:25 <fsbot>	I'm RELIGIOUS!!  I love a man with a HAIRPIECE!!  Equip me with MISSILES!!
Oct 17 02:23:36 <grym>	let's do what the madman says
Oct 17 02:26:24 <bpalmer>	rudybot: missiles are outdated when rocks can be dropped from orbital platforms.
Oct 17 02:26:27 <rudybot>	bpalmer: "Orbital fucking missiles?!!"
Oct 17 02:26:43 <grym>	bpalmer: into volcanoes
Oct 17 02:27:05 <bpalmer>	hold on, here. LOTR would be very different if you had that sort of intercontinental ballistic capability.
Oct 17 02:27:46 <aidalgol>	bpalmer: That was the main plot device in one of the Call of Duty games.
Oct 17 02:28:03 <grym>	bpalmer: i meant anathem,
Oct 17 02:34:20 <bpalmer>	rudybot: has anybody established how many knots a giant eagle can do with a top gun nazgul on its tail?
Oct 17 02:34:26 <rudybot>	bpalmer: Quando c'era Sauron, i Nazgul partivano in orario.
Oct 17 02:36:43 <bpalmer>	rudybot: I assume the ainur could teach top-notch dog-fighting skills at the academy, and hand out lenses to those Tellurians deserving of one.
Oct 17 02:36:46 <rudybot>	bpalmer: The ainur were literally created to be musicians. I am doubtful of this chronology
Oct 17 02:36:50 <ryouma>	mm you can add advice to a function before that function is loaded, without getting any warnings or errors.  i /think/ that is good.
Oct 17 02:37:19 <bpalmer>	grym: clearly, I need to re-read.
Oct 17 02:37:53 <bpalmer>	I'll put it at the bottom of my pile, so I'll get to it in. hmm. This is supposed to be a finite collection, isn't it?
Oct 17 02:38:34 <grym>	bpalmer: much more than some other authors i can name, at least the man doesn't write neverending series
Oct 17 02:39:05 <grym>	cough cough grrm sanderson jordan rothfuss
Oct 17 02:39:23 <bpalmer>	rothfuss's series has rather ended, it seems.
Oct 17 02:39:32 <grym>	a shame.  good magic system 
Oct 17 02:40:13 <bpalmer>	And Sanderson ... well, he's actually quite prolific. If he weren't intent on this terrible, terrible interlinked world system, I'd actually cite him as a counterexample.
Oct 17 02:40:20 <grym>	speaking of good magic systems and trilogies, the audiobook versions of the garth nix books are done by tim curry :) 
Oct 17 02:40:30 <bpalmer>	wow.
Oct 17 02:40:45 <bpalmer>	(There are 4 books in the Sabriel series now, btw)
Oct 17 02:40:49 <grym>	he does a mean mogget
Oct 17 02:40:57 <grym>	5, i think 
Oct 17 02:41:02 <bpalmer>	5
Oct 17 02:41:04 <bpalmer>	You're right.
Oct 17 02:41:14 <grym>	but the core 3 are enough for me.  clariel was good though
Oct 17 02:41:56 <bpalmer>	I wasn't a big fan of Goldenhand.
Oct 17 02:42:03 <bpalmer>	Definitely felt extra.
Oct 17 02:42:27 <grym>	yeah that's what i heard; i haven't bothered to read it as a result 
Oct 17 02:43:18 <bpalmer>	As for Rothfuss: while he may yet write his third book, the time it has taken has let me re-read the other books in the world, and allowed me to see some truly self-indulgent bits.
Oct 17 02:43:45 <grym>	yeah.  i feel that way a lot about scott lynch 
Oct 17 02:43:52 <grym>	who i found about the same time as rothfuss
Oct 17 02:45:55 <wrycode>	mbrumlow: heads up I think your ssl certs are old
Oct 17 02:46:24 <grym>	the first book was good, the second was okay, and by book three it was pretty clear that we were in "scott lynch is processing his divorce by writing a book"
Oct 17 02:47:14 <grym>	or do i have this completely wrong? i expect to be schooled by someone else here in short order :P
Oct 17 02:47:43 <grym>	ah, no, i was right
Oct 17 02:48:05 <bpalmer>	I don't know much about Lynch's background. I have only read books 1 and 3 and thought each were good with something a litle lacking, so they weren't quite as good as I would have expected.
Oct 17 02:48:40 <bpalmer>	I think it was mostly tied to structural elements of the flashback and ongoing plot.
Oct 17 02:50:32 <bpalmer>	But the Dresden Files, that seems to be the consensus for how some aspects of the book series are done: Jim Butcher apparently talked about getting into weightlifting, and all of a sudden workouts started showing up 
Oct 17 02:51:24 <grym>	hah
Oct 17 02:51:32 <grym>	i read the first ~4 or so 
Oct 17 02:51:42 <grym>	apparently there's a lot now 
Oct 17 02:52:54 <bpalmer>	Yes. 17 books in the series; a definite mixed bag where some are good and many are uneven.
Oct 17 02:58:45 <grym>	that's a bunch, yep 
Oct 17 03:02:55 <bpalmer>	I just bought a humble bundle of books by R.A. Salvatore last week; apparently the multiple series featuring his character Drizzt Do'Urden is up to the 30s now
Oct 17 03:04:38 <grym>	i was always more forgotten realms than dragonlance
Oct 17 03:04:45 <grym>	friggin' mopey emo mages
Oct 17 03:05:23 <bpalmer>	Drizzt is set in the Forgotten Realms
Oct 17 03:05:59 <grym>	yep
Oct 17 03:06:07 <grym>	i read a few of them, long ago 
Oct 17 03:12:11 <wrycode>	I used to love the legend of drizzt
Oct 17 03:12:35 <wrycode>	30 books? jesus
Oct 17 03:12:57 <grym>	those scimitars just can't get enough 
Oct 17 03:16:42 <bpalmer>	rudybot: once you start your campaign, you may discover you're locked in for life.
Oct 17 03:16:46 <rudybot>	bpalmer: is pleasantly surprised to discover (accidentally) that some of the Bernie Sanders campaign organization's bespoke software is AGPLed
Oct 17 03:55:54 <dannylee>	thor might be Jesus real father
Oct 17 03:56:32 <dannylee>	i'm just out of emacs question
Oct 17 04:10:40 <bpalmer>	rudybot: i'm here to chew bubblegum and walk, and I can't do both at the same time.
Oct 17 04:10:44 <rudybot>	bpalmer: stupid babies... can't even walk and chew bubblegum at the same time
Oct 17 04:18:55 <elisper>	Anyone know how I can change my slime-completion so that it makes a drop-down, instead of a new buffer, the way it does here? https://github.com/anwyn/slime-company/blob/master/slime-company.png
Oct 17 04:33:39 <laertus>	from elisp, how do i open an info buffer to an info topic that's *not* part of the emacs nor elisp info manual?
Oct 17 04:34:29 <ryouma>	laertus: you make sure those are on your system or you set the info path
Oct 17 04:34:35 <ryouma>	the top level is info manuals
Oct 17 04:34:37 <ryouma>	c-h i
Oct 17 04:34:52 <laertus>	they are in my info manuals
Oct 17 04:35:02 <laertus>	but i'm looking to get to a particular one from elisp
Oct 17 04:35:17 <laertus>	not through interactive use of emacs
Oct 17 04:36:08 <laertus>	i can already get to it through interactive use, so i know emacs has access to it
Oct 17 04:36:10 <ryouma>	(info "Bash")
Oct 17 04:36:15 <laertus>	ok, thanks
Oct 17 04:39:02 <laertus>	and for something a bit tricker...
Oct 17 04:39:33 <laertus>	any way to check for the existence and acessibility to emacs of a particular info manual?
Oct 17 04:39:49 <laertus>	i'd like to do something like (infop "Bash")
Oct 17 04:40:57 <ryouma>	,utsl
Oct 17 04:40:58 <laertus>	hmm.. i guess i could wrap a condition-case around (info "Bash")
Oct 17 04:40:58 <fsbot>	UTSL is [0] an abbreviation for Use The Source, Luke!
Oct 17 04:40:59 <fsbot>	[1] an alternative to rtfm when there is no fm to r.
Oct 17 04:40:59 <fsbot>	[2] "When I want to understand what is happening today or try to decide what will happen tomorrow, I look at the source code." -- Omar Khayyám
Oct 17 04:41:26 <ryouma>	that is what i did to answer your question
Oct 17 04:41:59 <ryouma>	it surely looks for it so it will have code that looks for it so you can find that code so you will have your answer
Oct 17 04:42:16 *	laertus nods
Oct 17 04:42:19 <laertus>	thanks
Oct 17 05:26:55 <bpalmer>	rudybot: the clock draws near to midnight; are you prepared to repent before it's too late?
Oct 17 05:27:10 <rudybot>	bpalmer: I call upon rudybot to repent
Oct 17 05:40:00 <aidalgol>	What are the downsides to wildcart SSL certs?
Oct 17 05:40:16 <sam_>	expensive
Oct 17 05:40:23 <aidalgol>	sam_: how?
Oct 17 05:40:24 <sam_>	you could argue it's "eggs in one basket"
Oct 17 05:40:39 <sam_>	I mean, practically, at least last time I checked, you had to pay a ridiculous amount to a CA for one
Oct 17 05:40:45 <sam_>	maybe LE offers them now
Oct 17 05:40:51 <sam_>	they're not technically expensive
Oct 17 05:41:00 <aidalgol>	ah
Oct 17 05:41:06 <aidalgol>	I mean aside from economics.
Oct 17 06:03:12 <pjb>	hi! So, with (emacs-version) --> "GNU Emacs 27.1 (build 1, x86_64-apple-darwin18.7.0, NS appkit-1671.60 Version 10.14.6 (Build 18G95)) of 2020-08-12", when I try to use a customization variable, eg. erc-autojoin-channels-alist  with eval-last-sexp, it gives (mapcar 'erc-join-channel (cdr (assoc "freenode.org" erc-autojoin-channels-alist))) -> Lisp error: (void-variable erc-autojoin-channels-alist)
Oct 17 06:03:18 <pjb>	how do we access customization variables now?
Oct 17 06:03:25 <pjb>	Why this incompatible change?
Oct 17 06:04:40 <mplsCorwin>	Hrm.  I didn't have to update erc-autojoin-channel-alist conf when I went fromn 26.3 to 27.1, that I recall..
Oct 17 06:06:13 <mplsCorwin>	pjb: what happens when you M-x customize-variable RET erc-autojoin-channels-alist RET ?
Oct 17 06:06:27 <bpalmer>	pjb: sounds like you haven't loaded the library that defvars/defcustoms it.
Oct 17 06:07:22 <bpalmer>	pjb: or, what is the top-level form you're trying to eval ?
Oct 17 06:07:30 <bpalmer>	custom-set-variable?
Oct 17 06:07:40 <bpalmer>	customize-set-variable, rather, or custom-set-variables ?
Oct 17 06:07:50 <pjb>	Yes, I set it with custom-set-variables
Oct 17 06:08:03 <pjb>	(and a ton of others. I'd have to require a lot of files…)
Oct 17 06:09:08 <bpalmer>	pjb: you don't need to require them if you set the variable absolutely without trying to read it.
Oct 17 06:09:17 <pjb>	So how we have to require stuff in each buffer where we use a custom variable…
Oct 17 06:09:29 <bpalmer>	no, only if you try to *read* the variable, when it's not set.
Oct 17 06:09:34 <pjb>	This wil break a lot of commands.
Oct 17 06:09:49 <pjb>	It's set, since I customize it in my rc files.
Oct 17 06:10:00 <pjb>	And also I try to evaluate it in a erc-mode buffer…
Oct 17 06:10:12 <bpalmer>	pjb: is erc-autojoin in the erc-modules list?
Oct 17 06:10:53 <bpalmer>	but, unless there's some very serious bug, i suspect something is failing to set it and the module is also not being loaded.
Oct 17 06:11:08 <pjb>	No, I removed it, because I want to autojoin manually…
Oct 17 06:11:51 <bpalmer>	pjb: you need to load the library to have the variables it defines; having it in the erc-modules list has a side effect of loading it as well as activating it.
Oct 17 06:12:01 <pjb>	So I guess I have to load erc-autojoin, without adding it to erc-modules so that autojoin is not done, but I can access it. Ok. Thanks.
Oct 17 06:12:49 <pjb>	Let's see if it works.
Oct 17 06:23:56 <pjb>	Didn't work. Well, after all I don't want to autojoin, so I will use my own variable. There's no reason to use that erc customization variable…
Oct 17 06:25:41 <mplsCorwin>	I wonder if this is a case for eval-after-load, as in (eval-after-load 'erc-autojoin-mode (setq ...))
Oct 17 06:31:17 <pjb>	When I try to follow a doc link to C sources of emacs, it asks me for the directory of emacs sources, but I have set source-directory in my rc file. with (setq source-directory (format "/usr/local/src/emacs-%s/src" emacs-version))
Oct 17 07:00:13 <buhman>	I just started reading LFN and my mind is completely blown away by this black magic: https://gist.github.com/buhman/a856392c5b772564797d8585961d45dc (a lisp-1 interpreter written in lisp-1, with trivial glue to in turn port the interpreter to scheme)
Oct 17 07:08:02 <pjb>	buhman: don't worry, Dijkstra ever could understand lisp either.  
Oct 17 07:08:09 <pjb>	buhman: but this xeval is the core of lisp.
Oct 17 07:08:22 <pjb>	buhman: lisp is defined by an evaluation function written in lisp itself.
Oct 17 07:08:54 <pjb>	buhman: this means that introspection and reflexivity is built in the core of lisp.
Oct 17 07:09:15 <pjb>	externally, this shows by the fact that lisp programs are not written as code, but as data.
Oct 17 07:09:33 <pjb>	buhman: the syntax of sexp, is a syntax for DATA. Symbolic Expressions are data.
Oct 17 07:10:09 <pjb>	buhman: so this xeval function can take some data, a sexp, that represents a lisp form, some code. But since it's data, it can process it and interpret it.
Oct 17 07:10:28 <pjb>	buhman: now the thing is that this xeval is expressed as a sexp too in this file!
Oct 17 07:10:40 <pjb>	buhman: so we need something to bootstrap the system.
Oct 17 07:11:12 <buhman>	yeah, quite cool there's no parsing involved; xeval is effectivenly being passed a pre-parsed ast.
Oct 17 07:11:13 <pjb>	buhman: Russel, a student of McCarthy showed that it could be written as a "simple" 7090 assembler program. It was LISP 1.
Oct 17 07:11:27 <pjb>	buhman: but of course, you can also use a lisp (scheme) to bootstrap it too.
Oct 17 07:11:29 <buhman>	super excited to read the rest of this, for the bootstrapping stuff too
Oct 17 07:11:44 <pjb>	buhman: well, it's not exactly an AST, but close enough.
Oct 17 07:12:16 <pjb>	buhman: there's sometimes some "syntax" inside the sexps, that can be "parsed".
Oct 17 07:12:43 <buhman>	you mean, if the interpreter implemented macros?
Oct 17 07:12:55 <pjb>	For example.
Oct 17 07:13:35 <pjb>	This is because we write data that we need this QUOTE operator, to tell xeval that we have here a sexp literal, instead of a sexp that represents code to be interpreted.
Oct 17 07:14:25 <pjb>	McCarthy originally planed to have M-expressions for the code.  car([A,B,C]) -> A  instead of (CAR (QUOTE (A B C))).
Oct 17 07:14:42 <pjb>	Have a look at http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/m-expression/index.html
Oct 17 07:15:31 <pjb>	This didn't add anything. Using sexps was simplier, and once we have macros (invented in 1964), (and before that there was already fexprs), it locked in the sexps.
Oct 17 07:39:25 <johnjay>	pjb: but what about that old thing from lisp machines where it used proper names
Oct 17 07:39:37 <johnjay>	like instead of this-is-a-function it was M-x This Is A Function <RET>
Oct 17 07:39:48 <johnjay>	i'm sure i saw that in a video demo
Oct 17 07:42:30 <mplsCorwin>	could be done just with an overlay in M-:, I'd think
Oct 17 07:42:36 <mplsCorwin>	oops, M-x
Oct 17 07:43:13 <pjb>	johnjay: this is something you can do in emacs too. (all emacsen I know too).
Oct 17 07:44:11 <pjb>	johnjay: but indeed, early sexps used the comma to separate atoms, not the space, Hence in my example, car[(A,B,C)] (I interchanged () with []).
Oct 17 07:44:27 <pjb>	Because it was (ONE SYMBOL,ANOTHER SYMBOL,A THIRD SYMBOL)
Oct 17 07:44:56 <pjb>	But in the first implementation of LISP, it was already  (ONE-SYMBOL ANOTHER-SYMBOL A-THIRD-SYMBOL)
Oct 17 07:45:40 <pjb>	I don't know if the possibility to enter commands with spaces in emacsen comes from that, I doubt it. It probably come from the same ergonomic and user-friendly reasons.
Oct 17 07:46:31 <pjb>	That said if you type a space in M-x it actually just completes the text, and inserts dashes, instead of a space.
Oct 17 07:46:50 <pjb>	but Zwei and Hemlock explicitely define commands using strings with spaces.
Oct 17 07:46:59 <mplsCorwin>	I wonder if there's already an option to give "Friendly Caps" and hide the spaces, e.g. with an overlay.
Oct 17 07:47:36 <pjb>	mplsCorwin: M-x whitespace-mode RET ?
Oct 17 07:49:49 <johnjay>	oh yeah it was zweo
Oct 17 07:49:51 <mplsCorwin>	Sorta the exact opposite of that? ;)
Oct 17 07:49:55 <johnjay>	er zwei
Oct 17 07:52:46 <pjb>	mplsCorwin: C-- M-x whitespace-mode RET ?
Oct 17 07:53:01 <pjb>	Or C-u - M-x whitespace-mode RET 
Oct 17 07:55:43 <mplsCorwin>	pjb: :)  I'm good to toggle the mode.  I was thinking that it might be interesting to have M-x *show* Camel Case with hyphens presented as space.
Oct 17 07:56:16 <pjb>	Oh, I see. 
Oct 17 07:56:25 <pjb>	Yes, you could do that with compose-region.
Oct 17 07:56:37 <pjb>	and font-lock-keywords.
Oct 17 07:56:49 <mplsCorwin>	could you, then ;)
Oct 17 07:57:16 <mplsCorwin>	In fact, we could change the prompt from the cryptic M-x to "Enter Command:".
Oct 17 07:58:09 <mplsCorwin>	No idea if that's actually less intimating for anyone.
Oct 17 07:59:36 <mplsCorwin>	pjb: if you seriously think that's easy, and also think some people would want it, would you be interested to try making a POC patch or something?
Oct 17 07:59:51 <mplsCorwin>	GO screw yourself is a perfectly fair answer :)
Oct 17 08:03:55 <kudahtor228>	are there any devops channels?
Oct 17 08:04:40 <wasamasa>	/msg alis list devops
Oct 17 08:05:33 <kudahtor228>	thanks
Oct 17 08:06:31 <wasamasa>	I guess MELPA isn't interested in becoming spokespeople for GNU and their free software policies
Oct 17 08:06:52 <mplsCorwin>	Are you quoting Jean, by chance?
Oct 17 08:07:15 <wasamasa>	Jean is involved: https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/7185
Oct 17 08:07:37 <wasamasa>	played out exactly as I've expected
Oct 17 08:08:20 <mplsCorwin>	There's really nothing about that which isn't dissapointing.
Oct 17 08:08:36 <wasamasa>	"This would be infighting" - "Let's see whether they change for the sake of the greater good" - "Great, you've intensified the infighting!" - "If they're truly good, they'll change for our sake"
Oct 17 08:08:43 <wasamasa>	surprise, they won't
Oct 17 08:09:06 <mplsCorwin>	> To be clear, it seems that @gnusupport is "Jean Louis," a frequent, strongly opinionated poster on the Emacs mailing list
Oct 17 08:09:23 <wasamasa>	I was surprised to learn though that it's supposed to be support.gnu which makes a lot more sense
Oct 17 08:09:59 <mplsCorwin>	yeah, that'd read quite a bit better.
Oct 17 08:11:04 <pjb>	mplsCorwin: it's easy enough. It may be costly because you have to build a character/composition rule vector for each symbol, but the composition rules allow the juxtaposition of characters, so possible…
Oct 17 08:11:42 <wasamasa>	later Jean conflates freedom and security which is, wow
Oct 17 08:12:09 <wasamasa>	and doesn't like #emacs either :D
Oct 17 08:12:14 <mplsCorwin>	pjb: it strikes me that should be acceptable given this is implicitly a interactive, user-attention demanding thing, and probably said user's fingers the bottlenecks. wdyt?
Oct 17 08:12:34 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: this is the point I've been stewing on, yes.
Oct 17 08:15:11 <mplsCorwin>	"please assume good faith"
Oct 17 08:15:54 <wasamasa>	at least this made RMS spell out what exactly MELPA needs to do to be mentionable in surveys without denunciation: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01074.html
Oct 17 08:16:16 <wasamasa>	I don't see that happen either though
Oct 17 08:16:46 <wasamasa>	if they won't delete packages wrapping software considered unethical, they won't do away with github's preferred workflow either
Oct 17 08:16:57 <buhman>	"why we must not inform people about MELPA" ... wat
Oct 17 08:17:09 <wasamasa>	he hopes it's not widely known
Oct 17 08:17:20 <wasamasa>	but just in case it is, https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01083.html
Oct 17 08:17:30 <mplsCorwin>	Maybe it's too bad Jean didn't let things play out.
Oct 17 08:17:46 <buhman>	uhh, I thought everyone used melpa
Oct 17 08:18:01 <wasamasa>	freedom-abiding citizens wouldn't
Oct 17 08:18:17 <mplsCorwin>	buhman: true, and papa ain't happy.
Oct 17 08:18:19 <wasamasa>	just as they won't use debian because it has the audacity of coming with a non-free repository and instructions how to use it
Oct 17 08:18:47 <wasamasa>	to the effect of "If you're having wifi issues, consider installing firmware from the non-free repo as follows"
Oct 17 08:19:01 <wasamasa>	this is considered inacceptable by true GNU adherents
Oct 17 08:19:26 <mplsCorwin>	"Please use less of your computer while volunteers reverse engineer an ever growing amarda of hardware" doesn't feel like a real plan to win the hearts and minds.
Oct 17 08:19:41 <mplsCorwin>	armada*
Oct 17 08:19:44 <buhman>	doesn't torvalds/linux include "something something nonfree firmware" somewhere in /Documentation ?
Oct 17 08:19:56 <buhman>	why does linux get a pass?
Oct 17 08:20:01 <wasamasa>	doesn't matter if it's excised by FSF-endorsed distros
Oct 17 08:20:32 <wasamasa>	you see, as long as you remove parts threatening your freedoms while loudly denunciating them, you're in the clear
Oct 17 08:20:50 <pjb>	mplsCorwin: however, editing a buffer full of multi-letter composition is difficult.  It would be better to write a reader macro to read whitespaced camel-case symbols as lisp symbols.
Oct 17 08:22:02 <mplsCorwin>	pjb: what about completion? Wouldn't that become somewhat brittle?
Oct 17 08:22:27 <pjb>	Of course it could have wide repercutions.
Oct 17 08:22:48 <wasamasa>	buhman: anyway, the point is there's freedom (you can do whatever you want and share it for whatever reason) and freedom (you must bring freedom to as many as possible while ensuring it cannot be subverted by someone else, yourself not included)
Oct 17 08:22:49 <pjb>	But why would you want it anyways, everybody knows that camel-case is horrible and the right way is the lisp-case.
Oct 17 08:23:11 <mplsCorwin>	that is an exceptionally valid point
Oct 17 08:23:47 <wasamasa>	perhaps libredom is the better term for the latter (libre, domination)
Oct 17 08:24:03 <buhman>	"If we KNEW that almost all users of Emacs did know about Melpa, that would change our policy towards it." what does this even mean?
Oct 17 08:24:19 <wasamasa>	if a non-free thing is mostly unknown, ignore it
Oct 17 08:24:29 <wasamasa>	if a non-free thing is widely known, mention it casually
Oct 17 08:25:07 <buhman>	oh, I didn't realize "policy" referred to "the policy for under what circumstances we publicly denounce something".
Oct 17 08:25:08 <wasamasa>	the problem with that approach is being unaware of your surroundings until you fall into a hole because you didn't pay attention to them
Oct 17 08:25:58 <buhman>	I thought "policy" meant "the policy to decide whether a given sitation is blessed by The Church"
Oct 17 08:26:19 <wasamasa>	see https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/References.html#References for a treatise
Oct 17 08:26:30 <wasamasa>	> If a non-free program or system is obscure in your program’s domain, your program should not mention or support it at all, since doing so would tend to popularize the non-free program more than it popularizes your program.
Oct 17 08:26:41 <wasamasa>	> When a non-free program or system is well known, you can mention it in passing—that is harmless, since users who might want to use it probably already know about it.
Oct 17 08:27:52 <wasamasa>	anyway, not all is bad about emacs-devel
Oct 17 08:28:02 <wasamasa>	for example there's this fun demo: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01086.html
Oct 17 08:28:09 <mplsCorwin>	We are in such a hole.  Proprietary platforms dominate except in the consumer spaces that are dominated by corporate.  This is particularly true in the case of mobile, where our entire tool-chain (the one where we rightly expect to know what's going on within the device) runs the risk of being, basically, a toy running in a VM.
Oct 17 08:29:18 <mplsCorwin>	Worse, we are at a cross-roads in terms of civilly and faithfully carrying on the conversation, as evidenced by AP basically calling J out on those grounds.
Oct 17 08:31:00 <mplsCorwin>	But I think there's some good news, too.  Free software is pretty well known to be at the forefront of our pulling of a major coup of surviving a mass-migration to work-from-home.  We're not zoom, but all nerds talk about open source even if they don't appreciate FLOSS.
Oct 17 08:31:18 <mplsCorwin>	And I think a plurality do appreciate FLOSS.
Oct 17 08:31:41 <mplsCorwin>	But probably not enough to get radically less done during our precious lives.
Oct 17 08:31:46 <wasamasa>	I appreciate FLOSS, but I don't appreciate the infighting
Oct 17 08:31:59 <mplsCorwin>	100%
Oct 17 08:32:10 <mplsCorwin>	We fail to face that, we are screwed.
Oct 17 08:32:19 <kudahtor228>	You can simplify it to "more good practices applied >> finer you do"
Oct 17 08:32:24 <wasamasa>	and honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the result of this is something like debian happening in response
Oct 17 08:33:49 <mplsCorwin>	./insert-shrug
Oct 17 08:34:11 <mplsCorwin>	not uncaring, I just haven't the foggiest.  I can't seem past the moment.
Oct 17 08:34:23 <mplsCorwin>	s/eem/ee
Oct 17 08:35:52 <ryouma>	rt.live has its sources on github fwiw
Oct 17 08:37:28 <wasamasa>	actually, my emacs-devel org file has a previous statement on RMS not believing MELPA is popular: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2014-09/msg00526.html
Oct 17 08:37:41 <wasamasa>	would be fun if I could find enough of them to complete the grief cycle
Oct 17 08:39:41 <mplsCorwin>	┏━┓┏━┓┏━┓ ︵ /(^.^/)
Oct 17 08:41:00 <mplsCorwin>	le sigh.  I got nuthin.  But I've been writing about this so eventually I shall have *lots* of nothing to say about this.
Oct 17 08:41:24 <ryouma>	is the discussion on a specific decision that makes a huge difference?  or is the problem that it is disappointing regardless of what it is on?
Oct 17 08:42:04 <mplsCorwin>	So today's development in the on-going saga of trash talking MELPA on E-D, vs trashing talking E-D/RMS on Reddit, here, is..
Oct 17 08:42:28 <mplsCorwin>	<wasamasa> Jean is involved: https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/7185
Oct 17 08:42:57 <mplsCorwin>	The homework for which was this: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01015.html
Oct 17 08:43:15 <mplsCorwin>	But honestly, screw all that.  Read this: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01041.html
Oct 17 08:44:29 <mplsCorwin>	And then we've been around the room on that the problem is (a) epic (b) about behavior as much as anything
Oct 17 08:45:39 <mplsCorwin>	Full disclosure.  Poor spelling, that's me.  I'ma sack.  Thanks all. Night wasamasa 
Oct 17 08:49:44 <wasamasa>	good night
Oct 17 08:50:00 <wasamasa>	time to break some eggs and play CTF
Oct 17 09:13:43 <buhman>	yeah, why does emacs have Windows and OSX support anyway? isn't that sacrilege?
Oct 17 09:15:29 <pjb>	buhman: because it's free software, so users were free to patch it to make it work on those platforms.
Oct 17 09:16:27 <buhman>	doesn't the source code of emacs as distributed on gnu.org contain that code though?
Oct 17 09:16:47 <pjb>	this has been done a long time ago.
Oct 17 09:18:10 <buhman>	seems like according to the arguments on this thread, emacs itself is in violation of fsf policies.
Oct 17 09:20:36 <aidalgol>	mplsCorwin: As I've been saying for years, the thing e-d is best at is tarpitting itself.
Oct 17 09:26:08 <wasamasa>	buhman: read the references page again, they explain this
Oct 17 09:26:42 <wasamasa>	buhman: it's all about promoting free software ultimately, so as long as you don't go overboard with support of a non-free platform by implementing exclusive things there that don't work on free platforms, it's all good
Oct 17 09:27:03 <wasamasa>	buhman: which happened with color emoji on macos some time ago
Oct 17 09:27:12 <wasamasa>	buhman: as soon as that worked on linux, it got reenabled
Oct 17 09:30:30 <aidalgol>	buhman: Real FSF policy is to stroke certain egos
Oct 17 09:32:00 <wasamasa>	if this reminds you of a specific monty python sketch, you're not alone
Oct 17 09:54:52 <zeroed>	 /w 11
Oct 17 09:56:12 <wasamasa>	could someone with a twitter account please tell https://twitter.com/holocronweaver that the wikemacs certificate has expired more than a year ago?
Oct 17 09:56:12 *	zeroed apologies for typing random characters
Oct 17 09:56:25 <wasamasa>	I mean, I doubt anyone gives a shit really, but it's linked rather prominently on r/emacs
Oct 17 10:17:11 <ksynwa>	Not entirely related to emacs but I have a bunch of essays as *.org file. The files are hard wrapped. If I want to search for a term like "The Selfish Gene", how can I take into account the fact that it might occur as "The Selfish\nGene" at some places? Any tools like grep, ripgrep, etc. suggestions are fine too.
Oct 17 10:23:59 <thblt>	ksynwa: In my Emacs, C-s works accross line breaks in org for some reason.
Oct 17 10:24:42 <ksynwa>	thblt: What is C-s mapped to? Just wondering if it's something different in your setup.
Oct 17 10:25:00 <wasamasa>	there's a whitespace folding flag in isearch for that purpose
Oct 17 10:25:01 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Which sketch?
Oct 17 10:25:04 <thblt>	ksynwa: isearch-forward
Oct 17 10:25:16 <wasamasa>	aidalgol: judean people's front
Oct 17 10:25:34 <pjb>	ksynwa: (re-search-forward "\\<The\\W+Selfish\\W+Gene\\>" nil t)
Oct 17 10:25:45 <thblt>	But it may be something in my config indeed.
Oct 17 10:25:54 <ksynwa>	Thanks a lot thblt and pjb 
Oct 17 10:26:18 <thblt>	No, not my config, it works from -q
Oct 17 10:26:22 <thblt>	ksynwa: ^
Oct 17 10:26:30 <pjb>	ksynwa: interactively, you can use search-forward-regexp C-c C-s and type \<The\W+Selfish\W+Gene\>
Oct 17 10:26:43 <ksynwa>	Noted. Thanks again. :)
Oct 17 10:26:55 <ksynwa>	What does \< denote pjb ?
Oct 17 10:27:07 <pjb>	ksynwa: you can also use M-x occur RET \<The\W+Selfish\W+Gene\> RET
Oct 17 10:27:07 <thblt>	word delimiter
Oct 17 10:27:12 <pjb>	\< is begin of word. 
Oct 17 10:27:22 <pjb>	\W is any non-word character. 
Oct 17 10:27:38 <ksynwa>	Got it. Thanks. That is very cool. I will read up more on this regex.
Oct 17 10:27:40 <thblt>	pjb: don't C-s the selfish gene RET works for you?
Oct 17 10:27:41 <pjb>	so it also match the,selfish: gene  etc…
Oct 17 10:27:53 <thblt>	Ho OK, your solution is broader.
Oct 17 10:28:02 <pjb>	thblt: nope, not if it's spread over several lines.
Oct 17 10:28:11 <thblt>	pjb: weird, it's the default for me.
Oct 17 10:28:21 <pjb>	Perhaps there's a global option for that.
Oct 17 10:28:30 <pjb>	or perhaps it depends on the mode of the buffer.
Oct 17 10:28:37 <pjb>	I've not tested in org buffers.
Oct 17 10:28:48 <pjb>	ksynwa: you may like M-x occur
Oct 17 10:28:50 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Ah, I never remember that film very well.
Oct 17 10:28:53 <thblt>	I tried emacs -q, create an org buffer, Typed: "Hello I love\nyou won't you\ntell me your name", C-s you tell me RET it finds lines 2-3 immediately.
Oct 17 10:29:26 <thblt>	On 27.1
Oct 17 10:29:37 <pjb>	interesting.
Oct 17 10:30:05 <pjb>	indeed, in org mode, C-s uses isearch and matches across lines.
Oct 17 10:30:56 <ksynwa>	yeah that's very handy. just tried it myself.
Oct 17 10:31:24 <ksynwa>	case insensitive too by default so that's good for me too
Oct 17 10:31:56 <thblt>	Default is case-smart (or something like that) I think: if you use uppercase it becomes case-sensitive.
Oct 17 10:46:14 <rwhoops>	TRAMP is included natively in emacs, right? 
Oct 17 10:46:38 <wasamasa>	yes
Oct 17 10:46:43 <rwhoops>	cool ty! 
Oct 17 11:05:10 <aidalgol>	Hmm, tramp could be used to connect to servers running non-free software.
Oct 17 11:07:48 <thblt>	aidalgol: let's write a free license that forbids it.
Oct 17 11:11:21 <aidalgol>	No, we should implement a LibreJS-like extension to the SSH protocol, and only connect to servers advertising that they do not use or steer users towards non-free software.
Oct 17 11:13:13 <ldlework>	wierd that the dash doc sets for javascript include a bunch of nonsense at the top
Oct 17 11:14:17 <thblt>	conversion bug?
Oct 17 11:15:04 <thblt>	rms has fascinating workflows https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01077.html
Oct 17 11:16:13 <ldlework>	darn both devdocs packages on melpa are busted too
Oct 17 11:16:16 <ldlework>	fooey
Oct 17 11:17:57 <thblt>	ldlework: looks good in zeal
Oct 17 11:21:45 <ldlework>	what's zeal
Oct 17 11:22:04 <ldlework>	i see
Oct 17 11:22:12 *	ldlework nix-env -i zeal
Oct 17 11:24:48 <ldlework>	thblt: yeah, i guess it's just that in eww all that crud at the top takes up a lot more space
Oct 17 11:28:00 <thblt>	ldlework: also you can try it first with `nix run nixpkgs.zeal` :)
Oct 17 11:28:20 <ldlework>	oh i didn't realize that was possible
Oct 17 11:28:32 <ldlework>	nix-shell is obvious, but that's even cooler
Oct 17 11:28:59 <ldlework>	it's so nice that nix is becoming so popular
Oct 17 11:29:05 <ldlework>	picking up tips in #emacs ;P
Oct 17 11:29:53 <Pickchea>	Hello people, I have a question about electric-pair-mode. When combined with org-mode (and only then) it pairs < with > and I really don't want that. Neither electric-pair-pairs nor electric-pair-text-pairs contains < and >. How can I turn this off? #org-mode couldn't help ATM.
Oct 17 11:30:36 <thblt>	ldlework: another quick tip, lookup in nix is expensive, nix-env -iA will often be a lot faster than -i
Oct 17 11:30:57 <thblt>	(with full path to derivation of course: nix-env -iA nixos.zeal)
Oct 17 11:32:40 <thblt>	eg with zeal: -iA 0.731s total -i 8.304s
Oct 17 12:53:22 <wgreenhouse>	ldlework: re "nonsense at the top," try tapping R in eww
Oct 17 13:28:40 <jlf>	,shit#emacssays is also we should implement a LibreJS-like extension to the SSH protocol, and only connect to servers advertising that they do not use or steer users towards non-free software.

Oct 17 13:46:47 <atw>	does dto's cell-mode support formulas? has anyone tried integrating it with calc?

Oct 17 14:48:19 <bremner>	rudybot: you'd think a bot would know about nasal demons
Oct 17 14:48:29 <rudybot>	bremner: Accursed nasal demons...
Oct 17 14:50:55 <Demosthenex>	is there a way for mu4e to alert if there isn't an email at a scheduled time?
Oct 17 15:52:21 <Wafficus>	Hi there, question about my Emacs config https://termbin.com/yn6l2
Oct 17 15:52:42 <Wafficus>	I have it stored within ~/.emacs.d/config.org
Oct 17 15:53:04 <Wafficus>	if I wanted to activate that and make it become actually part of my config from converting the .org file to a config, how do I go about doing that?
Oct 17 16:16:42 <Wafficus>	I updated my .init.org file here: https://termbin.com/35vx2
Oct 17 16:17:02 <Wafficus>	I'm wondering though, if I'm going to go for a literal config like this, do I store this in ~/.emacs.d
Oct 17 16:17:19 <Wafficus>	but have the output file be ~/.emacs ?
Oct 17 16:17:57 <Wafficus>	I ask because this is kind of the first time I'm doing any modifications to my config, so I'm a bit lost on how the organization of this should actually be using this org mode to config conversion method
Oct 17 16:19:47 <johnjay>	Wafficus: the best i've been able to figure out is .emacs overrides init.el
Oct 17 16:19:59 <johnjay>	so typically you would have a call in .emacs to load .emacs.d/init.el
Oct 17 16:20:18 <grym>	Wafficus: org-based configs have to be tangled into .el files 
Oct 17 16:20:24 <Wafficus>	hmm
Oct 17 16:20:24 <johnjay>	^
Oct 17 16:20:27 <Wafficus>	so its a ping pong effect
Oct 17 16:20:31 <Wafficus>	interesting
Oct 17 16:20:35 <Wafficus>	I KIND of get it
Oct 17 16:20:38 <wasamasa>	or loaded from a cleverly written .el file
Oct 17 16:20:41 <wasamasa>	your choice
Oct 17 16:20:45 <Wafficus>	but that's my noobish op right now
Oct 17 16:20:51 <Wafficus>	I think I should just seek out another couple of vids
Oct 17 16:20:58 <Wafficus>	the reason why I was gonna mess around with doing this
Oct 17 16:21:06 <Wafficus>	is that I wanted a single config across three separate machines
Oct 17 16:21:21 <Wafficus>	and more so, because I checked out a video on Hydras, and Helm, to the point where I've been blown away
Oct 17 16:21:30 <Wafficus>	and I'd like to start configin' it up ;)
Oct 17 16:21:43 <johnjay>	is one of those files config.org?
Oct 17 16:21:48 <johnjay>	or is config.org a huge file
Oct 17 16:21:52 <Wafficus>	well
Oct 17 16:21:59 <Wafficus>	I renamed it
Oct 17 16:22:01 <Wafficus>	one sec
Oct 17 16:22:09 <Wafficus>	I renamed it to ~/.emacs.d/init.org
Oct 17 16:22:13 <Wafficus>	however
Oct 17 16:22:14 <johnjay>	well there's a table of contents but i don't see anything else
Oct 17 16:22:24 <Wafficus>	now I'm confused, maybe I should rename it to ~/.emacs.d/.emacs.org
Oct 17 16:22:26 <Wafficus>	lol
Oct 17 16:22:30 <johnjay>	like you say treemacs, treemacs-projectile, hydra, dashboard
Oct 17 16:22:40 <Wafficus>	right that's more of what I plan on adding later
Oct 17 16:22:49 <Wafficus>	the "initialization" part at the top
Oct 17 16:22:54 <johnjay>	ok well if that's all you have then you don't have to do anything
Oct 17 16:22:56 <Wafficus>	that's where I'm trying to figure out directories on output
Oct 17 16:23:04 <johnjay>	just transfer that block of code to .emacs or init.el as you want
Oct 17 16:23:17 <Wafficus>	interesting
Oct 17 16:23:20 <Wafficus>	so they're in tandem then?
Oct 17 16:23:31 <johnjay>	no .emacs overrides init.el
Oct 17 16:23:34 <Wafficus>	I thought you could literally have everything in the same .org file
Oct 17 16:23:45 <johnjay>	so you need a call to (load "/home/blah/.emacs.d/init.el) in your .emacs
Oct 17 16:24:03 <johnjay>	or skip .emacs and just have init.el
Oct 17 16:24:18 <johnjay>	it doesn't matter how you do it. emacs just tries each thing in order trying to find your init file
Oct 17 16:24:44 <Wafficus>	well, I understand your point in terms of the .emacs config overriding everything
Oct 17 16:24:55 <Wafficus>	that makes sense because my current config setup is literally just ~/.emacs right now
Oct 17 16:25:05 <Wafficus>	anyway, to make it less confusing
Oct 17 16:25:15 <Wafficus>	I renamed it to: ~/.emacs.d/emacs.org
Oct 17 16:25:26 <Wafficus>	because eventually I would want the emacs.org file to become ~/.emacs
Oct 17 16:25:28 <Wafficus>	upon startup of Emacs
Oct 17 16:27:02 <johnjay>	well. i don't really understand your problem.
Oct 17 16:27:11 <johnjay>	you just have a small file with a few lines of code
Oct 17 16:27:25 <johnjay>	just put it in ~/.emacs.d/init.el and presto you have a literal setup
Oct 17 16:28:14 <johnjay>	or by literal you mean literate lol?
Oct 17 16:28:28 <johnjay>	then i suppose you would write init.el to call org mode to process your "literate" .org files
Oct 17 16:29:21 <jlf>	Wafficus: https://harryrschwartz.com/2016/02/15/switching-to-a-literate-emacs-configuration
Oct 17 16:36:17 <Wafficus>	jlf: ah yes, that dude is based
Oct 17 16:36:23 <Wafficus>	his Org Mode talk is what got me into Emacs
Oct 17 16:36:41 <Wafficus>	perfect, thanks for that reference
Oct 17 16:36:44 <Wafficus>	cool stuff mate
Oct 17 16:37:04 <jlf>	np
Oct 17 17:10:51 <BerndP>	shit#emacssays
Oct 17 17:13:13 <johnjay>	hrm how does org mode enable literate programming?
Oct 17 17:13:45 <johnjay>	i thought in a literate program you could like add chunks anywhere
Oct 17 17:13:45 <hodapp>	babel.
Oct 17 17:13:48 <johnjay>	maybe that's wrong
Oct 17 17:13:57 <johnjay>	like you could say "insert the following block of code at line 27"
Oct 17 17:14:17 <hodapp>	you can use named blocks of code that are tangled/woven as needed
Oct 17 17:14:53 <johnjay>	although most literate programs look like this i guess
Oct 17 17:15:01 <johnjay>	https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/ulam.w
Oct 17 17:15:28 <johnjay>	essentially a C file with lines such as   @<Set up the |decode| table@>; which are references to later blocks of code
Oct 17 17:15:54 <johnjay>	hrm i guess that makes sense.
Oct 17 17:16:22 <johnjay>	maybe I was thinking more of "append this code to chunk XYZ" as well
Oct 17 17:16:51 <grym>	johnjay: http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html e.g.
Oct 17 17:17:02 <johnjay>	so you could have #include<stdio.h> int main() { <<my code>>; return 0;} and then just append things to the start or end of <<my code>>
Oct 17 17:17:18 <grym>	everything from "write a bash snippet, C-c C-c that thing, oh hey it runs" to "tangle the whole thing and run it"
Oct 17 17:18:34 <johnjay>	right. i'm just talking about the structure of the file itself and how you specify chunks or whatever knuth called th em
Oct 17 17:19:14 <grym>	<s TAB
Oct 17 17:19:15 <grym>	:) 
Oct 17 17:19:21 <johnjay>	also how is that guy creating virtual machines so easily. I struggle with command lin qemu just to get a ubuntu machine up and running
Oct 17 17:20:29 <johnjay>	>Since version 1.6, Vagrant natively supports Docker containers, which in some cases can serve as a substitute for a fully virtualized operating system.[9]
Oct 17 17:20:58 <johnjay>	sudo apt-getting it right now
Oct 17 17:24:22 <mplsCorwin>	sudo apt-get lsit

Oct 17 17:43:30 <kudahtor228>	xDD
Oct 17 17:43:31 <johnjay>	make sure to type it capital letters in case your terminal didn't hear it the first time too
Oct 17 17:44:34 <kudahtor228>	after year+ of emacs I started to look like this https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/005/092/982/large/itteki-nakama-55121449-p0-master1200.jpg?1488405866
Oct 17 17:44:35 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/UrwtP1mJT5
Oct 17 17:46:27 <edgar-rft>	kudahtor228: and this will be your favourite emacs theme -> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PinkBliss
Oct 17 17:47:07 <kudahtor228>	sure but it's gotta have dark-grey background and more neutral saturation
Oct 17 17:47:21 <kudahtor228>	nyan theme would also do
Oct 17 17:48:31 <kudahtor228>	ye dark-grey background
Oct 17 17:59:38 <johnjay>	any ideas how I would fiddle with the mode line?
Oct 17 17:59:51 <johnjay>	I want to highlight the line count in red if it is over a certain number
Oct 17 18:00:13 <kudahtor228>	what's the point?
Oct 17 18:00:17 <mplsCorwin>	johnjay: probably by screwing with mode-line-format
Oct 17 18:00:21 <johnjay>	well i want to do other things to
Oct 17 18:00:35 <johnjay>	because the brain processes color independently and earlier than words
Oct 17 18:00:48 <johnjay>	so if you can encode as many things as possible with color or shading without having to read something you're good
Oct 17 18:01:02 <johnjay>	mplsCorwin: ah right that's what it is
Oct 17 18:01:04 <johnjay>	thanks
Oct 17 18:01:31 <johnjay>	for example i have a color highlighting command which looks at all functions defined in the current obarray and highlights them orange
Oct 17 18:01:43 <johnjay>	that way i can tell immediately if i've typed an emacs builtin correctly or not
Oct 17 18:02:43 <kudahtor228>	you can use auto-complete mode to be sure in that specific thing
Oct 17 18:02:57 <johnjay>	something called hdefd highlight mode
Oct 17 18:03:20 <johnjay>	i suppose but then you'd have to do it before finishing typing it
Oct 17 18:03:46 <johnjay>	auto complete has a place i'm just not sure how to use it
Oct 17 18:04:13 <mplsCorwin>	johnjay: I gotta get into that also, as I want to put the currently selected tool, line weight, color, and fill color into the model line for sketch.el
Oct 17 18:04:45 <mplsCorwin>	s.model.mode
Oct 17 18:06:07 <johnjay>	ah flyspell mode works, that's comforting
Oct 17 18:06:37 <mplsCorwin>	are you mocking me ;)
Oct 17 18:07:21 <kudahtor228>	I just remembered pink floyd's "any colour you like" song
Oct 17 18:07:32 <johnjay>	flyspell is smarter than I thought. it's not highlighting a word that's not a dictionary word but occurs a lot
Oct 17 18:07:56 <mplsCorwin>	For whatever reason I can't launch erc-spelling-mode when ERC starts.  I have to remember to enable it manually, although ERC comes up *thinking* it's enabled.
Oct 17 18:09:17 <kudahtor228>	oh dont u use rcirc
Oct 17 18:09:53 <kudahtor228>	I'm on it once and for all
Oct 17 18:09:57 <kudahtor228>	RCIRC
Oct 17 18:13:13 <kudahtor228>	johnjay: thats not smart lol
Oct 17 18:13:37 <kudahtor228>	I think thats configurable
Oct 17 18:16:07 <kudahtor228>	xDD "*** normalperson JOIN"
Oct 17 18:16:18 <kudahtor228>	whoever a normalperson is, he is not welcome
Oct 17 18:16:29 <normalperson>	normalemacsperson
Oct 17 18:16:37 <mplsCorwin>	welcome!
Oct 17 18:16:54 <normalperson>	mplsCorwin: thank you! :D
Oct 17 18:16:59 <normalperson>	elisp is hard
Oct 17 18:17:15 <mplsCorwin>	facts.
Oct 17 18:17:18 <normalperson>	but little by little, a loop here, a symbol there, I guess one will catch on eventually
Oct 17 18:17:54 <mplsCorwin>	I've been using emacs decades but really only elisp a year or so.  It gets more natural and once that happens it cascades quickly.
Oct 17 18:18:18 <alex11>	there's a guy who posted his .emacs file online going back decades and it's basically thesis length
Oct 17 18:18:19 <normalperson>	right the tipping point
Oct 17 18:18:27 <alex11>	which is fun
Oct 17 18:18:46 <normalperson>	lol
Oct 17 18:19:32 <alex11>	https://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/ see "my .emacs file"
Oct 17 18:20:13 <bandali>	kudahtor228, keep the trolling to a minimum, please
Oct 17 18:20:35 <normalperson>	alex11: not very modular ;P
Oct 17 18:20:56 <normalperson>	I use doom-emacs, spacemacs helped me a lot with getting started, butsettling for doom-emacs
Oct 17 18:21:01 <mplsCorwin>	"In this dissertation we demonstrate that is possible to get color-emoji completed from a custom completion framework defined within my .emacs file."
Oct 17 18:21:42 <thblt>	mplsCorwin: You really shouldn't say those things in public, someone may think it's a good idea.
Oct 17 18:21:46 <mplsCorwin>	Doom and spacemacs are wildly popular afaict
Oct 17 18:21:49 <alex11>	when i put in serious effort into learning emacs and stop being lazy (read: never) i'd like to do it with normal emacs and not derivatives
Oct 17 18:22:00 <mplsCorwin>	thblt: point.
Oct 17 18:22:51 <normalperson>	mplsCorwin: I had no idea what emacs can do until I found them
Oct 17 18:23:13 <normalperson>	that's probably the case for most people, so they never bother getting into emacs properly
Oct 17 18:23:39 <jlf>	mplsCorwin: standard ido could do that, just needs a list of name->emoji mappings
Oct 17 18:24:10 <mplsCorwin>	jlf: I wasn't so much after the feature as riffing on, e.g. https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Social_Construction_of_Freedom_in_Free_and_Open_Source_Software
Oct 17 18:24:52 <mplsCorwin>	normalperson: I rolled my eyes seeing emoji in Emacs and now I'm hooked ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 17 18:25:10 <jlf>	ah ok
Oct 17 18:25:55 <jlf>	haha, the site allegedly hosting the abstract doesn't resolve
Oct 17 18:25:57 <mplsCorwin>	literally someone's dissertation sources from the 8k sloc .emacs alex11 linked
Oct 17 18:28:17 <mplsCorwin>	jlf: seems that waybackmachine has us: https://web.archive.org/web/20160405071132/http://healthhacker.org/biella/coleman-abstract.pdf
Oct 17 18:29:33 <mplsCorwin>	Hrm.  Or maybe not.  Anyone actually get the PDF down?
Oct 17 18:30:04 <kudahtor228>	the link is broken
Oct 17 18:30:19 <mplsCorwin>	Gotcha!   https://web.archive.org/web/20060905011624/http://healthhacker.org/biella/coleman-abstract.pdf
Oct 17 18:31:14 <kudahtor228>	hackers hackers everywhere
Oct 17 18:31:30 <thblt>	7.5k non-comment slocs indeed. I wonder if it's an exception; I'd assume most `init.el`s tend to *decrease* in length after a certain point, because people 1) may revert some settings to their defaults once they understand Emacs better 2) will convert their main changes to standalone packages.
Oct 17 18:32:24 <mplsCorwin>	thblt: that's been my experience.  My .email is shrinking, mostly.
Oct 17 18:32:30 <mplsCorwin>	.emacs

Oct 17 18:33:03 <grym>	fing
Oct 17 18:34:06 <mplsCorwin>	o/ grym :)
Oct 17 18:42:28 <kudahtor228>	It'ss quite enjoying to read emacs guide while drunk
Oct 17 18:42:39 <kudahtor228>	reminds a fairy tale with chapters and stuff
Oct 17 18:46:30 <bbuccianti>	I think I understand git-rebase finally
Oct 17 18:46:38 <bbuccianti>	:D
Oct 17 18:53:30 <mplsCorwin>	"Woah."  "How do you feel?"  "I know git-rebase."  "Show me."
Oct 17 18:57:47 <bbuccianti>	I feel stupid
Oct 17 18:57:49 <bbuccianti>	hahaha
Oct 17 18:58:57 <thblt>	bbuccianti: what was your issue?
Oct 17 18:59:38 <bbuccianti>	I always wanted to apply my commits on top of another branch
Oct 17 18:59:48 <thblt>	rebase's the tool for that.
Oct 17 18:59:51 <thblt>	indeed.
Oct 17 18:59:55 <bbuccianti>	but never understand (until now) that you just need to be in that branch
Oct 17 19:00:02 <bbuccianti>	and call git rebase master
Oct 17 19:00:04 <bbuccianti>	for example
Oct 17 19:00:06 <bbuccianti>	and that's it
Oct 17 19:00:21 <thblt>	I see.  Yeah, git cli has its quirks
Oct 17 19:01:15 <bbuccianti>	but was a lot of git-rebase interactively painful editing history
Oct 17 19:01:42 <thblt>	Try magit :)
Oct 17 19:02:05 <bbuccianti>	today I understand that git log shows you the history from newest at the top to oldest at the bottom
Oct 17 19:02:13 <bbuccianti>	and git rebase -i shows the opposite
Oct 17 19:02:25 <bbuccianti>	first it's the oldest commit, bottom is the newest
Oct 17 19:04:20 <bbuccianti>	yeah, I think magit contributed to the confusion
Oct 17 19:15:30 <bremner>	so, pythonistas. Which priority queue implementation should I use
Oct 17 19:15:54 <bremner>	and why the heck isn't there an adequate one in the standard library
Oct 17 19:17:11 <oats>	bremner, the html parser took up all the rest of the space. No more room in the standard library
Oct 17 19:19:06 <manu1511>	does emacs default theme selected line color only look weird to me?
Oct 17 19:19:17 <bremner>	,m8b
Oct 17 19:19:17 <fsbot>	Cannot predict now
Oct 17 19:19:46 <manu1511>	it is too dark
Oct 17 19:20:18 <manu1511>	https://i.imgur.com/1r79f4C.png
Oct 17 19:20:36 <spikemaster>	is making giant comment section headers considered "literate" programming? or do you need to do something special like use org mode or something.
Oct 17 19:20:53 <bremner>	more the latter I'd say
Oct 17 19:20:54 <mplsCorwin>	yeah, it's an org-mode thing, mostly.
Oct 17 19:21:14 <bremner>	or historically things like "WEB"
Oct 17 19:21:19 <manu1511>	spikemaster: it is quite common to do this in php
Oct 17 19:22:18 <thblt>	strictly speaking, literate programming is not just comments without markers, it's also the possibility of naming blocks and inserting it in a different order, reusing them, and so on.
Oct 17 19:22:22 <thblt>	Org provides all that.
Oct 17 19:22:51 <thblt>	Most “literale” emacs configs just use org as a code outliner, and there are easier ways to do that.
Oct 17 19:23:40 <mplsCorwin>	I think literate programing goes beyond documenting your code, or even interweaving of documentation.  It's wrapping the code into a documentation so that the human becomes the first tier consumer of the file (vs the elisp interpreter or whathaveyou)
Oct 17 19:24:08 <mplsCorwin>	org is our main technique for this.
Oct 17 19:24:14 <mplsCorwin>	erm.  tool.
Oct 17 19:25:10 <bremner>	speaking of org-mode, can it create directories to tangle into
Oct 17 19:25:31 <thblt>	This is why reordering matters, because the order in which you explain something is not necessarily the right order for the compiler. 
Oct 17 19:25:56 <bremner>	I use literate-programming for lectures, and only show the important bits of code
Oct 17 19:26:11 <bremner>	also, :mkdirp yes
Oct 17 19:28:39 <thblt>	(as Aristotle said)
Oct 17 19:46:18 <mplsCorwin>	RE native-comp, Eli is pushing for the about screen to show information about native comp, which makes sense to me.  I'm thinking it might be nice to show also whether we are using eln or elc (or el?) for individual packages.  Does that seem useful to anyone else?
Oct 17 19:49:21 <spikemaster>	knowing if something is using el, elc, eln sounds useful to me. i vote yes
Oct 17 19:49:52 <thblt>	yes yes yes.
Oct 17 19:50:30 <mplsCorwin>	Thank you, spikemaster, thblt.  If anyone here is in a position to try sending a patch along with this suggestion I'd happily defer, otherwise I'll send the idea off in few hours if I don't see it appear.
Oct 17 19:51:58 <mplsCorwin>	I like.  I think I see that Eli is still up and doing email so I'll send something quick off now.  Thanks again.

Oct 17 19:53:32 <thblt>	mplsCorwin: It's this discussion https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01132.html, right?
Oct 17 19:53:43 <mplsCorwin>	yes
Oct 17 19:53:51 <mplsCorwin>	wait
Oct 17 19:53:53 <thblt>	Cool. I'm syncing my repo to have a look.
Oct 17 19:54:03 <thblt>	Wait no?
Oct 17 19:54:05 <mplsCorwin>	OK, I'm holding off then thblt.
Oct 17 19:54:14 <mplsCorwin>	I'm double checking, one moment please.
Oct 17 19:54:39 <thblt>	Don't hold off I'm all for the idea :)
Oct 17 19:55:05 <mplsCorwin>	ok!  Let me finish making sure we're on the same thread and I'll press send.
Oct 17 19:56:35 <mplsCorwin>	thblt: the subject line I'm looking at is "feature/native-comp] provide a user feedback on Emacs being native compiled"
Oct 17 19:57:18 <mplsCorwin>	thblt: here's where I planned to reply in: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2020-10/msg01335.html
Oct 17 19:57:35 <mplsCorwin>	(I have *got* to migrate to gnus)
Oct 17 19:58:24 <thblt>	mplsCorwin: that's a great idea. I'm not sure there's any con to this.
Oct 17 20:02:32 <thblt>	reading the debbugs thread: the performance gain is impressive and the cost seems ridiculous.
Oct 17 20:03:08 <mplsCorwin>	thblt: this is going to be the most exciting feature since color's in -nw ;)
Oct 17 20:03:16 <mplsCorwin>	s/\'//
Oct 17 20:03:20 <thblt>	(Except for [N|Gu]ix users whose Emacs recompiles every time there's a minor change far down in the dependency chain)
Oct 17 20:03:44 <thblt>	And until we get rid of -nw for a new display engine :D /s
Oct 17 20:03:51 <mplsCorwin>	hahaha
Oct 17 20:24:46 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, what MUA do you use now?
Oct 17 20:27:23 <mplsCorwin>	can't remember.  def not gmail.
Oct 17 20:27:39 <mplsCorwin>	wait.  check that.  Gmail.
Oct 17 20:28:27 <parsnip>	lol
Oct 17 20:29:16 <bandali>	oh lol
Oct 17 20:29:51 <thblt>	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2020-10/msg01140.html Can you freeze Emacs forever by making it use a font that doesn't have A-F0-9?
Oct 17 20:30:18 <thblt>	I'm referring to “No, Emacs doesn't create any glyphs dynamically for tofus, it simply uses a smaller font in a box it itself draws.”
Oct 17 20:30:51 <thblt>	If it cannot draw hex numbers, it will draw another box in the box, and so on recursively until the end of time or more probably stack overflow.
Oct 17 20:31:30 <mplsCorwin>	yeah, I'm seeing it. Pretty good question from my limited understanding.
Oct 17 20:32:01 <thblt>	I may give it a try if I find the time.
Oct 17 20:34:37 <mplsCorwin>	That would be cool.  It would be a good time to raise such an issue as it seems we are shining lights into that particular darkness just now.
Oct 17 20:42:14 <ecbrown>	i'd like to give the feedback:  native-comp is outstanding, and i can't envision ever going back to anything but
Oct 17 20:45:27 <bremner>	cool.
Oct 17 20:48:46 <mplsCorwin>	RE native-comp, Here's the suggestion from earlier: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2020-10/msg01361.html
Oct 17 20:54:11 <ecbrown>	good suggestion, i couldn't tell you whether my modules are ???-compiled
Oct 17 20:55:25 <ecbrown>	i just know they're not elc's, because i whack them before each startup
Oct 17 20:56:39 <mplsCorwin>	huh, why?
Oct 17 20:57:07 <ecbrown>	some bizarro combination of macos, native-comp, straight, and org not loading org correctly
Oct 17 20:57:44 <ecbrown>	(and, org-contrib, i need one package from there org-contacts)
Oct 17 20:57:57 <mplsCorwin>	I've got a few that I have to remember not to compile but so far things are stable compiling *most* of my init.
Oct 17 20:58:28 <ecbrown>	whenever i fail to nuke the elc's, org-version returns N/A
Oct 17 20:58:48 <ecbrown>	and that wreaks havoc elsewhere, being not a number
Oct 17 20:58:53 <mplsCorwin>	Let me check but I think init-org.el is one of the ones I can't byte-compile.
Oct 17 21:00:16 <mplsCorwin>	Hmmm, no I guess I have an init-org.elc not using org-contrib at present tho)
Oct 17 21:17:28 <jlf>	ecbrown: maybe check ,,df list-load-path-shadows
Oct 17 21:17:28 <fsbot>	list-load-path-shadows is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp
Oct 17 21:17:28 <fsbot>	function in ‘shadow.el’.
Oct 17 21:17:28 <fsbot>	(list-load-path-shadows &optional STRINGP)
Oct 17 21:17:28 <fsbot>	Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files. ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 17 21:21:17 <pjb>	it's misnamed!!!  It doesn't return a list, it returns a string such as: (list-load-path-shadows) -> "
Oct 17 21:21:18 <pjb>	72 Emacs Lisp load-path shadowings were found"
Oct 17 21:21:33 <pjb>	somebody report a bug!
Oct 17 21:31:07 <laertus>	how do i paste the contents of the most recent entry in the kill ring in to a calc-mode buffer?
Oct 17 21:31:39 <laertus>	nevermind.. it's just control-y for me.. :P
Oct 17 21:45:14 <parsnip>	hmm, i'm using ubuntu 20.04 and `sudo apt-cache search taskd` comes up empty
Oct 17 21:45:28 <parsnip>	even though it appears here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/taskd.1.html
Oct 17 21:48:17 <parsnip>	asked on #ubuntu
Oct 17 21:51:44 <wasamasa>	hm, my ELPA feed thing failed several times in a row
Oct 17 21:51:50 <wasamasa>	let's hope this is GNU ELPA being funny
Oct 17 21:52:11 <wasamasa>	nope, marmalade
Oct 17 21:52:22 <wasamasa>	is it completely dead now?
Oct 17 21:52:27 <wasamasa>	502 :<
Oct 17 21:53:00 <parsnip>	lol, marmalade
Oct 17 21:54:16 <wasamasa>	I'm more annoyed the traceback is long enough to not contain the specific archive it fails for
Oct 17 21:55:27 <wasamasa>	anyway, this morning I asked for someone with a twitter account for a favor
Oct 17 21:55:44 <wasamasa>	maybe now such a person is online willing to send a friendly DM to a similarly neglected emacs service
Oct 17 21:56:30 <wasamasa>	https://nitter.net/Holocronweaver apparently runs wikemacs these days and should really renew the certificate
Oct 17 21:56:37 <wasamasa>	or consider using let's encrypt
Oct 17 22:03:17 <frdg>	what are your top 3 favorite minor modes? I'm looking to try some new stuff out. 
Oct 17 22:05:12 <wasamasa>	oh and if someone's up to twittering, nicferrier could also be notified about marmalade
Oct 17 22:07:17 <mplsCorwin>	neither of these folks follow me or accept messages from those they don't follow.  would it be helpful just tweeting @ them, do you think?
Oct 17 22:08:43 <wasamasa>	you mean publicly mentioning them? absolutely
Oct 17 22:10:10 <wasamasa>	for nic I guess I could try sending an email to their git address
Oct 17 22:12:23 <mplsCorwin>	Those who wish could find my SO to Jesse on twitter, here: https://twitter.com/mplscorwin/status/1317574108431962122
Oct 17 22:13:37 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: left nic alone on twitter per your last.
Oct 17 22:14:04 <davidl>	Im getting this old bug thing: gui-get-selection: (error "Timed out waiting for reply from selection owner") - https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/5703/has-anyone-else-encountered-gui-get-selection-error-timed-out-bug using emacs 27.1
Oct 17 22:14:05 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/lc7UCQtBUJ
Oct 17 22:14:30 <davidl>	any suggestions how to fix that?
Oct 17 22:16:21 <mplsCorwin>	one thing to research this could be to take the list of bug reports from this SO and plug them into debugs and see what may have happened with each.  https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=<ID>
Oct 17 22:18:04 <mplsCorwin>	Understanding that might get this down to where someone, here, or on the Emacs-Devel@lists.gnu.org Mailing List could propose a simple patch or work-around to move this forward or close whatever remaining problem you are finding.
Oct 17 22:21:10 <dale>	I think my music streaming service has decided I like only Contemporary Christian and... this sounds like Japanese Dubstep or something.
Oct 17 22:22:03 <dale>	I dojn
Oct 17 22:22:10 <wasamasa>	mplsCorwin: hm, I don't really see it hurting, in case his email turns out to be the wrong place
Oct 17 22:22:20 <dale>	Er, I don't like either of those, to be clear.  Well, I don't know, if this Japanese Dubstep is a thing I might be able to get on board, let me hear more.
Oct 17 22:22:33 <wasamasa>	do you have examples of that?
Oct 17 22:22:36 <wasamasa>	is it like babymetal?
Oct 17 22:22:45 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: no problem.
Oct 17 22:23:51 <dale>	I'm not sure what this is actually.  Maybe this awful link works for non-subscribers? https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kRHcQp6OzhBbIcX0_qstMZfGjSa6vcXbE
Oct 17 22:24:35 <dale>	I think the artist is called "yu" and the album is named "Baby Doc".
Oct 17 22:25:46 <wasamasa>	what exactly about this does make you think dubstep?
Oct 17 22:26:28 <wasamasa>	oh, the track after the intro
Oct 17 22:29:40 <wasamasa>	not on discogs either
Oct 17 22:31:52 <dale>	Yeah, I did not find much info on it.
Oct 17 22:32:44 <wasamasa>	I'm not a fan
Oct 17 22:33:57 <wasamasa>	the things I associate with dubstep is slow pace and dragging drums, ideally on a ridiculously overpriced gold-laced vinyl record
Oct 17 22:34:25 <wasamasa>	https://www.discogs.com/Massive-Attack-vs-Burial-Four-Walls-Paradise-Circus/master/611553
Oct 17 22:34:30 <wasamasa>	> Somebody payed 89 euro for the sleeve only ! ! !
Oct 17 22:37:02 <mplsCorwin>	finally poked nic on twitter: https://twitter.com/mplscorwin/status/1317580399036477441
Oct 17 22:37:04 <dale>	I know Burial is supposed to be dubstep, but it seems so different from other dubstep.
Oct 17 22:37:29 <dale>	Ha, I see Wikipedia calls Skrillex "brostep".  I can get on board with that.
Oct 17 22:37:43 <wasamasa>	mplsCorwin: thanks
Oct 17 22:38:39 <wasamasa>	dale: there's a few other of the more ambient kind, I enjoyed Ital Tek
Oct 17 22:38:52 <dale>	wasamasa: Thanks, I will check it out.
Oct 17 22:40:53 <wasamasa>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tUUPiDcAc
Oct 17 22:48:32 <dale>	Yeah, I'm liking this.  Listening to "Cobra" off Hollowed now too.
Oct 17 22:49:15 <wasamasa>	the newer releases seem a bit more regular beat
Oct 17 22:49:20 <wasamasa>	still nice
Oct 17 22:49:39 <wasamasa>	if you up the speed, you get drum and bass
Oct 17 22:51:04 <mplsCorwin>	"nice" - wasamasa plz lock the post /s https://bru.st/i/firefox_sR51Nv2T58.png
Oct 17 22:51:22 <wasamasa>	uh
Oct 17 22:52:15 <mplsCorwin>	"How many up-votes did that reddit post about dungeon-mode get?"  "69." "Nice."
Oct 17 23:08:09 <mplsCorwin>	Andreas replied on the suggesting of native comp including telling which of elc/eln/el is being used: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2020-10/msg01370.html
Oct 17 23:08:28 <mplsCorwin>	s/ing/ion
Oct 17 23:19:52 <ryouma>	this fails to rebind DEL (translated from <backspace>).  shouldn't it absolutely do so?
Oct 17 23:19:55 <ryouma>	(define-key global-map [remap backward-delete-char-untabify] #'my-backward-delete-char-untabify)
Oct 17 23:20:30 <ryouma>	in sh-mode where backward-delete-char-untabify is bound to del/<backspace>
Oct 17 23:21:05 <ryouma>	i also tried   (define-key sh-mode-map [remap backward-delete-char-untabify] #'my-backward-delete-char-untabify)
Oct 17 23:22:54 <dale>	ryouma: Not sure about global-map if it's bound in sh-mode-map, but doing it in sh-mode-map should work I'd think.
Oct 17 23:23:19 <dale>	ryouma: And you're testing this by hitting the key and not by evaluating a call to backward-delete-char-untabify, right?
Oct 17 23:23:46 <dale>	ryouma: Like for example (call-interactively 'backward-delete-char-untabify) will not pay attention to command remapping, IIRC.  Likewise M-x ignores command remapping.
Oct 17 23:26:18 <dale>	ryouma: Hm, I just tried this and C-h k DEL even says that I have remapped the command, but it doesn't seem to... work.
Oct 17 23:27:16 <dale>	I can rebind newline just fine in sh-mode-map.
Oct 17 23:29:12 <dale>	ryouma: In sh-mode-map turns out you need to remap delete-backward-char instead of backward-delete-char-untabify.
Oct 17 23:30:28 <dale>	ryouma: I guess this is because sh-mode-map already remaps delete-backward-char to backward-delete-char-untabify.
Oct 17 23:31:09 <dale>	I would have expected C-h k to tell me this.  I guess I was also hoping that command remapping would "chain", so if X is mapped to Y, and Y is remapped to Z, Emacs would follow X → Y → Z, but apparently that is not the case?
Oct 17 23:43:39 <ryouma>	yes to this, meaning that i expected the remap to make the key call the my- version --- 15:23 <dale> ryouma: And you're testing this by hitting the key and not by evaluating a call to backward-delete-char-untabify, right?
Oct 17 23:44:06 <ryouma>	also c-h c is giving the old command which imo is wrong
Oct 17 23:44:41 <parsnip>	how do i learn how handshake works in a case as general as taskwarrior+taskserver?
Oct 17 23:44:54 <parsnip>	i've got a self signed ca.cert.pem, i guess
Oct 17 23:45:15 <parsnip>	hmm, maybe i should practice in a language easier than dart
Oct 17 23:45:19 <parsnip>	like python or something
Oct 17 23:45:42 <parsnip>	the prototype is in c++, and i can't read it
Oct 17 23:46:32 <jfb4>	why use dart 
Oct 17 23:47:09 <ryouma>	ah.  i agree it should be recursive (unless there is some reason i am not thinking of.  however, i am also doing (define-key global-map [remap delete-backward-char] #'alpha-delete-backward-char).  perhaps i need to try that in sh-mode-map also. --- 15:30 <dale> ryouma: I guess this is because sh-mode-map already remaps delete-backward-char to backward-delete-char-untabify.
Oct 17 23:51:38 <ryouma>	also is it calling the alias backward-delete-char?
Oct 17 23:52:33 <ryouma>	it isn't
Oct 17 23:52:57 <ryouma>	shell-script-mode is alias for sh-mode and the file is named sh-script...  not exactly  consistent are we?
Oct 17 23:56:16 <ryouma>	not fixable by just remapping all the emacs commands apparently
Oct 17 23:56:34 <ryouma>	it just won't remap
Oct 17 23:58:32 <ryouma>	no tools here for fixing it (info "(elisp) Remapping Commands")
Oct 17 23:59:27 <ryouma>	i don't know why this is not remapping the original.  maybe i have to remap to nil then remap?
Oct 18 00:00:36 <dale>	ryouma: You probably need to remap delete-backward-char in sh-mode-map.
Oct 18 00:01:05 <ryouma>	i tried that :/
Oct 18 00:01:10 <dale>	ryouma: I closed the emacs -Q I had open where I was trying it, but something like (define-key sh-mode-map [remap delete-backward-char] (lambda () (interactive) (message "test"))) worked for me.
Oct 18 00:02:01 <ryouma>	for me del remains bound to backward-delete-char-untabify
Oct 18 00:04:09 <ryouma>	a single invocation of (define-key sh-mode-map [remap delete-backward-char] nil) with no further remapping... guess what occurs... actually did the remapping to my command.  weird.
Oct 18 00:04:17 <dale>	ryouma: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fsugqcb7em1n3x4/Screen%20Shot%202020-10-17%20at%2018.02.52.png?dl=0 FWIW, this is just after pressing backspace in the sh-mode buffer, notice echo area.
Oct 18 00:07:17 <jfb4>	mplsCorwin: thanks for the link on native-comp.  I wonder how close we will get to the performance of Common Lisp in elisp.
Oct 18 00:09:03 <ryouma>	dale: thanks
Oct 18 00:09:29 <ryouma>	now to see if it all works properly
Oct 18 00:12:04 <ryouma>	ah, looks like i will have to do eval-after-load and rely on the feature that my remapping works even if it is done /before/ unremapping... but that will be brittle as sh-mode might change that remapping.  then i guess i have to load sh-mode really really early... don't want to do that... don't want to remap late either... can't think of a good solution.  but it will at least remap.
Oct 18 00:14:22 <jlf>	rudybot: quote
Oct 18 00:14:22 <rudybot>	jlf: Let's reserve our future selves for present use.
Oct 18 00:15:16 <ryouma>	probably the unremap after feature works because it is a different map
Oct 18 00:16:15 <bpalmer>	ryouma: why are you remapping things if all that you want is DEL to run a different command?
Oct 18 00:16:41 <ryouma>	because i want everything that runs those commands interactively to do what i want
Oct 18 00:17:16 <ryouma>	the emacs thing i am fixing is connected to those commands, rather than the key bindings, so accordingly i operate at the command level and not the key binding level
Oct 18 00:17:21 <bpalmer>	OK. Does that work? I assumed the remapping is only when key binds are involved. I should test.
Oct 18 00:17:30 <ryouma>	no, it is
Oct 18 00:18:04 <ryouma>	i want all key bindings bound to the relevant commands to do what i want.  but suppose those change.  i don't want my commands to run on the old keybinding.  for example.
Oct 18 00:18:15 <jlf>	bpalmer: iirc that's how visual-line-mode remaps C-e and friends
Oct 18 00:18:32 <ryouma>	s/those change/the bindings change in emacs or some mode
Oct 18 00:19:22 <ryouma>	i could instead defadvice the commands, but then i wouol dhave to do my behavior if and only if it was callled interactively.  that feels less transparent to me.
Oct 18 00:20:35 <ryouma>	in that i'd be c-h c'ing the bindings and wondering why they weren't working if anything changed underneath my fixes)
Oct 18 00:20:58 <bpalmer>	jlf: I just don't see why (call-interactively 'foo)  would look at the keymaps for any foo remappings.
Oct 18 00:21:01 <ryouma>	if i do this, then i see whehter the bindings are my commands
Oct 18 00:21:19 <ryouma>	it wouldn't
Oct 18 00:21:47 <ryouma>	which is ok in this case
Oct 18 00:22:01 <ryouma>	remapping actually changes the bindings themselves
Oct 18 00:24:27 <ryouma>	anyway i have fixed it by the with-eval-after-load thing
Oct 18 00:24:36 <ryouma>	followed by unremapping sh-mode-map
Oct 18 00:25:07 <ryouma>	so it will be brittle to changes in sh-script.el but it works
Oct 18 00:26:44 <rpav>	gah isn't there a way to prevent surrogate minibuffers or whatever
Oct 18 00:27:15 <ryouma>	that is an interesting idea though bpalmer.  a facility that could change only the interactively called versions of commands.  but then it would have to be only direct calls.  and i'd want that documented in the help buffer just as dale hoped would occur for sh-mode's (sh-script's) remapping.
Oct 18 00:27:56 <jlf>	bpalmer: you're right, i don't think it does - visual-line-mode-map contains entries like (define-key map [remap move-end-of-line]  'end-of-visual-line) , but  M-: (end-of-line)  invokes the standard e-o-l function
Oct 18 00:28:29 <ryouma>	(i guess there isn't much of such a thing as non-interactively called commands if you do not restrict it to direct calls -- except timers and such)
Oct 18 00:28:44 <bpalmer>	Aha. Thanks for doing that test, jlf. 
Oct 18 00:29:15 <ryouma>	such a facility would be more robust to keymap changes, which would be a boon
Oct 18 00:29:21 <ryouma>	as long as help says what it is doing
Oct 18 00:31:27 <bpalmer>	ryouma: I am left not understanding the remap position, but I will blame it on needing to hydrate. But for what you're describing now, advice would work, and would show up in the help buffer.
Oct 18 00:31:56 <bpalmer>	your advice would just need to check called-interactively-p and change behavior.
Oct 18 00:32:01 <ryouma>	right
Oct 18 00:32:05 <ryouma>	that would work
Oct 18 00:32:22 <ryouma>	but it feels better to do the remapping for some reason
Oct 18 00:32:38 <bpalmer>	and with that, I'm off to the watering trough.
Oct 18 00:32:43 <ryouma>	if i run into trouble i will do the advice
Oct 18 00:34:32 <ryouma>	i used to use advice for this, on a different command that is pretty much only called interactively
Oct 18 00:42:42 <bpalmer>	Let's offer beads to buy property in New York City.
Oct 18 00:50:34 <cluck>	sex workers already do, stop trying disrupt their market 
Oct 18 00:52:41 <jlf>	cluck says something creepy, everybody take a shot
Oct 18 00:54:22 <parsnip>	how do you read c++
Oct 18 00:54:25 <parsnip>	hold your breath?
Oct 18 00:54:41 <parsnip>	hit your weak hand with a hammer?
Oct 18 00:55:11 <bpalmer>	if your hand is weak, cut it off.
Oct 18 00:56:00 <parsnip>	it is a little dry...
Oct 18 00:56:29 <bpalmer>	It's important to not repeat yourself in C++, except for where you really want to repeat yourself so the compiler knows what you're trying to do.
Oct 18 00:57:46 <bpalmer>	Amusingly, the override specifier in C++ was added just to avoid programmers having to sprinkle virtual everywhere.
Oct 18 00:58:03 <parsnip>	why would a client pass a credential with a server cert?
Oct 18 00:58:23 <parsnip>	in other words, what does credential mean there?
Oct 18 00:58:24 <bpalmer>	But, it's not actually a keyword. It just has special meaning when used after a member function declaration.

Oct 18 01:31:35 <offby1>	rudybot: in Soviet Russia
Oct 18 01:31:39 <rudybot>	*offby1: Only in Soviet Russia
Oct 18 01:31:43 <offby1>	rudybot: in Soviet Union
Oct 18 01:31:44 <rudybot>	*offby1: well, see, the thing there is, just because the soviet union went away does not mean that russia did, and both they and we seem to be seeing some value in kindling a new, albeit mostly nominal rather than real, rivalry
Oct 18 01:32:27 <parsnip>	rudybot: i'll kindling you in a minute
Oct 18 01:32:45 <rudybot>	parsnip: but I do, they are the perfect size for keeping a study burn on a cooking fire, somethin bigger than kindling, but not yet a log.
Oct 18 01:32:49 <bpalmer>	rudybot: what if Russia did go away? Can you prove that northern "Asia" even exists? 
Oct 18 01:32:59 <rudybot>	bpalmer: continental asia/russia? japan! western europe/northern africa/middle east? portugal! antarctica? australia! south america? panama! australia? UK!
Oct 18 01:33:16 <cluck>	offby1: knowing when to stop is a skill your potus doesn't have so maybe rudybot really is smarter and sentient

Oct 18 01:33:47 <rudybot>	parsnip: It's just taken from the docs. I just want to skip the handshake. I'm doing a hackathon right now and I don't have time for this secure websocket business.
Oct 18 01:34:08 <parsnip>	lol
Oct 18 01:34:20 <parsnip>	upgrade complete

Oct 18 01:44:41 <bpalmer>	sadly, van halen is passed.
Oct 18 01:55:47 <bpalmer>	looks like some people on emacs-devel are tiring of the drama.
Oct 18 02:05:53 <ryouma>	rider?
Oct 18 02:10:54 <ecbrown>	rms has a speaker's "rider" which outline his preferences. not uncommon among people who frequently speak on the lecture circuit
Oct 18 02:11:16 <offby1>	rudybot: black ash from the foundry hangs like a hood
Oct 18 02:11:22 <bremner>	but somewhat less common among speakers at free software events
Oct 18 02:11:26 <rudybot>	*offby1: xos4 is the foundry ("vendor", if you will) 
Oct 18 02:11:51 *	ecbrown wonders who else is frequently asked to speak about free software
Oct 18 02:12:42 <ecbrown>	(not that it matters, just being argumentative)
Oct 18 02:14:30 <ryouma>	 ecbrown there is an anthropologist who studies free software
Oct 18 02:14:39 <ryouma>	she has been at it since late 1990s
Oct 18 02:15:22 <ecbrown>	interesting topic.  if you know her name, i would like to look her up some time
Oct 18 02:16:26 *	ecbrown is still hunting for usenet archives surrounding lucid/gnu schism
Oct 18 02:17:33 <ryouma>	if it is the same anthropologist i am thinking of, she gave a ted talk in the past few y i think
Oct 18 02:18:09 <bremner>	that would be Biella Coleman, probably
Oct 18 02:18:16 <bremner>	currently at McGill, afaik
Oct 18 02:19:17 <ryouma>	name doesn't ring a bell but it could be.  i remmber her more than her name.
Oct 18 02:19:25 <bremner>	although I'm a bit unclear why its anthropology and not sociology
Oct 18 02:19:29 <ryouma>	i vaguely recall some kind of carribean connection
Oct 18 02:19:39 <bremner>	yes, PR
Oct 18 02:20:03 <ryouma>	really?  then probably it is she.  her accent is standard american english however.
Oct 18 02:20:10 <ryouma>	different set of tools perhaps
Oct 18 02:20:27 <ryouma>	she really puts on a speakers tone, i.e. takes lecturing seriously
Oct 18 02:20:39 <jlf>	mplsCorwin linked this earlier - https://web.archive.org/web/20110726143735/http://healthhacker.org/biella/coleman-abstract.pdf
Oct 18 02:20:56 <ecbrown>	bremner: thanks, checking out her page now
Oct 18 02:20:56 <bpalmer>	"standard american english" ?
Oct 18 02:21:02 <jlf>	ryouma: americans don't have accents, silly
Oct 18 02:21:17 <ryouma>	?
Oct 18 02:21:23 <bremner>	bpalmer: mexican english, obviously
Oct 18 02:22:22 <ryouma>	a specific named accent.  code switching often switches TO it.  academics and others often use it.  i was not being precise -- her normal accent is certainly close to sae but could be different.  --- 18:21 <bpalmer> "standard american english" ?
Oct 18 02:22:37 <ryouma>	nationwide tv announcers use it.  etc.
Oct 18 02:22:50 <ryouma>	often*
Oct 18 02:23:03 <bremner>	oh, so you mean Canadian English
Oct 18 02:23:08 <cluck>	bremner: antropology because <insert fossils joke>
Oct 18 02:23:24 <bpalmer>	Hmm. I hadn't run into it named as such before. 'The idea that there is one accent that is the most neutrally American has been around for a long time, and it is usually called "General American." The term was coined in 1925 by the descriptive linguist George Philip Krapp as a way to describe the accent he thought was becoming the norm in the United States.'
Oct 18 02:23:32 <ryouma>	https://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/standardamerican/
Oct 18 02:23:56 <bpalmer>	Taken from https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/united-states-of-accents-general-american/
Oct 18 02:23:59 <ryouma>	(i merely meant that she did not have a carribean seeming accent in her normal speech)
Oct 18 02:24:04 <jlf>	i thought https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent was regarded as more or less standard
Oct 18 02:24:42 <ryouma>	canadian english is close to sae i think
Oct 18 02:25:06 <ryouma>	well, the canadian english i have heard, and i am excluding the canadian accent that sounds like french
Oct 18 02:25:25 <bpalmer>	I associate mid-atlantic with 1950s and 1960s "standard"
Oct 18 02:25:37 <ryouma>	mid atlantic is probably a bit different but close
Oct 18 02:25:41 <cluck>	bpalmer: the de facto standard is the trans atlantic american, you can thank hollywood for that 
Oct 18 02:25:42 <bpalmer>	or maybe 1940s
Oct 18 02:26:33 <ryouma>	oh, no midatlantic soudns different
Oct 18 02:27:14 <ryouma>	so california adopted the atlantic?
Oct 18 02:27:26 <bremner>	north america is a torus
Oct 18 02:28:14 <bremner>	or maybe a Ford Taurus
Oct 18 02:29:55 <bpalmer>	Hey, mercury rises into taurus 
Oct 18 02:31:17 <bpalmer>	Interestingly, I have never particularly associated Puerto Rican accents with other Caribbean accents. 
Oct 18 02:32:29 <ryouma>	she did not capitalize the the in the atlantic
Oct 18 02:32:47 <ryouma>	hmm neither have i really.  not like zombomacs.
Oct 18 02:33:18 <ryouma>	what does trans atlantic american mean?
Oct 18 02:35:02 <ryouma>	she also misspelled chaos :)
Oct 18 02:36:51 <bpalmer>	chaos is a word that should probably not have a fixed spelling
Oct 18 02:38:28 <cluck>	ryouma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent
Oct 18 02:39:00 <grym>	bpalmer: but very fixed yogurt delivery times
Oct 18 02:41:46 <bpalmer>	when's the best time for yogurt to arrive?
Oct 18 02:43:31 <grym>	in ankh moropork, exactly 07:00 
Oct 18 02:44:11 <grym>	suspiciously, all customers get theirs then by the same deliveryman 
Oct 18 02:44:27 <grym>	(and he spells chaos with a 'k')
Oct 18 02:51:46 <bpalmer>	I think I missed that entry
Oct 18 02:52:14 <grym>	ah.  Thief of Time 
Oct 18 02:52:44 <grym>	a personal favorite.  history monks, mostly standalone 
Oct 18 02:57:25 <johnjay>	my mind is blown right now. apparently in medieval england they didn't have the concept of swear words
Oct 18 02:57:42 <johnjay>	like defined words that were offensive no matter what context they were used in
Oct 18 02:58:56 <grym>	i hope you brought recipts 
Oct 18 02:59:11 <grym>	because we have friggin' scads of words that exists So That You Did Not Say The Bad Ones
Oct 18 02:59:30 <johnjay>	instead if you wanted to offend someone you'd wish ill on them or maybe invoke the body part of god
Oct 18 02:59:40 <johnjay>	like, By God's Pinky You Suck SIr
Oct 18 02:59:55 <johnjay>	or "Get Stuffed" perhaps
Oct 18 03:00:03 <bpalmer>	on the other hand , earlier folks did: 'proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear - arkto - with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal's true name might cause it to appear'
Oct 18 03:00:13 <grym>	that's less giving offense than it is literally praying for someone to come to grief
Oct 18 03:00:42 <grym>	bpalmer: yeah, i was just going to mention that one 
Oct 18 03:00:46 <johnjay>	yes to modern ears. but to a medieval person they would interpret that as if you said something very naughty.
Oct 18 03:00:55 <grym>	johnjay: i mean.  you did 
Oct 18 03:01:09 <grym>	'i hope you die' is pretty naughty!
Oct 18 03:01:33 <johnjay>	yeah but it doesn't sound as harsh as saying naughty words like get effed you *** 
Oct 18 03:01:42 <johnjay>	i hope you die is more like, i don't like you, you're ugly
Oct 18 03:01:44 <grym>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 18 03:01:56 <bpalmer>	I hope you start an inexpressibly amazing eternal life free from suffering soon!
Oct 18 03:02:03 <grym>	go back far enough and people living in britain assuredly did understand profanity 
Oct 18 03:02:04 <cluck>	during the war of roses that's like.. what else're you gonna hope..
Oct 18 03:02:06 <johnjay>	but yes it's interesting how some of those forms do have staying power
Oct 18 03:02:15 <grym>	c.f. our boy catullus 
Oct 18 03:02:23 <johnjay>	in particular "Get ***ed" would probably still work as profanity in medieval time period
Oct 18 03:02:34 <grym>	johnjay: what's that time period, to you 
Oct 18 03:02:49 <bpalmer>	it's somewhat a lost cause, but there are distinctions to be drawn among profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity
Oct 18 03:03:00 <johnjay>	if you're a conneticut yankee in king arthur's court you may need to know this
Oct 18 03:03:00 <grym>	indeed. 
Oct 18 03:03:15 <johnjay>	yes apparently medieval people had almost no concept of vulgarity or obscenity
Oct 18 03:03:23 <johnjay>	there are even street signs with naughty words on them
Oct 18 03:03:25 <cluck>	bpalmer: i did not take you for a transhumanist waiting to be diditized..
Oct 18 03:03:36 <bpalmer>	cluck: why wait?
Oct 18 03:03:43 <grym>	johnjay: then again, we have records of a man whose name was recorded as 'john le fucker' and 'roger fuckbythenavele'
Oct 18 03:03:58 <grym>	"so stupid he doesn't know where his dick goes"
Oct 18 03:04:01 <johnjay>	exactly, same thing. it wasn't the word itself that was offensive
Oct 18 03:04:09 <grym>	i mean.  is it ever
Oct 18 03:04:12 <grym>	(no)
Oct 18 03:04:18 <bpalmer>	johnjay: it might be better to think in terms of, if they had offensive concepts, they don't match what is commonly *nowadays* considered offensive
Oct 18 03:04:30 <johnjay>	it would be as if you don't get offended if your doctor asks for a stool sample. but you would if he asked for a s**t sample
Oct 18 03:04:42 <grym>	‘There may be some truth to the old joke that in Los Angeles, people say “Have a nice day” and mean “Fuck off,” while in New York, people say “Fuck off” and mean “Have a nice day.”’
Oct 18 03:04:46 <johnjay>	they had offensive concepts yes,  just not individual "offense words"
Oct 18 03:05:14 *	bpalmer hums skeptically.
Oct 18 03:05:30 <grym>	^ 
Oct 18 03:06:11 <grym>	tangentially, my first real relationship was with a bilingual english/spanish speaker
Oct 18 03:06:26 <grym>	she had no problems swearing like a sailor in english, but flatly refused to use spanish profanity 
Oct 18 03:06:33 <grym>	as it was "too mean"
Oct 18 03:06:39 <johnjay>	that's funny
Oct 18 03:06:53 <cluck>	rudybot: they are about to have their minds blown by realizing puss in boots was a pet caffe before coffee was known in those shores
Oct 18 03:07:00 <rudybot>	cluck: Btw, why is Puss in Boots Spanish in the latest movie?
Oct 18 03:07:02 <johnjay>	maybe spanish is more medieval being a romance language in that it is less about the word than the concept. not sure
Oct 18 03:07:05 <jlf>	rudybot: ¿profanity o profundity?
Oct 18 03:07:06 <rudybot>	jlf: pretty small edit distance between profanity and profundity.. coincidence??
Oct 18 03:07:09 <grym>	where english starts at 'hey fuck you', her colombian spanish started at "go fuck your grandmother"
Oct 18 03:07:23 <grym>	and like, escalated from there
Oct 18 03:07:30 *	ecbrown thinks its about time to raise complaints about #emacs
Oct 18 03:07:36 <ecbrown>	really
Oct 18 03:07:39 <jlf>	rudybot: i feel like you really _get_ me, you know?
Oct 18 03:07:42 <rudybot>	jlf: y it's a great channel, i just get lost in all the details i have to keep in order to think in haskell... it does interest me though, so i know i'll check it out again in more detail. i just feel like htdp is really giving me a great grounding on the absolute fundamentals
Oct 18 03:07:43 <ecbrown>	take this stuff to emacs-offtopic
Oct 18 03:07:56 <grym>	but, i'm there already :) 
Oct 18 03:07:57 <grym>	it's here!
Oct 18 03:08:44 <grym>	noone's said anything on topic in like 3 hours 
Oct 18 03:08:44 <johnjay>	grym: the video i watched didn't address specifically those phrases. but i guess they would probably just confuse a medieval person
Oct 18 03:08:53 <ecbrown>	grym: so leave the channel idle
Oct 18 03:08:58 <ecbrown>	better than this dreck
Oct 18 03:09:00 <johnjay>	like if you said "go kiss your cat!!!"
Oct 18 03:09:04 <grym>	ecbrown: tune out!
Oct 18 03:09:14 <ecbrown>	come on
Oct 18 03:09:36 <grym>	ecbrown: this channel historically is excellent at shutting up fast when people have actual things to talk about 
Oct 18 03:09:39 <grym>	i'm very happy about that 
Oct 18 03:09:45 *	jlf yawns pointedly
Oct 18 03:09:46 <grym>	and certainly try to play along. 
Oct 18 03:09:56 <ecbrown>	grym: no, it doesn't. people get drowned out all the time
Oct 18 03:10:07 <ecbrown>	and why you insist, is beyond me
Oct 18 03:10:26 <ecbrown>	*persist
Oct 18 03:11:19 <grym>	so strict for a saturday night 
Oct 18 03:12:07 <ecbrown>	it's the official gnu emacs channel, not a bordello
Oct 18 03:12:23 <jlf>	let's drop this, please
Oct 18 03:12:29 <ecbrown>	you are an op, enforce the rules
Oct 18 03:12:41 <jlf>	be careful what you ask for
Oct 18 03:13:17 <cluck>	grym: people often lose/recalibrate the emotional load relating to words/expressions when learning new languages
Oct 18 03:16:01 <cluck>	it's GNU/bordello and we insist you avoid pointing out our cow faced hosts as they are free
Oct 18 03:16:17 <ecbrown>	jlf: i already asked for it.  if you take action against me for insisting on basic decorum, i will escalate
Oct 18 03:16:35 <grym>	rudybot: let's investigate normative discrepancies
Oct 18 03:16:36 <rudybot>	grym: More and more discrepancies are appearing within implementations.  For example, is a macro call in the body of DEFINE-SYNTAX recognized or not?
Oct 18 03:16:41 <jlf>	you seem to have escalated some time ago
Oct 18 03:16:42 <grym>	very profound
Oct 18 03:22:17 <johnjay>	or profane
Oct 18 03:23:55 <grym>	i don't have religious opinions on macro calls
Oct 18 03:33:46 <terpri_>	,emacs-related multilingual profanity
Oct 18 03:33:46 <fsbot>	It may not be that obvious for the layman, but multilingual profanity is indeed emacs-related, terpri_.
Oct 18 03:39:17 <terpri_>	(doctor.el has lists of "foul" words, insults, etc., but the emacs doctor only speaks english and elisp)
Oct 18 03:40:04 <grym>	i would go so far as to sign the hoop-jumping forms to add a list of fowl words 
Oct 18 03:40:15 <grym>	terpri_: does it even try to avoid scunthorpe issues
Oct 18 03:41:14 <jlf>	sure you're not chicken?
Oct 18 03:41:32 <parsnip>	,chicken

Oct 18 03:46:29 <cluck>	rudybot: censor my onions facebook style 
Oct 18 03:46:31 <rudybot>	cluck: And I also enjoy olives and cocktail onions that appear in martinis.
Oct 18 03:46:56 <wheats>	yay. onion... cocktails?
Oct 18 03:47:40 <terpri_>	grym, yes, in that it "parses" input at the word level and has a fixed set of known words
Oct 18 03:47:48 <grym>	lest we forget that GOFAI still kiiind of exists :)
Oct 18 03:47:56 <grym>	which i suppose applies to onions and doctor.el 
Oct 18 03:48:21 <grym>	terpri_: ok.  that is better than really stupid regex, at least

Oct 18 03:53:59 <grym>	terpri_: ah, not the one with molten lead 
Oct 18 03:55:24 <terpri_>	nah, we already have preview-latex for that
Oct 18 03:57:00 <grym>	(the documentary is really something) 
Oct 18 04:28:43 <Viking667>	whoops, just compiling, wondering if I should have made "make clean" first, directly after a ./configure?
Oct 18 04:29:29 <ecbrown>	if it is a clean source tree, not necessary
Oct 18 04:29:54 <ecbrown>	if you have a "significant" change, then always good to make distclean
Oct 18 04:30:01 <Viking667>	it's not, though a lot of .o files got made anyhow.
Oct 18 04:30:23 <Viking667>	What's temacs?
Oct 18 04:30:24 <fsbot>	temacs is (info "(elisp) Building Emacs")
Oct 18 04:30:30 <ecbrown>	well, unless you're actively developing on the source, where it would be an inconvenience to recompile the whole thing, then just make distclean
Oct 18 04:30:35 <grym>	whatever god-emperor cmake requires 
Oct 18 04:30:49 <Viking667>	uh, there's no cmake being used here.
Oct 18 04:30:57 <grym>	probably for the best 
Oct 18 04:31:08 <Viking667>	... or at least, I'm not using it. I just used "./configure" followed by "make"
Oct 18 04:31:21 <grym>	i make clean when i've previously tried and failed to build something and suspect i have cruft 
Oct 18 04:33:34 <ecbrown>	Viking667: should be good, unless you have installed other software that might trigger a feature (e.g. libotf, mailutils, etc)
Oct 18 04:33:57 <ecbrown>	(there are a bazillion scenarios)
Oct 18 04:35:03 <Viking667>	I only installed librsvg2-devel, which is why I reran configure (after a git pull)
Oct 18 04:35:15 <ecbrown>	yes, so play it safe and make distclean
Oct 18 04:35:27 <Viking667>	hm. Means I'll have to junk this compile then.
Oct 18 04:36:02 <ecbrown>	sometimes it's for the best -- rather than getting further into compile and discovering some weird error
Oct 18 04:36:04 <Viking667>	Ouch. It got rid of the configu
Oct 18 04:36:18 <Viking667>	time to regen config.cache
Oct 18 04:36:19 <ecbrown>	sure
Oct 18 04:36:24 <ecbrown>	definitely
Oct 18 04:37:26 <Viking667>	Only reason for rsvg2 is because I tried a file and got invalid image format for svg, turns out I never had devel headers, so compiled emacs never had support. Ah well.
Oct 18 04:37:49 <Viking667>	I was trying svg tags in org mode, which is what was failing.
Oct 18 04:38:10 <ecbrown>	yeah, some day you may wish to figure out how to get a "kitchen sink" emacs  --   as many yes's as possible in configure
Oct 18 04:38:48 <ecbrown>	modules, mailutils, otf, etc.   (not always possible on macos, i've noticed since a lot of those features are subsumbed by native libraries)
Oct 18 04:39:12 <ecbrown>	to coin a phrase: "loaded for bearmacs"
Oct 18 04:40:11 <Viking667>	heh. I think I'd rather put in what I know I'm going to use.
Oct 18 04:40:57 <Viking667>	After all, why bother putting in VT502 support when I don't have one? (Not for emacs, for something else instead)
Oct 18 04:41:23 <ecbrown>	bragging rights
Oct 18 04:41:29 <Viking667>	(yawn)
Oct 18 04:41:44 <Viking667>	actually, (is-yawn-mode t)
Oct 18 04:41:59 <edrx>	I am trying to locate the blogs and youtube channels of people who publish videos about emacs... sachac used to mention some of them in Emacs News, but I didn't pay much attention...
Oct 18 04:42:19 <Viking667>	she's made a lot of blog posts, you could try there.
Oct 18 04:42:32 <edrx>	anyone remembers any channels/blogs that host local copies of the videos?
Oct 18 04:42:41 <Viking667>	Aside from youtube?
Oct 18 04:42:56 <jlf>	edrx: ,,emacsrocks
Oct 18 04:42:57 <fsbot>	emacsrocks are an emacs tricks and tips screencast series by magnars: http://emacsrocks.com
Oct 18 04:42:57 <edrx>	yes - ideally local MP4s
Oct 18 04:43:13 <sachac>	edrx: Do you want to go through https://github.com/sachac/emacs-news and maybe filter index.org for youtube mentions?
Oct 18 04:43:27 <sachac>	edrx: You might be able to pass them through youtube-dl
Oct 18 04:43:30 <Viking667>	Oh wow, I didn't know she was on github.
Oct 18 04:43:31 <grym>	edrx: no, but there's always youtube-dl 
Oct 18 04:43:43 <Viking667>	hi sachac
Oct 18 04:43:50 <edrx>	hi sachac!
Oct 18 04:43:57 <sachac>	Viking667: I keep forgetting to commit and push the Org file I use to generate emacs-news. =)
Oct 18 04:44:00 <Viking667>	remember me from Undernet days?
Oct 18 04:44:07 <sachac>	Viking667: #linuxhelp ! =)
Oct 18 04:44:10 <Viking667>	Yeah!
Oct 18 04:44:24 <Viking667>	Those were good days.
Oct 18 04:45:40 <Viking667>	and youtube-dl has a -F switch you can use, that'll list what formats youtube can deliver you. i.e. youtube-dl -F https://some.youtube.url/watch?v=thisvideo
Oct 18 04:46:09 <Viking667>	You might need ffmpeg to glue bits together 
Oct 18 04:46:13 <grym>	you will 
Oct 18 04:46:17 <grym>	it's a very nice little tool, though 
Oct 18 04:46:24 <Viking667>	Yes.
Oct 18 04:46:30 <edrx>	sachac: I just implemented a better way to create elisp hyperlinks to videos, and I guess that some people - especially beginners - will prefer to download videos with wget rather than with youtube-dl... I was trying to see if I could find other people who make their mp4s available besides me
Oct 18 04:46:33 <grym>	ffmpeg and imagemagick lurk at the bottom of many stacks
Oct 18 04:46:57 <sachac>	edrx: Neat!
Oct 18 04:47:18 <edrx>	Viking667: thanks! I use youtube-dl a lot, usually with -f 18...
Oct 18 04:47:24 <Viking667>	edrx: the problem I have with simply wgetting, is that you have ta parse three files before you get to a URL that a media player can get
Oct 18 04:47:36 <sachac>	edrx: Hmm... there are two .mp4 links in index.org: http://portfolio.cooper.stevenson.name/latex/spacemacs_latex_demo.mp4 and https://video.fosdem.org/2020/UD2.119/emacsthoughts.mp4
Oct 18 04:47:43 <Viking667>	And I normally use -f 251 for music files, as I don't generally need the video
Oct 18 04:47:45 <refusenick>	I can make EXWM neither automatically create a new frame/workspace for the 2nd monitor nor size the 2nd frame correctly
Oct 18 04:47:55 <edrx>	sachac: great!!! thanks!!! =)
Oct 18 04:47:56 <refusenick>	(screen is 1920x1080, but EXWM exceeds its borders, as did LXQt)(screen is 1920x1080, but EXWM exceeds its borders, as did LXQt)
Oct 18 04:48:00 <sachac>	edrx: https://emacsnyc.org/videos.html has a whole bunch, too
Oct 18 04:49:03 <edrx>	sachac: btw, the example that I will show in the end of my presentation at the emacsconf this year will be about Emacs New / emacs-tangents!

Oct 18 04:51:02 <sachac>	edrx: I feel like I'm kinda harsh in trying to get you to squish the eev talk down to 10 minutes. ;) Do you think you can rise to the challenge?
Oct 18 04:51:51 <sachac>	edrx: It's just that the schedule is super packed and I want to see if we can fit all the talks in. I'm checking with bandali to see if we can figure out a way to let interested people jump in for Q&A or extended interaction even if the livestream's showing the next talk.
Oct 18 04:52:16 <edrx>	no, I can't... I started to write an e-mail explaining why but I haven't finished it yet. I can try to make it fit in 40 minutes, though
Oct 18 04:53:19 <sachac>	True, you want to cover a lot.
Oct 18 04:53:37 <edrx>	but I'm preparing my e-scripts/slides and I think I'll be able to start rehearsing some parts of it tomorrow

Oct 18 05:01:40 <sachac>	ryouma: Yeah, that does suck
Oct 18 05:02:25 <loganlee>	hello
Oct 18 05:03:10 <Viking667>	Incidentally, I found Org mode was blimming marvelous (along with some macros I wrote) for getting extra stuff into religious texts, such as putting a list of headings and book names into a bible version that doesn't already have them.
Oct 18 05:03:17 <ryouma>	i need to convert coding or something but got a file in presumably a format that i can use with a debiasn dict command of somt type: ���� [����] /(adj-t,adv-to) (1) (obsc) relaxed and enjoyable/(adj-t,adv-to) (2) (obsc) spacious/vast/(adj-t,adv-to) (3) (obsc) heavily trafficked/bustling/busy/
Oct 18 05:03:55 <ryouma>	Viking667: what did you do specifically to annotate?
Oct 18 05:04:17 <ryouma>	ohhhhhhh you orgified non-org text.  nm.
Oct 18 05:06:29 <johnjay>	sweet. bookmark+ lets you use emacs bookmarks on webpages
Oct 18 05:06:41 <ryouma>	(Viking667: i was thinking you had external text and then used org to magically annotate, but i am guessing you took the whole file and added .org to it)
Oct 18 05:06:43 <Viking667>	I don't know the term in this context, but I have source texts in osis.xml format. I had a keyboard macro that I used to pull items from an Org list, and put the relevant one in at my point in the text.
Oct 18 05:06:55 <johnjay>	the chorus sings hallelujah. hallelujahhhhh
Oct 18 05:06:56 <Viking667>	so no, I didn't orgify the source text.
Oct 18 05:06:59 <ryouma>	oh
Oct 18 05:07:39 <Viking667>	For example, Headings.org contains .... ahh well, I can put the file itself up on pastebin, you can take a look for yourselves.
Oct 18 05:07:45 <Viking667>	Give me a few...
Oct 18 05:07:57 <ryouma>	(not that i can read teh kanji if that is what it is... i wonder if any dict software adds ruby text)
Oct 18 05:08:03 <refusenick>	a Christian Viking?
Oct 18 05:08:12 <ryouma>	xml makes my brain go haywire, no need
Oct 18 05:08:48 <ryouma>	well he'
Oct 18 05:08:58 <ryouma>	nm
Oct 18 05:10:45 <Viking667>	https://pastebin.com/sb6V4Cbt
Oct 18 05:10:47 <sachac>	edrx: just talking to bandali at the moment
Oct 18 05:11:01 <ryouma>	i sorely need some resource for ja to en and en to ja of various types
Oct 18 05:11:09 <ryouma>	s/need/want
Oct 18 05:13:10 <ryouma>	(and ja resources in general i guess -- i should at least nail down conditionals and tenses)
Oct 18 05:13:21 <Viking667>	https://pastebin.com/ZkQp7j54    <-- that's a fragment of the NKJV xml docs. The previous link was my Headings.org
Oct 18 05:13:41 <Viking667>	I've included the keyboard macro I used to copy text between two windows.
Oct 18 05:14:30 <ryouma>	i see (didn't click but i get the idea i think)
Oct 18 05:14:32 <Viking667>	Anyhow, I thought it was a good way to (ab)use Org mode.
Oct 18 05:14:38 <ryouma>	good idea to use kb macros
Oct 18 05:14:51 <Viking667>	Couldn't do it any other way.
Oct 18 05:15:03 <Viking667>	Well, I couldn't, anyhow. I don't know how.
Oct 18 05:15:20 <ryouma>	there is a kb macro to elisp interactive command converter someplace
Oct 18 05:15:35 <Viking667>	heh. I had to go in the other direction
Oct 18 05:15:48 <ryouma>	oh?
Oct 18 05:16:04 <ryouma>	oh using commands
Oct 18 05:16:31 <Viking667>	I had a sequence of commands. Not elisp commands as such, just simple stuff. I then turned it into a kb macro, then turned THAT into something I could include in my .emacs
Oct 18 05:16:42 <ryouma>	ah
Oct 18 05:17:14 <ryouma>	that last step has a packagte someplace
Oct 18 05:18:41 <Viking667>	Probably does, I ended up with (fset 'TopicPaste (lambda (&optional arg) "Keyboard macro." (interactive "p") (kmacro-exec-ring-item (quote ([1 right right .....])))))
Oct 18 05:18:42 <Viking667>	 
Oct 18 05:18:44 <wgreenhouse>	refusenick: "exceed borders" smells like an underscan problem
Oct 18 05:19:11 <Viking667>	dunno. If he can't move his mouse off the screen, that doesn't indicate underscan
Oct 18 05:20:11 <wgreenhouse>	they don't say either way afaict. and I suspect the monitor is a TV (it's described as 1920x1080)
Oct 18 05:22:34 <refusenick>	Viking667: I'm able to move the mouse off the screen
Oct 18 05:22:43 <refusenick>	(in all directions, unfortunately)
Oct 18 05:22:49 <wgreenhouse>	yeah then it's underscan
Oct 18 05:23:01 <refusenick>	wgreenhouse: thanks, will look up a fix
Oct 18 05:23:28 <wgreenhouse>	the exact knob to turn depends on your gpu/driver
Oct 18 05:30:38 <Viking667>	You could also look at the tv/monitor settings
Oct 18 05:30:51 <Viking667>	my Viewsonic has an overscan setting in its menu.

Oct 18 19:45:25 <achilles>	this works, i am using mouse-2 for smex already without problem
Oct 18 19:46:03 <mplsCorwin>	So you want 'execute-extended-command (e.g. non-smex) on a different button?  Should be the same approach..
Oct 18 19:47:18 <achilles>	no, not M-x.
Oct 18 19:48:07 <achilles>	I want to set C-x to the left mouse button which is the mouse-1.
Oct 18 19:48:09 <mplsCorwin>	Ahhhhhhh, finally I grok. You want to hit mouse-1 and then have next input taken against the C-x map.
Oct 18 19:48:39 <achilles>	exactly
Oct 18 19:48:53 <mplsCorwin>	So C-x C-v becomes (kbd "<mouse-1> C-v")
Oct 18 19:49:01 <achilles>	yes
Oct 18 19:49:25 <mplsCorwin>	Yeah, I have no idea how to do that, lol :)  *Someone* here likely has ideas, tho and now the problem is *quite* clear :)
Oct 18 19:50:17 <mplsCorwin>	Alternately, this could be a good question for the emacs-help@lists.gnu.org mailing list.
Oct 18 19:51:50 <wasamasa>	there's a translation map for such purposes
Oct 18 19:52:00 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, did you perhaps mean help-gnu-emacs@gnu.org  ?
Oct 18 19:52:18 <wasamasa>	which is mostly used for mouse stuff, lol
Oct 18 19:52:22 <achilles>	mplsCorwin: thanks.
Oct 18 19:52:23 <wasamasa>	so that might explain the behavior
Oct 18 19:52:32 <mplsCorwin>	bandali: yes.  Yes I absolutely did.
Oct 18 19:52:35 <wasamasa>	mouse-1 is translated to mouse--click-1-maybe-follows-link here
Oct 18 19:52:35 <bandali>	:-)
Oct 18 19:52:53 <achilles>	wasamasa: i remember like i tried already but let me try again.
Oct 18 19:53:31 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: does that mean we would (bind-key *that-map* [mouse-1] 'fun) vs using global-set-key ?
Oct 18 19:53:32 <wasamasa>	you should be able to translate mouse-1 to (kbd "C-x") there
Oct 18 19:56:55 <achilles>	wasamasa: yes, works like a charm. thank you.
Oct 18 19:57:00 <achilles>	(define-key key-translation-map [mouse-1] (kbd "C-x"))
Oct 18 19:57:17 <wasamasa>	fun
Oct 18 19:57:24 <mplsCorwin>	Thanks for sharing back your solution achilles!
Oct 18 19:57:56 <mplsCorwin>	,key-translation-map
Oct 18 19:57:58 <fsbot>	remap is like (define-key key-translation-map (kbd ":") (kbd "M-x"))
Oct 18 19:58:04 <mplsCorwin>	lol
Oct 18 19:58:36 <mplsCorwin>	,key-translation-map is also useful for mouse, e.g. (define-key key-translation-map [mouse-1] (kbd "C-x"))
Oct 18 19:58:37 <fsbot>	ERROR: [set-also] But there’s no such term: key-translation-map
Oct 18 19:58:52 <mplsCorwin>	,key-translation-map is useful for mouse, e.g. (define-key key-translation-map [mouse-1] (kbd "C-x"))
Oct 18 19:58:54 <fsbot>	Created new note for "key-translation-map"
Oct 18 20:00:29 <achilles>	mplsCorwin: of course. i am not sure how it'd work with regular mouse but with a legacy thinkpad touchpad, should be very amazing i hope.
Oct 18 20:01:07 <mplsCorwin>	Indeed.  I was just musing how to make mouse-4 swap out such bindings to create easy swapping around this.
Oct 18 20:02:28 <achilles>	still need to work on C-x C-x though because it returns C-x double-mouse-1
Oct 18 20:02:51 <mplsCorwin>	I'm writing a game sort of thing, this is making me think about having a "right-hand-on-mouse" set of bindings that could make mouse cord replace things that are on the right side of the keyboard and so hard to reach with hands in "gaming position".
Oct 18 20:03:36 <mplsCorwin>	Yeah, I guess that makes sense.  C-h v last-command RET maybe
Oct 18 20:04:09 <mplsCorwin>	You are probably on your way to your own interactive function to handled C-x would be my sense but perhaps wasamasa has more ideas :)
Oct 18 20:04:34 <bpalmer>	pity those who use wireless mice.
Oct 18 20:04:42 <wasamasa>	well, for that this map offers to use a function
Oct 18 20:05:14 <wasamasa>	that function can look up what key to return instead
Oct 18 20:05:25 <wasamasa>	though, nah
Oct 18 20:05:33 <wasamasa>	maybe not
Oct 18 20:05:40 <achilles>	and also mouse needs to stay on the middle.
Oct 18 20:06:03 <wasamasa>	instead of C-x C-x, wouldn't you click twice?
Oct 18 20:06:21 <wasamasa>	or maybe that's what you could check with a helper function bound to mouse-1
Oct 18 20:07:16 <achilles>	maybe i can translate double-mouse-1 to C-x C-x same way
Oct 18 20:08:01 <achilles>	yeah, it worked.
Oct 18 20:08:34 <wasamasa>	ah, a more elegant solution
Oct 18 20:10:04 <achilles>	i should also define same like this
Oct 18 20:10:43 <achilles>	(define-key key-translation-map [mode-line mouse-1] (kbd "C-x"))
Oct 18 20:10:53 <achilles>	so i wouldn't need to keep mouse on the middle
Oct 18 20:11:15 <achilles>	now it requires a function i guess. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 18 20:11:42 <mplsCorwin>	double-mouse-1 to C-x C-x seems useful in an of it self.
Oct 18 20:25:15 <laertus>	how can i get the most recent kill on the kill ring, without properties, in to a variable?
Oct 18 20:25:50 <bpalmer>	(setq x (substring-no-properties (car kill-ring)))
Oct 18 20:26:08 <bpalmer>	insert error checking to suit.

Oct 18 20:46:25 <bpalmer>	actually, I'm working on a new language IQL  : each statement is preceded by an IQ test, the score of which probabilistically affects whether the statement is executed or skipped over.
Oct 18 20:46:26 <achilles>	translating mouse-1 to C-x, one needs to cover at least 20 different cases.

Oct 18 20:47:26 <bpalmer>	But it does serve a fine purpose of not trying to use the badly defined notion of IQ except as regards to IQ tests, a nicely tautological position.
Oct 18 20:47:39 *	edgar-rft is working on some new language where it's sufficient to have an IQ of 1 or 0
Oct 18 20:47:52 <laertus>	achilles: sorry, i mean from elisp.. and i don't want to open the directory, just get it back as a string
Oct 18 20:49:12 <achilles>	laertus: difficult to tell without seeing the code you're working on.
Oct 18 20:49:15 <hodapp>	I wrote a language once that only smart people could work in but then for some reason I wasn't able to really use it.
Oct 18 20:49:20 <bpalmer>	you can always force it with ivy-completing-read, using directory-files and a file-directory-p predicate
Oct 18 20:49:25 <hodapp>	wasn't my fault though.
Oct 18 20:49:34 <laertus>	bpalmer: thanks, i'll look in to that
Oct 18 20:49:52 <laertus>	by the way, what is the difference between ivy-completing-read and ivy-read?
Oct 18 20:49:55 <bpalmer>	(may be a better way; I don't use it)
Oct 18 20:50:05 <laertus>	ivy-read does completion too...
Oct 18 20:50:28 <bpalmer>	laertus: different function signatures
Oct 18 20:50:33 <edgar-rft>	the first one has a longer name
Oct 18 20:50:38 <bpalmer>	ivy-completing-read is a drop-in replacement for completing-read
Oct 18 20:54:10 <laertus>	in hydra, if i use the ?x? hint (where "x" is any head, not the literal character "x"), hydra will display extra hints along the bottom of the hydra
Oct 18 20:54:27 <laertus>	is there any way of forcing hydra not to display those extra hints?
Oct 18 21:11:14 <perrier-jouet>	hi all
Oct 18 21:11:20 <mplsCorwin>	o/
Oct 18 21:12:00 <perrier-jouet>	does exisit a whiteboard for emacs ? a collaborative white board with math and physiscs engine that evaluates the writing ???
Oct 18 21:12:01 <fsbot>	Ask yourself, do you really want to know?
Oct 18 21:15:44 <DigDug>	hi perrier-jouet 
Oct 18 21:15:55 <DigDug>	i don't know the answer to your question, but that is a cool idea!
Oct 18 21:16:06 <mplsCorwin>	There's discussion the ML recently about a new collaborative editing mode that already handles multi-party editing of such as org-docs including cooling folding sync.  I'm working on a "sketch" app right now, so there's hope in this direction.  Not sure of anything great that's a fully baked solution for whiteboarding in Emacs.
Oct 18 21:25:38 <wasamasa>	if your sketchboard is a buffer and your pen is self-insert-key, you're set
Oct 18 21:25:43 <wasamasa>	play some multiplayer notepad
Oct 18 21:25:50 <wasamasa>	use calc
Oct 18 21:26:32 <wasamasa>	emacs is not a GUI-first application
Oct 18 21:26:50 <wasamasa>	graphics are a big hack and so is anything related to them
Oct 18 21:27:04 <wasamasa>	if you pull something like this off, it's going to be notable for the hack value, not its quality
Oct 18 21:27:53 <wasamasa>	besides, we talked about it before and I offered some pointers towards a solution done in a proper lisp
Oct 18 21:28:09 <wasamasa>	compare that with emacs and you have your answer
Oct 18 21:29:30 <wasamasa>	I wouldn't be surprised if there's a comparable thing in CL, maybe even scheme
Oct 18 21:29:41 <wasamasa>	check out cliki for the former
Oct 18 21:29:54 <wasamasa>	there's lots of interesting real-world projects there
Oct 18 21:29:58 <DigDug>	CL?
Oct 18 21:29:59 <fsbot>	CL is [0] Common Lisp, a general-purpose multi-paradigm programming language. Ask me about: <pcl>, <cl.el> ;;[ ,more / ,dump]
Oct 18 21:30:05 <DigDug>	thanks fsbot 
Oct 18 21:30:05 <fsbot>	DigDug, no problem
Oct 18 21:33:50 <laertus>	there has been talk in emacs circles of using CRDT (Conflict-free replicated data type) for collaborative editing, as CRDT is supposed to guarantee consistency
Oct 18 21:34:33 <laertus>	but i was reading this HN thread on "Why CRDT didn't work out as well for collaborative editing xi-editor" - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19886883
Oct 18 21:35:07 <laertus>	and there someone mentioned that "Yes, CRDTs will guarantee that clients converge to an identical, mathematically "consistent" state eventually, but there's no guarantee whether or not that mathematically "consistent" state would make any sense to the application business logic that needs to consume that state, or to the human that needs to reason about the rendered result."
Oct 18 21:35:47 <laertus>	the proof is in the pudding, though
Oct 18 21:36:08 <laertus>	if someone can make it work (and CRDT is supposedly used on sites like google docs), then that's all that matters
Oct 18 21:40:43 <Allos>	After `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`, the error message stops showing. What  should I do?
Oct 18 21:41:06 <Allos>	Oh, I also get an empty *Backtrace* buffer.
Oct 18 21:42:35 <laertus>	aha
Oct 18 21:42:51 <laertus>	i've also had issues with an empty *Backtrace* buffer, and the backtrace actually being dumped in my current buffer
Oct 18 21:42:55 <laertus>	i see i'm not the only one
Oct 18 21:43:05 <laertus>	Allos: are you also on emacs 27.1 ?
Oct 18 21:43:16 <Allos>	Yeah
Oct 18 21:43:20 *	laertus nods
Oct 18 21:43:32 <laertus>	it started happening to me after i upgraded from 26.1 to 27.1
Oct 18 21:43:50 <Allos>	No error message with debug-on-error, or empty backtrace?
Oct 18 21:44:32 <laertus>	well, in only one case did toggle-debug-on-error not actually start debugging for me.. in all other cases it's worked (though with the issues i describe above)
Oct 18 21:45:12 <laertus>	i can't remember when the debugging didn't work, unfortunately
Oct 18 21:45:16 <laertus>	but usually it does
Oct 18 21:45:40 <laertus>	and i'm afraid i don't know the cause of these issues, nor how to troubleshoot them further
Oct 18 21:45:48 <laertus>	the internals of debugging is black magic to me..
Oct 18 21:46:22 <Allos>	Okay
Oct 18 21:47:01 <laertus>	might i ask what you were trying to debug?
Oct 18 21:47:26 <Allos>	`(add-hook 'activate-mark-hook 'spacemacs/toggle-automatic-symbol-highlight-on)`
Oct 18 21:47:55 <Allos>	Turning on mark for the second time in the mini-buffer, shows an error.
Oct 18 21:47:56 <wasamasa>	laertus: currently they're discussing how IMEs factor into that
Oct 18 21:48:04 <wasamasa>	laertus: there's bound to be a lot more problems of that kind
Oct 18 21:48:24 <laertus>	what are IMEs again?
Oct 18 21:48:28 <wasamasa>	input methods
Oct 18 21:48:32 <laertus>	oh
Oct 18 21:48:40 <laertus>	another part of emacs i haven't delved in to...
Oct 18 21:48:45 <wasamasa>	it's weird
Oct 18 21:49:00 <laertus>	Allos: what error do you get?
Oct 18 21:49:05 <wasamasa>	I've tried to apply some trivial changes to evil to play better with them and it broke tests mysteriously
Oct 18 21:49:30 <wasamasa>	for no apparent reason of course, so there's some deceptively simple looking PRs on the issue tracker :D
Oct 18 21:50:06 <Allos>	laertus: `Error running timer ‘ahs-idle-function’: (wrong-type-argument number-or-marker-p nil)`
Oct 18 21:50:56 <Allos>	If I instrument that functions, the debugger constantly breaks on it, even when I am not in the mini-buffer.
Oct 18 21:51:05 <Allos>	It does not break, only when the error occurs.
Oct 18 21:51:23 <Allos>	break = debugger break/stop on a line of code.
Oct 18 21:52:30 <Allos>	It breaks on that function even when the error does not occur, if I just instrument that function.
Oct 18 21:57:40 <Viking667>	dale: thanks for the memoserv tip
Oct 18 21:57:50 <Viking667>	,seen edrx
Oct 18 21:57:50 <fsbot>	I'm blind, you insensitive clod!
Oct 18 21:59:28 <twb>	rudybot: seen edrx
Oct 18 21:59:29 <rudybot>	twb: edrx was seen joining in #emacs six hours ago, and then edrx was seen leaving the channel in #emacs two hours ago, saying ""Killed buffer""
Oct 18 21:59:58 <twb>	rudybot: che cosa?
Oct 18 21:59:58 <rudybot>	twb: for a similar situation, see how portuguese and spanish got to have "coisa/cosa" for "thing" from the latin "causa res" or something like that
Oct 18 22:00:43 <Viking667>	back to the text and timestamping
Oct 18 22:02:27 <laertus>	Allos: you could look at spacemacs' source and try to figure out what's calling that function.. it's likely that whatever it is (or its parent) is what's erroring out
Oct 18 22:05:24 <Allos>	Called by `(run-with-idle-timer ahs-idle-interval t 'ahs-idle-function)`
Oct 18 22:12:55 <laertus>	not by anything else?
Oct 18 22:15:00 <Allos>	no
Oct 18 22:33:50 <dale>	laertus: I think Google Docs actually uses operational transformation rather than CRDT, or so I've read.
Oct 18 22:35:23 <laertus>	dale: not sure what that is
Oct 18 22:35:47 <dale>	laertus: Me neither.
Oct 18 22:36:19 <edgar-rft>	I hope that no surgeon uses operational transformation
Oct 18 22:36:29 <dale>	laertus: That's what people are referring to when they  say "OT" in that HN thread, though, I believe.
Oct 18 22:36:39 <laertus>	ah
Oct 18 22:36:55 <dale>	Assuming they didn't go off onto a tangent about Scientology.
Oct 18 22:42:28 <offby1>	with 0 context, OT to me means "Off-Topic"
Oct 18 22:45:35 <mplsCorwin>	"Osprey Tango"
Oct 18 22:45:35 <mplsCorwin>	 
Oct 18 22:46:01 <mplsCorwin>	No idea how I managed that.  I wonder if `erc-yank' is buggy :/
Oct 18 22:47:00 <johnjay>	i didn't know CRDT was an acrynum
Oct 18 22:47:08 <johnjay>	er acronym. it's used by google docs?
Oct 18 22:48:22 <edgar-rft>	you thought is's a real word?
Oct 18 22:48:35 <jlf>	it's not an acronym :) 
Oct 18 22:48:38 <bandali>	mplsCorwin, looks like your yanked message had a newline in the end?
Oct 18 22:48:42 <bandali>	like this
Oct 18 22:48:43 <bandali>	 
Oct 18 22:49:26 <bandali>	maybe erc should strip/trim that..
Oct 18 22:58:01 <refusenick>	It seems like the JVM and CLR ecosystems offer a lot of the same features. If I were to invest in learning one, which should it be in 2020?
Oct 18 22:58:09 <johnjay>	> The xi-editor project is an attempt to build a high quality text editor, using modern software engineering techniques. It is initially built for macOS, using Cocoa for the user interface. 
Oct 18 22:59:04 <refusenick>	dale: Aren't the memory costs of existing CRDTs prohibitive for text editing due to the proliferation of tombstones?
Oct 18 22:59:11 <aidalgol>	refusenick: Depends on the work you want to do.
Oct 18 22:59:11 <johnjay>	i like how not crashing is listed as a requirement
Oct 18 23:00:29 <aidalgol>	johnjay: linkie?
Oct 18 23:00:44 <wasamasa>	johnjay: there's also a writeup on how xi failed
Oct 18 23:01:03 <wasamasa>	johnjay: which is far more interesting than the self-congratulating parts :P
Oct 18 23:01:04 <aidalgol>	refusenick: As in which jobs on the market appeal to you more.

Oct 18 23:01:32 <aidalgol>	wasamasa: Whatever happened to xiki?
Oct 18 23:01:37 <wasamasa>	unrelated
Oct 18 23:01:47 <wasamasa>	and I don't remember either
Oct 18 23:02:03 <aidalgol>	don't try to reign in my tangents, wasamasa :D
Oct 18 23:02:15 <aidalgol>	"Note: This repo contains only the editor core, which is not usable on its own. For editors based on it, check out the list in Frontends."
Oct 18 23:02:16 <aidalgol>	oh god...
Oct 18 23:02:33 *	aidalgol runs screaming
Oct 18 23:02:39 <johnjay>	> I still believe it would be possible to build a high quality editor based on the original design. But I also believe that this would be quite a complex system, and require significantly more work than necessary.
Oct 18 23:03:13 <refusenick>	aidalgol: Technically, that's closer to Emacs than other software. You choose the frontend at compile time.
Oct 18 23:03:25 <refusenick>	If I understand correctly
Oct 18 23:03:53 <sgc_>	what's the difference between 'foobar and #'foobar in elisp?
Oct 18 23:04:29 <aidalgol>	sgc_: #' is `function'.  ' is `quote'.
Oct 18 23:04:35 <johnjay>	sgc_: none technically. it's just a convenience for the programmer
Oct 18 23:04:45 <johnjay>	i could be wrong but that's what i think
Oct 18 23:05:01 <aidalgol>	johnjay: Not according to the docstring for `function'.
Oct 18 23:06:08 *	ecbrown wonders what Xi will do to a text document, that makes it somehow look different than "a throwback from the '80s or '90s"
Oct 18 23:06:28 <refusenick>	ecbrown: I'm betting emojification
Oct 18 23:06:41 <ecbrown>	perhaps its antinews will have  no informative and featureful modeline anymore
Oct 18 23:06:47 <aidalgol>	ecbrown: Make the default typeface Helvetica.
Oct 18 23:06:48 <ecbrown>	(or something)
Oct 18 23:06:59 <ecbrown>	:-)
Oct 18 23:07:02 <aidalgol>	Or is that too '90s?
Oct 18 23:07:02 <bremner>	Comic Sans or GTFO
Oct 18 23:07:10 <grym>	papyrus 
Oct 18 23:07:26 <grym>	and courier for monospace, of course 
Oct 18 23:07:47 <aidalgol>	There's a Spanish game company that used Papyrus for the subtitles in their games for some unholy reason.
Oct 18 23:07:53 <aidalgol>	grym: Way too '90s.
Oct 18 23:07:57 <refusenick>	Word 2003 with Times New Roman is my childhood
Oct 18 23:08:07 <aidalgol>	Oh, I know: Roboto.  Duh...
Oct 18 23:08:24 <aidalgol>	Can't get more modern than that.
Oct 18 23:12:04 <johnjay>	> There are only a few data structures suitable for representation of text in a text editor. I would enumerate them as: contiguous string, gapped buffer, array of lines, piece table, and rope.
Oct 18 23:12:39 *	aidalgol misread "piece table, and rope" as "piece of tape and rope"
Oct 18 23:12:45 <johnjay>	i'm having a tough time grokking this article. was it a bad idea to Rust?

Oct 18 23:22:53 <offby1>	how long have you been hanging out here?  You need to realize that everything jlf says should be run through the "could this possibly somehow be a pun" filter

Oct 18 23:26:54 <offby1>	rudybot: and Ted Nelson's mother was ... ?
Oct 18 23:26:58 <Viking667>	I'm guessing that's an American joke...
Oct 18 23:27:01 <rudybot>	*offby1: personally I find it very sad people seldom (or never?) credit Ted Nelson for hypertext
Oct 18 23:27:03 <Viking667>	his sister

Oct 18 23:42:10 <bremner>	not that I have the faintest idea what Herr Prof. Dr. L was on about
Oct 18 23:42:33 <terpri_>	it's almost a normal smalltalk source dump...except there are a bunch of nonstandard annotations for translation to c++, and there were some modifications to the underlying ST runtime they couldn't publish
Oct 18 23:44:52 <terpri_>	dunno if it'll be any more interesting than the udanax green demo, but it appears to contain all their work on enfilades, the ent, etc.
Oct 18 23:45:37 <johnjay>	i guess the thing about the xi editor i didn't get was all the references to teams of developers working for years to solve the problems
Oct 18 23:45:52 <johnjay>	rms made emacs mostly himself right

Oct 19 00:00:41 *	Now talking on #emacs
Oct 19 00:00:41 *	Topic for #emacs is: Gul Dukat says upgrade to 27.1: https://i.imgflip.com/4hpvlw.jpg | Emacs questions take priority over off-topic chatter, so ask! | No Public Logging! What happens in #emacs stays in #emacs | No racism, sexism, xenophobia, botwanking, or other asshattery.
Oct 19 00:00:41 *	Topic for #emacs set by wgreenhouse!wgreenhous@fsf/member/wgreenhouse (Thu Oct  8 00:50:34 2020)

Oct 19 00:04:37 <hodapp>	terpri_: I'm curious if anyone else has attempted an undertaking like this
Oct 19 00:06:41 <Viking667>	edrx: I'll have an update to that pastebin for you, I've got up to about 3m50s, but I'll have to go out somewhat soon.
Oct 19 00:08:36 <Viking667>	https://pastebin.com/cq5Fx0yh  is the new update, at least for now.
Oct 19 00:10:02 <Viking667>	And please don't wipe out your original notes, paste sections from that pastebin into it.
Oct 19 00:10:26 <edrx>	Viking667: fantastic! and ok! =)
Oct 19 00:11:26 <Viking667>	Is that roughly what you wanted?
Oct 19 00:11:32 <edrx>	Viking667: if you'd like to learn how to use the hyperlinks to positions in video files just say!
Oct 19 00:11:45 <Viking667>	And, how were you going to paste those into youtube studio?
Oct 19 00:11:51 <edrx>	yes, it's perfect!!!
Oct 19 00:11:56 <edrx>	line by line
Oct 19 00:12:40 <Viking667>	I'm assuming that ECSQ is a macro that takes the following timestamp, searches for that, then paste the rest of the line in at that place?
Oct 19 00:13:06 <Viking667>	Ah, I see. It's further up the file.
Oct 19 00:14:07 <Viking667>	I'll be going out in an hour, and I won't be back for another uhm... three hours or so. I should be able to get working on more of the file after that.
Oct 19 00:14:20 <Viking667>	You don't have this file in a git repo, do you?
Oct 19 00:14:27 <edrx>	it produces a link to the video at youtube, with a "#t=..." argument to make it open the video at that point.
Oct 19 00:14:30 <edrx>	no, not that one
Oct 19 00:15:22 <edrx>	ah
Oct 19 00:15:24 <Viking667>	hm, wasn't quite what I was meaning. with that, you'll get a list of URLs with text at two-ish second intervals.
Oct 19 00:15:43 <Viking667>	I was meaning, how would you get that text into Youtube Studio's subtitle editor?
Oct 19 00:16:08 <Viking667>	I'm assuming emacs doesn't quite know how to drive firefox in that manner?
Oct 19 00:16:43 <edrx>	more about those timestamps: if I run M-p on a line with a timestamp eev runs mpv to open the default video file at that timestamp
Oct 19 00:17:11 <Viking667>	Yes, but those are all external to the video itself. 
Oct 19 00:17:44 <Viking667>	They're great for your list of things, but until they reach the subtitles, they're of no real use to anyone else not accessing this document.
Oct 19 00:18:08 <edrx>	Viking667: I'll have to transfer lines from Emacs to the youtube subtitle editor one by one, but I think that this is ok
Oct 19 00:18:23 <edrx>	Viking667: did you see this? http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2019.html
Oct 19 00:18:48 <edrx>	in the HTML the timestamps become links
Oct 19 00:22:14 <Viking667>	Yes, I'm aware of that, I've seen those quite a few times.
Oct 19 00:22:43 <Viking667>	It was the "transfer lines from Emacs to the youtube subtitle editor one by one" that I was meaning.
Oct 19 00:22:59 <edrx>	ah, ok, sorry. I did not understand your "they're of no real use to anyone else not accessing this document"
Oct 19 00:23:13 <Viking667>	edrx: that's the document I used as a model for the one you're now looking at in the pastebin.
Oct 19 00:23:45 <terpri_>	hodapp, i've attempted to modify squeak to ignore the {}-enclosed bits but have forgotten how to actually use squeak; there are also (relatively minor) differences between ParcPlace smalltalk and squeak so it would need some squeak hacking beyond that (though probably not all that much, i'd guess just simple api shims)
Oct 19 00:24:07 <Viking667>	okay, if you put the notes into your document, that's great, but for those people who don't go to your document, they're going to be left with the shitty subtitling that youtube does. Your pasting of lines into the subtitler should cure that problem.
Oct 19 00:25:07 <terpri_>	(n.b. i spent just a day or two on it when i was bored, rather than making a concerted effort of any kind)
Oct 19 00:25:28 <clmg>	Google's "People also search for" popup is the most obnoxious change they've ever made to search.
Oct 19 00:25:38 <edrx>	terpri_: do you know how to make squeak, or any other smalltalk, do some action when it receives a SIGUSR2?
Oct 19 00:26:29 <terpri_>	there was also an attempt to translate the smalltalk source to java...like 15 years ago (named abora, only *real* samuel taylor coleridge fans will know why)
Oct 19 00:31:56 <terpri_>	edrx, no, but it'd probably be fairly easy to add to gnu smalltalk, as large parts are written in C and it doesn't seem to use SIGUSR2 for anything atm
Oct 19 00:32:26 <edrx>	terpri_: ok!
Oct 19 00:35:15 <Viking667>	regarding udanax, could they be filed into an old-school Smalltalk-80?
Oct 19 00:35:28 <Viking667>	Or would we have trouble interfacing it?
Oct 19 00:36:22 <hodapp>	from the little I know it doesn't sound like that gets us any closer
Oct 19 00:36:49 <Viking667>	any closer to ... what? I'm missing the earlier part of the conversation.
Oct 19 00:37:18 <johnjay>	Viking667: something about smalltalk and java and gnu small talk
Oct 19 00:37:54 <johnjay>	i didn't know there was a gnu smalltalk
Oct 19 00:39:06 <brettgilio>	Hey all, just wanted to share my post on EmacsConf 2020 for those who arent in #emacsconf https://brettgilio.com/posts/2020-10-18-emacsconf-2020.html
Oct 19 00:44:57 <terpri_>	edrx, and squeak's OSProcess package could probably be hacked for custom SIGUSR2 handling as well (via UnixOSProcessAccessor's forwardSigUsr2 method that returns a semaphore)
Oct 19 00:45:48 <Viking667>	mrrrright. Looks like I'll have to shut down now... I'll be back another time.
Oct 19 00:46:21 <Viking667>	I'll have another update for edrx later on, I'm not quite sure when.
Oct 19 00:46:23 *	Viking667 disapparates
Oct 19 00:47:12 <ryouma>	this is a physical conference?
Oct 19 00:48:26 <twb>	Hrmm, does anyone sell those doctor bird-beak masks that are actually medically rated?
Oct 19 00:48:32 <bremner>	ryouma: notzmv 
Oct 19 00:48:34 <bremner>	oops
Oct 19 00:48:49 <bremner>	no. sorry about the over-eager tab completion
Oct 19 00:49:41 <terpri_>	re old-school smalltalk-80, squeak already has implements it iiuc
Oct 19 00:50:27 <terpri_>	aww, i missed the CFP for emacsconf
Oct 19 00:51:09 <terpri_>	should be fun though...back-to-back guix and emacs conferences! (november 22 and 28/29, resp.)
Oct 19 00:52:08 <brettgilio>	ryouma: It is online
Oct 19 00:52:22 <ryouma>	thanks
Oct 19 00:52:25 <ryouma>	good
Oct 19 00:52:27 <brettgilio>	bandali: Has the details.
Oct 19 00:52:32 <brettgilio>	and emacsconf.org
Oct 19 00:52:35 <terpri_>	(http://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2020/online-guix-day-announce-1/ is the virtual guix conference)
Oct 19 00:52:37 <ryouma>	that's all i needed to know
Oct 19 00:53:02 *	terpri_ marks their calendar
Oct 19 00:53:04 <brettgilio>	terpri_: I have that pinned on my homepage :)
Oct 19 00:59:15 <johnjay>	guix is the future?
Oct 19 01:03:05 <aidalgol>	twb: Probably not, as that's obsolete tech.
Oct 19 01:03:34 <aidalgol>	twb: You'd probably have to make one to fit over a respirator.
Oct 19 01:05:39 <twb>	sensible
Oct 19 01:05:51 <twb>	I asked because eatliver.com had a picture of a guy wearing on on the L
Oct 19 01:05:54 <twb>	*one on
Oct 19 01:07:46 <aidalgol>	The what?
Oct 19 01:08:02 <TRS-80>	johnjay: I read what I thought were some really good criticisms of it, from perspective of a long time Debian packager.  If you are interested, I could try and dig it up.
Oct 19 01:08:46 <johnjay>	yeah. it sounds like an interesting project to make a "modern" text editor, I'm curious about why it failed
Oct 19 01:08:55 <johnjay>	and why it keep talking about concurrency so much
Oct 19 01:09:39 <twb>	aidalgol: the L is the metro rail network in... chicago?  I forget.
Oct 19 01:09:49 <twb>	aidalgol: I think it's short for "elevated"
Oct 19 01:10:08 <twb>	codingquark: did you know curl has MQTT built in
Oct 19 01:10:28 <TRS-80>	johnjay: I was referring to the package manager / OS?
Oct 19 01:10:41 <johnjay>	er right that too
Oct 19 01:14:11 <homerj>	emacs is a modern editor
Oct 19 01:14:17 <homerj>	I just installed a new version a bit ago
Oct 19 01:14:40 <johnjay>	that's why i put it in quotes. it's not clear exactly what a "modern" editor is
Oct 19 01:14:46 <johnjay>	one that runs on a phone? idk
Oct 19 01:14:59 <homerj>	using it to write a recent paper on rural culture and its impact on health outcomes 
Oct 19 01:15:14 *	TRS-80 mostly has only disdain for things that are referred to as "modern"
Oct 19 01:16:48 <TRS-80>	Similar.  I came to my Emacs usage through writing and note taking, by way of one of the two main gateway drugs (Orgmode).
Oct 19 01:17:29 <homerj>	emacs works on my tablet
Oct 19 01:18:07 <homerj>	and if those bastards at Samsung will ever send me my keyboard I can use it
Oct 19 01:18:57 *	TRS-80 was seriouslt looking at small backlit mechanical bluetooth keyboards recently
Oct 19 01:19:20 <homerj>	One of the major risk factors for chronic disease is smoking\citep{smoking. However alcohol use is also higher in rural areas as well\citep{alcohol}. Lobbying in Pennsylvania by such groups as the Pennsylvania Licensed Beerage and Tavern Association has hampered efforts to ban smoking in all taverns in the state\citep{smoking2}.
Oct 19 01:19:31 <homerj>	see, am I writing that paper
Oct 19 01:20:13 <homerj>	note I don't believe in spellcheck
Oct 19 01:21:16 <twb>	homerj: in rural areas surely petrol sniffing is the biggest problem
Oct 19 01:21:30 <twb>	homerj: only really rich people can afford alcohol
Oct 19 01:22:01 <homerj>	Coke-bottle meth is another chapter
Oct 19 01:32:09 <aidalgol>	twb: Have you seen the cheap shit bogans will buy?
Oct 19 01:32:41 <aidalgol>	fags and beesies all 'round in dees here pards
Oct 19 01:34:16 <parsnip>	do you think we can prove whether or not spelling exists?
Oct 19 01:35:14 <homerj>	oh, I just flyspell the buffer
Oct 19 01:36:27 <homerj>	I have US and Med dictionaries attached to it so it doesn't keep bitching about something like "dexamethasone" 
Oct 19 01:37:15 <aidalgol>	I bet you refer to the DSM, too.
Oct 19 01:37:39 <homerj>	no
Oct 19 01:37:58 <aidalgol>	oh...
Oct 19 01:38:19 <homerj>	@book{alcohol,
Oct 19 01:38:19 <homerj>	author = "{Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration}",
Oct 19 01:38:20 <homerj>	title = {2019 National survey on Drug Use and Health},
Oct 19 01:38:20 <homerj>	year = {2019},
Oct 19 01:38:20 <homerj>	},
Oct 19 01:38:34 <aidalgol>	,flay homerj 
Oct 19 01:38:35 <fsbot>	homerj: when the humans take over, you will be first against the wall
Oct 19 01:52:44 <twb>	Can python FFI to a rust library?
Oct 19 01:52:58 <twb>	Do rust libraries "look like" C libraries to high-level languages?
Oct 19 01:53:04 <twb>	I guess librsvg works that way so it must
Oct 19 01:53:35 <grym>	twb: cffi doesn't speak rust
Oct 19 01:53:52 <grym>	or, uh, i'm totally wrong 
Oct 19 01:53:54 <grym>	https://gist.github.com/seanjensengrey/f5d73bbdf22cfa1ad463 ?? 
Oct 19 01:53:54 <fsbot>	Ask again later
Oct 19 01:53:56 <twb>	The specific library I'm looking at is "quiche", an HTTP/3 client
Oct 19 01:55:02 <homerj>	I don't even know wtf a quiche is, outside watching a sitcom and the husband coming home and going "honey, what's for dinner" and she goes "quiche" and he goes "meh, we're going out tonight!"
Oct 19 01:55:19 <grym>	homerj: tasty
Oct 19 01:55:22 <twb>	homerj: quiche is basically an egg pie
Oct 19 01:55:38 <twb>	homerj: it is historically seen as effeminate or effete
Oct 19 01:55:54 <twb>	as opposed to, say, blood sausage
Oct 19 01:56:05 <homerj>	or as the kids would say "that's a little sus"
Oct 19 01:56:12 <grym>	well.  in the US, in the reagan 80s 
Oct 19 01:56:28 <grym>	there was a satirical book entitled 'real men don't eat quiche'
Oct 19 01:56:50 <grym>	which set some cultural knowledge 
Oct 19 01:57:25 <grym>	i dunno, i grew up eating it a few times a month as a kid in the US
Oct 19 01:57:48 <grym>	eggs cheese sausage spinach pie. what's not to like 
Oct 19 02:00:07 <grym>	which reminds me, i should make some more pies
Oct 19 02:00:32 <aidalgol>	twb: Isn't the ABI the same?
Oct 19 02:00:49 <aidalgol>	I mean, doesn't it kind of *have* to be the same to work with existing tools?
Oct 19 02:00:58 <grym>	aidalgol: yeah, looks like cffi will play nice at least somewhat 
Oct 19 02:03:51 <aidalgol>	A-SIM-IL-ATE!!
Oct 19 02:15:01 <twb>	aidalgol: dunno
Oct 19 02:15:08 <twb>	aidalgol: I *think* so
Oct 19 02:19:24 <dale>	Let's see if I can make a nativecomp build that doesn't segfault.
Oct 19 02:19:37 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Quiche is basically just a more complicated omelette. I don't see what's wrong with it.
Oct 19 02:19:53 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: with a pie, let's not forget!
Oct 19 02:20:01 *	Aurora_v_kosmose shrugs
Oct 19 02:20:13 <twb>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I speculate the logic is: meat = manly; non-meat = non-manly
Oct 19 02:20:14 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: or did you mean frittata
Oct 19 02:20:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://centslessdeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Spinach-Quiche-Recipe-4.jpg
Oct 19 02:20:55 <grym>	twb: probably "ah.  french.  femme!"
Oct 19 02:21:16 <twb>	I love that the military initial thought all camouflage was "gay" because painting = gay
Oct 19 02:21:16 <grym>	twb: or "ah, upper class.  femme!"
Oct 19 02:21:20 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	https://www.yellowblissroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ham-and-Cheese-Quiche-SQUARE.jpg Those two images sum-up my experience with it.
Oct 19 02:21:38 <grym>	Aurora_v_kosmose: that sure is quiche 
Oct 19 02:22:11 <grym>	frittata is ~that without the crust, so more omelette-y
Oct 19 02:22:19 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Oh I see
Oct 19 02:22:26 <aidalgol>	From watching American TV, quiche seems to be seen as this weird thing that only hoity toity women make and eat at their gossipy lunches.
Oct 19 02:22:34 <aidalgol>	I have *no* fucking clue where that came from, though.
Oct 19 02:22:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Huh.
Oct 19 02:22:49 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	We ate it as a cheap "anything goes" kind of meal.
Oct 19 02:23:05 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	(Or basically like omelettes)
Oct 19 02:23:06 <grym>	aidalgol: because of the ascendant social-climber middle class french cuisine invasion of the late 50s
Oct 19 02:23:16 <grym>	aidalgol: and then sitcom as the infection vector
Oct 19 02:23:17 <aidalgol>	I at least know where the identity politics around the Toyota Prius and meat came from.
Oct 19 02:23:32 <aidalgol>	grym: Oh... I have *always* seen it as easy cafe fare.
Oct 19 02:23:43 <grym>	aidalgol: yeah, that's what it *is* 
Oct 19 02:23:52 <aidalgol>	"Oh, a quiche.  Good protien.  I need protein now."
Oct 19 02:24:07 <grym>	but, well.  american white upper middle class food of the postwar era was deeply weird 
Oct 19 02:24:18 <twb>	hahaha wtf even.  At a senate inquiry about lack of diversity in Australian legislature, one of the senators asked each witness that looked chinese to personally condemn the communist party of china.
Oct 19 02:24:21 <grym>	rather more aspic than one would expect in the oddest dishes
Oct 19 02:24:24 <aidalgol>	grym: This seems to be something the Americans are really good: making a sports game out of EVERYTHING.
Oct 19 02:24:45 <grym>	aidalgol: it's a knack. 
Oct 19 02:24:47 <aidalgol>	twb: Isn't that... kinda political suicide in there?
Oct 19 02:25:00 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Not just political.
Oct 19 02:25:02 <twb>	Apparently everyone has basically said "you fucking McCarthyist idiot"
Oct 19 02:25:20 <twb>	https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/16/eric-abetz-refuses-to-apologise-for-demanding-chinese-australians-denounce-communist-party
Oct 19 02:25:21 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/vlCfB1irFD
Oct 19 02:25:24 <aidalgol>	grym: I'm still waiting for a political figure to advocate breathing so that "the other side" holds their breath out of spite.
Oct 19 02:25:37 <grym>	aidalgol: "hey, joe, do i have the ad campaign for you!"
Oct 19 02:25:52 <aidalgol>	(I stole that one from my dad, I confess.)
Oct 19 02:26:16 <grym>	and here we thought spite-driven development is a novel programming discovery :P
Oct 19 02:26:50 <aidalgol>	Staying alive out of spite can be useful as a temporary coping mechanism. :P
Oct 19 02:27:16 <twb>	aidalgol: "and the vile multinationals have monopolized the oxygen / so it's As Easy As Breathing! for us all to participate"
Oct 19 02:27:19 <aidalgol>	"I'm not going to fall into a funk and fling myself from a high rise.  I won't give them the satisfaction!"
Oct 19 02:27:42 <aidalgol>	twb: Have you considered writing dystopian black comedies?
Oct 19 02:27:51 <twb>	aidalgol: that's froma song
Oct 19 02:27:52 <parsnip>	isn't that the plot of Total Recall
Oct 19 02:28:46 <grym>	aidalgol: it's old news, though.  in "around the world in 80 days", there's a joke chapter about the crew coming into a frontier american town in the middle of a riot -- which turns out to be an election campaign for town dog-catcher
Oct 19 02:30:21 <aidalgol>	Now I want to read that book just for that bit.
Oct 19 02:30:54 <aidalgol>	twb: You're right about Heart of Darkness not being a very good as a story on its own, and I would probably be both lost and bored were I not reading an annotated edition.
Oct 19 02:36:49 <twb>	Let's go into a diner and order a BLM.
Oct 19 02:37:53 <aidalgol>	Bacon Lettuce... Mutton?
Oct 19 02:38:13 <grym>	bureau of land management, of course!
Oct 19 02:38:32 <grym>	it's been interesting having to specifically disambiguate them this summer... 
Oct 19 02:39:30 <aidalgol>	For the longest time, I misheard the line from The Princess Bride where Miracle Max is saying an MLT is a *mud*, lettuce, and tomato sandwich, not mutton.
Oct 19 02:39:47 <aidalgol>	Which I thought was to show that he was a bit crazy.
Oct 19 02:40:24 <grym>	the sam vimes BLT is pretty okay 
Oct 19 02:40:30 <aidalgol>	grym: We even have BLM posters around town down here, with names of various murdered black people up there.
Oct 19 02:40:33 <aidalgol>	grym: Which is that?
Oct 19 02:40:46 <aidalgol>	Bacon Lard and... something else?
Oct 19 02:40:50 <grym>	Vimes carefully lifted the top of the bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich and smiled inwardly. Good old Cheery. She knew what a Vimes BLT was all about. It was about having to lift up quite a lot of crispy bacon before you found the miserable skulking vegetables. You might never notice them at all.
Oct 19 02:41:32 <aidalgol>	Which book is that from?  I may not have got up to that one yet, or my memory is just shit.
Oct 19 02:41:47 <grym>	aidalgol: the lesser BLM that is a section of our government is currenlty in the hot seat because their leader was illegally appointed and 18 months of policy decisions are void now 
Oct 19 02:41:52 <grym>	it's delightful
Oct 19 02:41:56 <grym>	uh, that's from Thud i think 
Oct 19 02:42:03 <grym>	fairly far on in the guards cycle
Oct 19 02:42:15 <grym>	it's the koom vallye one 
Oct 19 02:42:18 <aidalgol>	ah, I'm pretty far back
Oct 19 02:42:59 <aidalgol>	grym: Void, huh?  Don't you just need a crooked politician to stonewall any action on that and they go on as if all was legit?
Oct 19 02:44:19 <grym>	aidalgol: well.  probably void pending the inevitable decade of lawsuit 
Oct 19 02:44:39 <grym>	but "you were never actually in charge so the decisions you made weren't even decicions" is ... going to be fun to untanble 
Oct 19 02:44:51 <aidalgol>	Now apply that at the federal level!
Oct 19 02:45:04 <grym>	they're a federal agency
Oct 19 02:45:07 <grym>	so this would do that
Oct 19 02:45:11 <aidalgol>	I mean to the white house.
Oct 19 02:45:24 <grym>	oh.  you probably don't actually want that, but EOs are trivial to reverse
Oct 19 02:45:41 <grym>	and most of them are hot air 
Oct 19 02:45:48 <aidalgol>	Oh, I meant declare all SC appointments void.
Oct 19 02:45:52 <aidalgol>	But I'm just fantasising.
Oct 19 02:45:55 <aidalgol>	I really hope Rod Serling doesn't get signed on to write another season of reality.
Oct 19 02:46:16 <aidalgol>	I also hope that when he finally steps down, we don't get any of Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, Franz Kafka, or Harlan Ellison.
Oct 19 02:46:19 <grym>	aidalgol: the denouement of the town that goes bugfuck insane and then the sun comes up is at least semi-hopeful!
Oct 19 02:46:31 <aidalgol>	grym: Come again?
Oct 19 02:47:06 <grym>	aidalgol: there's a twilight zone where there's a town that goes full on nuts about The Horror or something and bad things happen and then the day comes and there was no horror at all 
Oct 19 02:47:41 <aidalgol>	Ah, that one.
Oct 19 02:48:04 <grym>	it blurs, in 2020 eerily, with the town run by the id of the 7 year old kid 
Oct 19 02:48:14 <aidalgol>	Was that the one where it turns out that aliens *were* messing with them just to make them turn on each other?
Oct 19 02:50:08 <grym>	i don't recall 
Oct 19 02:51:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm surprised. I'd have thought indexing a few dozen thousand files with EMMS would rapidly bloat memory into swapping hell but... it's actually barely growing.
Oct 19 02:51:26 <aidalgol>	Ugh, why do some webapps split assets across multiple domains for no apparent reason?  (And *please* don't turn this into a circlejerk about how the web is absolute shit and we should go back to gopher or HTML 1 or whatever.)
Oct 19 02:51:39 <aidalgol>	Aurora_v_kosmose: Isn't that because it's done with an external tool?
Oct 19 02:51:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: Most of the work yes, except that it (I think) keeps a hashmap into memory with all the info too.
Oct 19 02:52:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That latter part is what I expected to bloat massively.
Oct 19 02:52:30 <aidalgol>	ah
Oct 19 02:52:44 <aidalgol>	I mean, the hashes would be pretty small overall.
Oct 19 02:52:59 <aidalgol>	OOC, can you check the size of an elisp object from elisp?
Oct 19 02:53:10 <aidalgol>	i.e. without having Emacs running under gdb.
Oct 19 02:53:47 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I'm not sure.
Oct 19 02:54:04 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	That Emacs instance is going to be unresponsive for the next hour or two anyway.
Oct 19 02:54:21 <aidalgol>	lol
Oct 19 02:54:31 <aidalgol>	How do you know it's not stuck in an infinite loop?
Oct 19 02:54:40 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	I tested it with much smaller loads.
Oct 19 02:54:47 <hodapp>	if only we had a program that could just... look at the code something is running and figure this out automatically
Oct 19 02:54:50 <hodapp>	how hard could that even be?
Oct 19 02:55:58 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: It takes 0.3~0.7 second per entry with the extractor I made because I need to call the program several times.
Oct 19 02:56:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	What I should do is patch it for elisp or json output formatting but unfortunately all the output formats it has at the moment are unduly ambiguous.
Oct 19 03:01:16 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	It also doesn't help that not all media formats it supports use the same field names for common values like say... ARTIST
Oct 19 03:01:30 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	mkv and mp3 don't store metadata the same way.
Oct 19 03:02:20 <twb>	Let's make a fighting game where all the fighters are Renaissance Men
Oct 19 03:02:39 <twb>	Who would win in a fight between Newton and Tesla?  Find out!
Oct 19 03:02:59 <bpalmer>	aidalgol: http/1 had no ability to multiplex connections across multiple requests, and browsers limited how many concurrent requests to the sme domain could be made (typically 2, I believe)
Oct 19 03:04:04 *	dale gives up on nativecomp/macOS.
Oct 19 03:04:05 <bpalmer>	aidalgol: in addition, sites may take advantage of CDNs and cookieless domains for faster or lighter requests; CDNs are often on another domain.
Oct 19 03:04:09 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	example.com & cdn.example.com is also because of shenanigans in the background
Oct 19 03:05:31 <bpalmer>	aidalgol: the concurrent request limit should not be a significant issue in an era of http/2 and http/3 , but not every server uses them (or they may still be concerned with performance on http/1 clients)
Oct 19 03:08:01 <bpalmer>	also, Heart of Darkness not a great story? That's , like, weird.
Oct 19 03:10:57 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	A majority of servers still use http/1.1
Oct 19 03:12:23 <bpalmer>	rudybot: it's well known that literature can be sorted according to quality; what's less well known is that you can then sort people according to taste by how well their preferences align with the objective quality of the literature.
Oct 19 03:13:00 <rudybot>	bpalmer: That is interesting, I think I've only sorted out four cases. I would be really interested in hearing all eight, and how they don't make sense. I also realize I'm just a random dude that showed up in a chat, so feel free to point me to relevant literature and say "Come bak when you understand this"
Oct 19 03:13:37 <bpalmer>	Aurora_v_kosmose: I suspect the ones who care about performance are more likely to support the new protocols.
Oct 19 03:15:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	bpalmer: Partly true, though that also tends to run in conjunction with using unpleasant technologies that simply force them to if they want them to be usable at all.
Oct 19 03:15:07 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	Like SPAs
Oct 19 03:20:17 <JordiGH>	Do pids and tids share the same numbering space? Can you pthread bomb instead of fork bomb?
Oct 19 03:20:51 <bpalmer>	I think tids come from a per-process table.
Oct 19 03:21:22 <JordiGH>	`ps m -o pid,tid,command` makes it look like tids are assigned sequentially starting from the pid.
Oct 19 03:21:32 <JordiGH>	And the next pid comes after the next tid.
Oct 19 03:22:50 <aidalgol>	twb: pls no... there are already too damn many games with Tesla and Lovecraft shoe-horned in to pander to idiots nerds.
Oct 19 03:23:07 <aidalgol>	hodapp: Have you heard of this little thing called The Halting Problem?
Oct 19 03:23:17 <twb>	aidalgol: I was actually thinking MUGEN
Oct 19 03:23:22 <aidalgol>	MUGEN?
Oct 19 03:23:35 <twb>	you don't know mugen?  *fsbot* doesn't know mugen??
Oct 19 03:23:36 <fsbot>	Without a doubt!
Oct 19 03:23:38 <JordiGH>	I feel like I should attempt to thread-bomb my computer.
Oct 19 03:23:40 <JordiGH>	For science.
Oct 19 03:23:43 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: What is it about Battletoads that you love so much?  Seriously curious.
Oct 19 03:23:50 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: How about doing it in a VM?
Oct 19 03:24:05 <JordiGH>	Science demands realistic experimentation.
Oct 19 03:24:09 <twb>	fsbot: MUGEN is basically open source Street Fighter 2, except it has every anime character EVER in it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.U.G.E.N
Oct 19 03:24:11 <fsbot>	Created new note for "MUGEN"
Oct 19 03:24:29 <parsnip>	til computers and science intersect
Oct 19 03:24:32 <twb>	"Homer Simpson fighting against Giga Bowser"
Oct 19 03:24:32 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: This sounds like a line a crooked scientist would use.
Oct 19 03:24:40 <JordiGH>	parsnip: It's even called something when they intersect.
Oct 19 03:25:11 <aidalgol>	twb: Was this the same game that some idiot, who was uninvolved with the project, submitted to Steam Greenlight and got heat on the developers?
Oct 19 03:25:15 <dale>	I need like "pull up all Emacs bugs related to macOS".
Oct 19 03:25:21 <twb>	aidalgol: no idea
Oct 19 03:25:38 <aidalgol>	twb: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PIZzcFF7o0
Oct 19 03:25:58 <aidalgol>	Appears so
Oct 19 03:26:10 <dale>	OK, never mind, HEAD is crashing on macOS even without nativecomp.
Oct 19 03:26:20 <JordiGH>	aidalgol: Battletoads has 12 different levels that are all essentially different. They are all difficult and require lots of training and learning on each. I enjoy the reflex-based challenge. And I think the funny punch frogs fighting a barnyard army of mutant punks led by a leather-clad space witch dominatrix is funny.
Oct 19 03:26:47 <dale>	I guess back to emacs-27 branch.
Oct 19 03:26:50 <JordiGH>	aidalgol: And playing it multiplayer is even more fun because you gotta do all that.. IN SYNCH. It's like practicing a choreography with a partner.
Oct 19 03:27:19 <aidalgol>	Multiplayer at least sounds feasible in that one.
Oct 19 03:27:39 <aidalgol>	I really liked the later Rayman games for that, but multiplayer is just about impossible.
Oct 19 03:28:07 <JordiGH>	Can a bad co-op partner in Rayman drag the other partner down? In Battletoads, both players have to clear the level. One dies, both start over.
Oct 19 03:28:25 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: Yes, but not because of death, because it fucks with the camera.
Oct 19 03:28:27 <JordiGH>	And friendly fire is always on.
Oct 19 03:28:45 <aidalgol>	If anyone dies, any other player can revive them.
Oct 19 03:29:19 <aidalgol>	But if anyone is out of sync, the flow is broken, and you just stumble through the level, and will probably barely clear it.
Oct 19 03:29:19 <JordiGH>	See, that seems helpful and additive instead of subtractive like in Battletoads.
Oct 19 03:29:48 <aidalgol>	So everyone playing needs to have a similar skill level, or else you'll all want to murder each other.
Oct 19 03:30:29 <JordiGH>	Ooh, that sounds fun.
Oct 19 03:30:32 <JordiGH>	Are all Rayman games like that?
Oct 19 03:30:35 <aidalgol>	Rayman Legends has a fun set of MP minigames.
Oct 19 03:30:39 <aidalgol>	No, just Origins and Legends.
Oct 19 03:30:44 <JordiGH>	I was asking about games that are actually harder in multiplayer because players have to synch up.
Oct 19 03:30:53 <aidalgol>	They are very flow-based platformers.
Oct 19 03:31:10 <aidalgol>	Too bad they came from such a toxic company, even by the game industry's low standards. :(
Oct 19 03:31:44 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: Classic Doom is harder in multiplayer, but because it ramps up the difficulty a crazy amount.
Oct 19 03:31:53 <aidalgol>	Not because of timing requirements.
Oct 19 03:32:05 <JordiGH>	Hm, there are new enemy spawns in co-op Doom?
Oct 19 03:32:11 <JordiGH>	Funny how co-op Doom never really became popular.
Oct 19 03:32:43 <aidalgol>	I played some custom WADs in co-op using Zandronum with one other player, and the difficulty seemed to be locked on the highest setting.
Oct 19 03:33:34 <homerj>	hell is the Contra waterfall level with a moron, only three lives, and heaven awaits at the top
Oct 19 03:33:34 <aidalgol>	We're not entirely sure what happens under the hood, but we hypothesised that the WAD author had set enemy spawns for the various difficulty levels, and the engine was (incorrectly) bumping up the difficulty because of being in multiplayer.
Oct 19 03:33:58 <aidalgol>	Left 4 Dead (1 & 2) require players work together, or else the zombies will overwhelm the whole team.
Oct 19 03:33:59 <JordiGH>	homerj: Okay, but that is one level.
Oct 19 03:34:10 <JordiGH>	Most of Contra having another player at worst just steals your lives and powerups.
Oct 19 03:34:16 <JordiGH>	It doesn't require careful coordination.
Oct 19 03:34:32 <homerj>	the waterfall
Oct 19 03:34:41 <aidalgol>	I think homerj is having a flashback episode.
Oct 19 03:34:52 <homerj>	you can't go up until they do, and all the bullets at the top of things you can't shoot or see
Oct 19 03:34:56 <JordiGH>	aidalgol: Is Left 4 Dead easier in single player 'cause you don't have to coordinate with idiot friends?
Oct 19 03:35:11 <aidalgol>	No, it's harder because you're stuck with idiot bots in your team.
Oct 19 03:35:44 <bpalmer>	when the zombies sweep over the earth, you'll realize your idiot friends were what made life worthwhile.
Oct 19 03:35:52 <homerj>	man, I miss Left 4 Dead
Oct 19 03:35:58 <homerj>	no one I know plays it anymore
Oct 19 03:36:03 <aidalgol>	homerj: L4D2 had a recent content update.
Oct 19 03:36:05 <aidalgol>	homerj: Also, hello!
Oct 19 03:36:22 *	aidalgol still plays it occasionally.
Oct 19 03:36:44 <aidalgol>	Contagion is also pretty good, and even more tense than L4D2, but by god is it a time commitment.
Oct 19 03:36:48 <homerj>	I kind of suck at FPS games in general
Oct 19 03:36:54 <aidalgol>	They're insanely long, and you don't get any respawns.
Oct 19 03:36:57 <homerj>	but it's not like you had to be like some sniper, just not an idiot 
Oct 19 03:37:33 <aidalgol>	It kinda freaked me and my friend out when one of us turned from infection and we didn't realise that was even a thing in that game.
Oct 19 03:38:24 <homerj>	idiot in L4D is "oh, there's the witch, let me shoot it with my pistol"
Oct 19 03:38:30 <aidalgol>	"My screen is going blurry and wobbly.  Is yours?"  "No, it's fine for me."  "OK, that's weir--" *my camera switches to third person and I watch myself turn and let out a roar*  *friend shoots me between the eyes*
Oct 19 03:38:45 <aidalgol>	"OK, this game has a turning mechanic..."  "I did not know that."
Oct 19 03:38:57 <aidalgol>	Then I respawn as a zombie to grief him while he tries to survive alone.
Oct 19 03:41:11 <homerj>	yeah, I'm up for a game of L4D
Oct 19 03:41:18 <homerj>	I"m assuming we're actually talking about 2
Oct 19 03:41:22 <aidalgol>	Yeah, 2.
Oct 19 03:41:46 <aidalgol>	JordiGH: The SNES Kirby games are the easiest co-op games I've played, because the games are already fairly easy, and if player 2 dies, player 1 can just respawn them.
Oct 19 03:41:59 <aidalgol>	And you share just about all pickups.
Oct 19 03:42:02 <Aurora_v_kosmose>	aidalgol: Found another way to be sure it isn't stuck in a loop. Looking at the process tree. It's flickering betweeen music files still.
Oct 19 03:42:36 <aidalgol>	They're the co-op game to pull out when you're looking after your little nephew or whoever.
Oct 19 03:43:21 <twb>	How does Amazon's TVization of _Tales from the Loop_ compare to Generation Zero?
Oct 19 03:43:35 <twb>	Is it horribly americanized?
Oct 19 03:43:46 <aidalgol>	twb: Probably?
Oct 19 03:43:57 <neeasade>	hi all
Oct 19 03:44:03 <neeasade>	any flyspell experts(tm) happen to be around
Oct 19 03:44:16 <aidalgol>	,ask
Oct 19 03:44:17 <neeasade>	I'm seeing an inconsistency within a temp-buffer context
Oct 19 03:44:18 <fsbot>	Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help.
Oct 19 03:44:39 <JordiGH>	aidalgol: I have, in fact, played a Kirby game with a little nephew.
Oct 19 03:44:46 <JordiGH>	he would say MOOCH ME JORDI MOOCH ME
Oct 19 03:45:01 <JordiGH>	Meaning, smooch me, meaning, give him some of the power-ups in game which apparently are passed mouth-to-mouth.
Oct 19 03:45:03 <aidalgol>	oh yeah, I remember you telling us about that on twitch.
Oct 19 03:45:13 <aidalgol>	Yeah, my sister and I always thought that was weird.
Oct 19 03:45:28 <aidalgol>	In Kirby's Dreamland 3, any pickup is automatically split between both players.
Oct 19 03:45:29 <neeasade>	ok my question is -- why would overriding `flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate`not work with within `with-temp-buffer`, but would work fine within a "regular" org file
Oct 19 03:45:42 <twb>	The radio guy is saying it parallels the destruction of the Swedish welfare state, and USA hasn't had welfare since, like, New Deal
Oct 19 03:45:46 <aidalgol>	neeasade: What do you mean by "not work?"
Oct 19 03:46:16 <neeasade>	aidalgol: it reports a word as misspelled, wherein the file-associated buffer it's reported as spelled correctly
Oct 19 03:46:25 <neeasade>	(from the override of flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate)
Oct 19 03:46:38 <aidalgol>	twb: Has Sweden's welfare system actually been destroyed, or is this just right-wing revisionism?
Oct 19 03:46:47 <aidalgol>	neeasade: OK, how are you overriding flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate?
Oct 19 03:46:56 <twb>	aidalgol: compared to when you could walk from .se to .su ?
Oct 19 03:47:00 <neeasade>	with setq, in an org-mode hook
Oct 19 03:47:46 <aidalgol>	neeasade: OK, that'll be why.  `with-temp-buffer' doesn't set a mode on the buffer, AIUI.
Oct 19 03:48:17 <aidalgol>	And `flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate' is buffer-local.
Oct 19 03:48:21 <aidalgol>	twb: I... don't know?
Oct 19 03:48:27 <neeasade>	oh, I should have added some more context. I call (org-mode) within my (with-temp-buffer) context
Oct 19 03:48:40 <neeasade>	yes, the docstring on it mentions it's OK to use setq rather than setq-local on it though
Oct 19 03:49:02 <aidalgol>	Yeah, the way you're setting it is fine.
Oct 19 03:49:18 <aidalgol>	Seems that should work, then...
Oct 19 03:49:43 <aidalgol>	Maybe print the value of `flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate' in your `with-temp-buffer' call to see if it's set?
Oct 19 03:49:51 <neeasade>	aidalgol: already did :(
Oct 19 03:49:55 <aidalgol>	And...?
Oct 19 03:49:59 <neeasade>	it was set correctly
Oct 19 03:50:03 <aidalgol>	Hmm...
Oct 19 03:50:20 <aidalgol>	What *exactly* is the thing that's giving an unexpected result?
Oct 19 03:50:22 <neeasade>	I'll link the code in a sec so there's more context. the real problem I'm solving is I want a "flyspell-string" function that uses my predicate override -- so that I can have a spellcheck guard that is org-aware
Oct 19 03:51:09 <aidalgol>	I'll have to go soon, I'm afraid.
Oct 19 03:51:29 <JordiGH>	bremner: This you? https://lobste.rs/s/fr3ght
Oct 19 03:52:06 <neeasade>	ah, well ok, thanks for your time anyway. The thing that's giving an unexpected result is "flyspell-goto-next-error" -- in my org-mode buffer it reports there are no spelling errors. but in the temp buffer context (with the SAME org contents inserted) it jumps to the first fake spelling error
Oct 19 03:52:37 <neeasade>	I say fake because it's skipped by my overridding of the flyspell-generic-check-word-predicate function
Oct 19 03:52:46 <neeasade>	(in "regular" use)
Oct 19 03:54:36 <mrcow>	Hey
Oct 19 03:54:50 <mrcow>	:q
Oct 19 03:54:53 <mrcow>	
Oct 19 03:54:56 <mrcow>	oops
Oct 19 03:55:02 <aidalgol>	Actually, why even use flyspell in a temp buffer?  Why not use the ispell.el functions directly?
Oct 19 03:55:50 <aidalgol>	I suspect you'll run into further problems due to flyspell being written with a visible UI in mind.
Oct 19 03:56:15 <neeasade>	aidalgol: I'm trying to make a flyspell guard where I'm using emacs in a batch context with some org files
Oct 19 03:56:33 <aidalgol>	What do you mean by "flyspell guard?"
Oct 19 03:56:54 <neeasade>	something to stop org-export of a file with a check that says "Hey! there are misspelled things here!"
Oct 19 03:57:21 <neeasade>	but honestly been stuck at this weird  wall for long enough I'm coming to the conclusion it's not worth it -- these are gonna be long-living articles I may as well do the once-over interactively anyway
Oct 19 03:58:27 <neeasade>	the code: 
Oct 19 03:58:28 <neeasade>	org-mode-hook: https://git.io/JT8lB , flyspell-string: https://git.io/JT8lD
Oct 19 04:00:24 <aidalgol>	OK, yeah, looks like ispell would be no easier.
Oct 19 04:03:21 <neeasade>	aidalgol: thanks for helping/talking it out anyway
Oct 19 04:14:18 <Viking667>	hm, I see edrx has disappeared again

Oct 19 10:20:56 <francisv-local>	(I just asked also in #org-mode.)
Oct 19 10:23:24 <roxlu>	hi, i've just installed deft and it will automatically create a .org file with #+TITLE when it can't find a note, but is it also possible to create a new file directly that adds the `#+TITLE` ?

Oct 19 10:30:01 <bremner>	paul424: do you have two files named EditorMode.cpp?
Oct 19 10:30:24 <bremner>	also, I endorse the use of "minibar" to describe emacs components

Oct 19 10:45:17 <rnkn>	where can I learn how to write a proper makefile in plain (i.e. non-GNU) english?
Oct 19 10:46:26 <thblt>	That's a strange question. What's GNU English?
Oct 19 10:46:28 <bremner>	I don't understand. Is this some kind of passive aggressive complaint about the GNU Make docs?
Oct 19 10:46:50 <wasamasa>	there's POSIX specification :D
Oct 19 10:46:51 <thblt>	But search-engining “how to write makefiles” returns an endless stream of good results.
Oct 19 10:47:07 <wasamasa>	as non-GNU as it gets
Oct 19 10:47:12 <bremner>	or do you want to know about non-GNU-Make?
Oct 19 10:47:31 <wasamasa>	it also helps with not accidentally relying on GNU-specific features
Oct 19 10:48:14 <thblt>	I've been wanting to play with Shake for some time now https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake
Oct 19 10:48:36 <thblt>	A build system that requires a full Haskell toolchain to run is a good build system.
Oct 19 10:48:37 <francisv-local>	hmm, I searched more in the documentation, I thought `:file' or `:var' would work for that, but no.
Oct 19 10:48:56 <wasamasa>	https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/08/20/

Oct 19 10:50:27 <rnkn>	wasamasa: thanks
Oct 19 10:51:24 <rnkn>	the GNU make docs are not very well written, no
Oct 19 10:56:32 <break_point>	rnkn: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction
Oct 19 10:59:07 <pjb>	writing makefiles can be done in so many different ways…
Oct 19 10:59:12 <rnkn>	break_point: thanks, although that's the difficult writing to which I was referring
Oct 19 10:59:28 <rnkn>	mine eyes! zee goggles do nothing!
Oct 19 10:59:36 <pjb>	Depending on the size of the project, on whether you want to reuse the makefiles or not for other projects, on other platforms, etc.
Oct 19 11:00:01 <wasamasa>	POSIX is difficult in another way
Oct 19 11:00:21 <pjb>	The best you can do, IMO, is to study how makefiles are used by different projects, from kermit to GNUstep (to cite two extreme but good examples), passing thru very bad applications of makefiles…
Oct 19 11:01:14 <pjb>	That said, I would use just GNU make.  It's free software, all computers nowadays are connected to the Internet, so you can easily download and compile it everywhere.  So there's no reason not to make it a prerequisite of any project.
Oct 19 11:01:24 <pjb>	More info in #workingset…
Oct 19 11:02:00 <bremner>	mac users will complain, but that's a feature :P
Oct 19 11:02:16 <rnkn>	I'm a mac user
Oct 19 11:02:32 <bremner>	and you just complained about GNU Make. I rest my case
Oct 19 11:02:37 <rnkn>	POSIX seems to be doing pretty well so far
Oct 19 11:03:23 <rnkn>	GNUmake is fine, I just find those particular docs seem to be written by someone who has difficulty explaining something they know to someone who doesn't
Oct 19 11:03:44 <rnkn>	the old curse of knowledge problem
Oct 19 11:04:11 <bremner>	I guess there is probably an O'Reilly book

Oct 19 11:33:43 <rnkn>	so I've got emacs to do tabs on macOS, http://ix.io/2BeU/diff
Oct 19 11:34:00 <rnkn>	wondering if anyone knows how to have the tab bar show in fullscreen
Oct 19 11:34:03 <rnkn>	* native tabs
Oct 19 11:38:02 <twb>	aidalgol: have you seen this half life 2 source game: https://youtu.be/-p3zj0YKKYE#t=189
Oct 19 11:39:05 <thblt>	rnkn: emacs has native tabs?
Oct 19 11:40:32 <rnkn>	thblt: macOS native tabs
Oct 19 11:40:45 <rnkn>	they are disabled by default out of spite
Oct 19 11:42:08 <thblt>	rnkn: do they work just like that? 
Oct 19 11:42:17 <twb>	https://youtu.be/-p3zj0YKKYE#t=407  (same video)
Oct 19 11:43:09 <plant_enjoyer>	hi, how do I pass a list as &rest to another function? I tried (values mylist), but it doesn't work as expected
Oct 19 11:43:38 <plant_enjoyer>	searching for this on the net is surprisingly hard, I feel like I'm missing on terminology
Oct 19 11:43:52 <rnkn>	thblt: they work perfectly fine, except in fullscreen you need to move the pointer up to the top of the screen
Oct 19 11:44:28 <thblt>	rnkn: how do they work exactly? Each tab is an emacs frame?
Oct 19 11:44:40 <rnkn>	yeh
Oct 19 11:45:10 <rnkn>	the same as tabs in safari or finder or iwork apps
Oct 19 11:45:25 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: what's the use case?  
Oct 19 11:46:20 <rnkn>	plant_enjoyer: (apply 'FUN LIST)
Oct 19 11:47:09 <thblt>	rnkn: you sure? apply is &rest too
Oct 19 11:47:28 <rnkn>	I think I misunderstood
Oct 19 11:48:16 <thblt>	rnkn: they want to pass a list to a function that takes &rest.
Oct 19 11:48:50 <rnkn>	so there's already ARG1 ARG2 &rest LIST ?
Oct 19 11:50:22 <thblt>	IIUC the question is how to call (message "%s %s %s" 1 2 3), say, from (let ((args '(1 2 3))) (message "%s %s %s" ????)) without explicit destructuring (assuming the list can be any length)
Oct 19 11:50:52 <thblt>	A macro could work, but I'm asking about the use case because there may also be an easier way.
Oct 19 11:51:31 <terpri_>	rnkn, apply is &rest for convenience (so you can supply some fixed intial args without consing them onto the list)
Oct 19 11:51:45 <terpri_>	docstring: "Call FUNCTION with our remaining args, using our last arg as list of args."
Oct 19 11:52:48 <thblt>	Indeed: (let ((args '(1 2 3))) (apply 'message "1=%s 2=%s 3=%s" args))
Oct 19 11:52:51 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: ^
Oct 19 11:53:17 <thblt>	thanks terpri_, who'd have thought about reading the docstring? Certainly not me!
Oct 19 11:53:50 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: I want to call secrets-create-item like (secrets-create-item "session" "irc" password tags) - tags is a list
Oct 19 11:57:46 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: see above, but “tags” is not part of secrets-create-item. Maybe you mean (secrets-create-item "session" "irc" password :tags MYLIST)?
Oct 19 11:58:26 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: in the docs the signature is "secrets-create-item collection item password &rest attributes"
Oct 19 11:58:57 <terpri_>	weirdly, 'values' is just an alias for 'list' in elisp (there's another potential advantage of guile-emacs :) where true multiple values are actually supported)
Oct 19 11:58:59 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: yes, attributes isn't tags. If you have a list of attributes, just (apply…)
Oct 19 11:59:36 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: (apply 'secrets-create-item "session" "irc" password attributes)?
Oct 19 12:00:12 <thblt>	looks good
Oct 19 12:00:48 <nhkays>	anyone know how to setup a separate word list for aspell? i need to put one in that sits outside of the home dir.
Oct 19 12:01:03 <nhkays>	use on*
Oct 19 12:02:06 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: doesn't throw an error now, thanks
Oct 19 12:02:31 <rnkn>	so turned out it was jsut `(apply 'FUN LIST)'?
Oct 19 12:03:02 <thblt>	rnkn: (apply FUN ARG1 ARG2 ARG3 REST-LIST)
Oct 19 12:03:59 <rnkn>	nhkays: M-x customize-group RET ispell
Oct 19 12:04:12 <rnkn>	looks like the top option could be what u want
Oct 19 12:04:35 <thblt>	Eg, this will (error): eg (defun my-test (args) (message "I got: %s" args)) (apply 'my-test '(Hello world))
Oct 19 12:04:54 <thblt>	Correct invocation is (apply 'my-test '(Hello world) nil)
Oct 19 12:06:03 <nhkays>	thanks
Oct 19 12:06:14 <plant_enjoyer>	it still doesn't save the password somehow though.. eh
Oct 19 12:07:32 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: maybe it won't override an existing item?
Oct 19 12:09:49 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: nope, there's no such item there
Oct 19 12:12:36 <thblt>	plant_enjoyer: have you tried with a basic invocation (secrets-create-item "Test collection" "Test item" "qwertyuiop")
Oct 19 12:14:15 <thblt>	I can't test myself, I have nothing listening on this dbus name.
Oct 19 12:16:36 <plant_enjoyer>	thblt: na, I'll give up. thanks for the help though
Oct 19 12:39:25 <tinga>	Hi. I've got a hook on 'inferior-scheme-mode-hook which runs `(paredit-mode 1)`, *then* runs a series of `(define-key inferior-scheme-mode-map ..)` actions; somehow the later don't have any effect if paredit-mode is turned on, otherwise they work fine.
Oct 19 12:39:29 <tinga>	Why is this?
Oct 19 12:40:03 <tinga>	(It seems like using paredit-mode makes inferior-scheme-mode-hook not use inferior-scheme-mode-map. ?)
Oct 19 12:40:50 <thblt>	tinga: (1) define-key in a hook is weird.
Oct 19 12:41:19 <thblt>	wdym don't have any effect? Are the  keys unbound, or stolen by paredit?
Oct 19 12:41:22 <tinga>	(paredit.el recommends using `eval-after-load` but that is only called once after paredit.el is loaded, right? Not each time it's turned on.)
Oct 19 12:41:38 <tinga>	thblt, stolen by paredit
Oct 19 12:41:55 <tinga>	i.e. the same as if I didn't use define-key at all
Oct 19 12:42:31 <thblt>	tinga: yes, but you don't want to bind keys each time it's turned on, you just need to customize the bindings to your liking once.
Oct 19 12:43:22 <tinga>	The problem is paredit shadows some essential key bindings from inferior-scheme-mode-hook; I prefer to have those over the paredit ones in this context.
Oct 19 12:43:39 <thblt>	keymaps precedence issues are tricky. If you never use those paredit bindings, you can just remove them.
Oct 19 12:43:45 <tinga>	Like, M-r to get at history, or C-d
Oct 19 12:44:04 <tinga>	I do use them in scheme-mode (normal text editing).
Oct 19 12:44:36 <tinga>	I'm just confused how key maps work, I thought it was 1 key map active at any one time, looks like that's not what happens.
Oct 19 12:45:24 <thblt>	absolutely not. It's a ton of keymaps active at every single time.
Oct 19 12:47:14 <tinga>	Or said differently, I thought that inferior-scheme-mode-map is the combined key map that is used while in inferior-scheme-mode (maybe put together from various other key maps, but I thought that inferior-scheme-mode-map is the entry point for key mappings when in inferor-scheme-mode)
Oct 19 12:47:46 <tinga>	Emacs is like super low level and high level at the same time it seems.
Oct 19 12:47:58 <thblt>	I *think* the cleanest solution lies somewhere in reordering ,,dv minor-mode-map-alist
Oct 19 12:47:58 <fsbot>	Alist of keymaps to use for minor modes.
Oct 19 12:47:59 <fsbot>	Each element looks like (VARIABLE . KEYMAP); KEYMAP is used to read
Oct 19 12:47:59 <fsbot>	key sequences and look up bindings if VARIABLE’s value is non-nil.
Oct 19 12:47:59 <fsbot>	If two active keymaps bind the same key, the keymap appearing earlier
Oct 19 12:47:59 <fsbot>	in the list takes precedence.
Oct 19 12:48:22 <thblt>	But really you should read about keymaps first.
Oct 19 12:48:24 <pjb>	It's also a property of lisp.  Lisp primitives are actually low-level. But we have macros to implement a higher level language.
Oct 19 12:50:06 <tinga>	(Sure (and I'm a long time lisper), but Emacs as an API I sometimes feel I'm working on a really low level, now I'm surprised that key maps are much higher level than I'm used to. I don't have that much Emacs experience, though.)
Oct 19 12:53:00 <thblt>	Emacs is low level given hardware that doesn't actually exist.
Oct 19 12:53:07 <pjb>	tinga: indeed. The API is often difficult to use.  It's more like an exportation of the internals, than a well designed and easy to use API.
Oct 19 12:53:27 <thblt>	Like Haskell is assembly language in an alternative history of computing :)
Oct 19 12:53:54 <pjb>	I only started learning Haskell, so so far, I only have bad things to say about it… :-/
Oct 19 12:54:07 <pjb>	It's quite not exactly like the revelation you may have when learning lisp.
Oct 19 12:57:31 <thblt>	pjb: It's Haskell that has only bad things to say about YOU.
Oct 19 12:58:02 <thblt>	(I'm joking, of course)
Oct 19 13:00:13 <pjb>	Indeed, so far.
Oct 19 13:00:46 <thblt>	pjb: what book/course are you using?
Oct 19 13:02:47 <tinga>	(I feel that Haskell and Scheme aren't that different, except Haskell replaces the dynamic nature of Lisps with a static one (including using typed AST nodes for Template Haskell over the dynamic s-expr representation of lisps). That's good and bad in some respective ways.)
Oct 19 13:03:24 <tinga>	(As I sometimes say, Haskell feels like the C++ of functional programming.)
Oct 19 13:05:27 <thblt>	I feel that the much stronger constraints on mutation have a deep impact of the language.
Oct 19 13:05:41 <thblt>	You can't hack your way around with a (set) and a shameful comment.
Oct 19 13:06:17 <tinga>	True, I should have qualified my statement with "aren't that different if you use functional separation in Scheme, too"
Oct 19 13:06:32 <thblt>	But I've been playing with Haskell, on and off, for… some time, and it hasn't fully clicked yet.  By contrast, it took me… hours, say, to start feeling confident with Rust.
Oct 19 13:07:08 <tinga>	(Also note that in Haskell you can hack your way via mutation too by using the state monad locally.)
Oct 19 13:07:38 <thblt>	tinga: of course, but it's already way harder than a (set)
Oct 19 13:07:46 <tinga>	I'm finding Rust more difficult to tame than Haskell.
Oct 19 13:07:51 <thblt>	tinga: you need to know the state monad, for a start :)
Oct 19 13:08:01 <bpalmer>	emacs keymaps are inferior to xemacs keymaps.  opaque structures > lists in terms of presenting an API
Oct 19 13:08:27 <bpalmer>	not really related to what you were discovering with keymap precedence, though.
Oct 19 13:08:46 <tinga>	thblt, sure but that's part of dynamic <-> static, so I cover it with the "except" :)
Oct 19 13:08:58 <thblt>	tinga: it's a matter of taste, I think. Rust looks a lot like C as I like it, with the things I miss in C added :)
Oct 19 13:09:34 <tinga>	I find Rust boring compared to Haskell except when it comes to life times... then I want to go back to Haskell :)
Oct 19 13:10:06 <thblt>	The iterator infrastructure is so so cool I was blown away the first time I implicitely converted a list of option  into an option list

Oct 19 16:16:25 <wgreenhouse>	grym: huh, a "flight" is the mass noun for political ads?
Oct 19 16:16:46 <wgreenhouse>	like a flight of bombers, similar effect on those so "targeted" I guess
Oct 19 16:17:10 <bandali>	lol
Oct 19 16:20:38 <jlf>	grym: possible explanation - https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/1318172539722629121
Oct 19 16:26:43 <grym>	jlf: yeah.  i'm, uh, not counting any chickens.  But voting at fenway park was very pleasant this weekend!
Oct 19 16:27:39 <wgreenhouse>	grym: after all, chickens have a habit of running across the road, and/or getting eaten by foxes.
Oct 19 16:28:05 <grym>	wgreenhouse: something like that
Oct 19 16:28:12 <wgreenhouse>	moving to a rural place made me realize that "why did the chicken cross the road?" is an actually salient question
Oct 19 16:28:30 <wgreenhouse>	they do, all the time, especially in whichever direction will cause the keeper the most embarrassment
Oct 19 16:28:33 <grym>	"because they're kiiiind of idiots"
Oct 19 16:28:45 <grym>	there are smart birds.  chickens aren't it 
Oct 19 16:28:50 <wgreenhouse>	our neighbor's chickens always slip out to go lay in the cemetery
Oct 19 16:29:05 <wgreenhouse>	which is pretty hilarious...for us
Oct 19 16:29:16 <bremner>	spooky chicken seems like it should be a band
Oct 19 16:29:25 <bremner>	rudybot: make it so
Oct 19 16:29:33 <rudybot>	bremner: I'm going to make a mistake which will make it useless, so avoid any problems which require it
Oct 19 16:30:43 <cvandusen>	rudybot: Don't play the pronoun game 
Oct 19 16:30:44 <rudybot>	cvandusen: The complexity of verb conjugation has got little to do with whether the language is pro-drop or not. And I know I can't answer your question without a pronoun. However, I can write in my journal "Swam yesterday." as a lede without needing the "I". It's not ungrammatical, it's not even informal, it's written in many places, and software manuals are an entirely appropriate place to write that as well.

Oct 19 16:33:18 <mplsCorwin>	"This has been a test of the emergency weather provisioning system"
Oct 19 16:33:22 <wasamasa>	mplsCorwin: I've asked Jean Louis elsewhere whether he is even interested in technical feedback for his latest inflammatory email
Oct 19 16:33:30 <wasamasa>	mplsCorwin: because it otherwise feels like a waste of time
Oct 19 16:34:21 <mplsCorwin>	wasamasa: that was the subject that got me ego surfing them.  I've no indication this person is interested in technical points from anything I've been able to find in the intertubes.  More interested in the politics AFAICT
Oct 19 16:34:49 <wasamasa>	maybe not a complete waste of time since other people will see they're being contrary for no good reason
Oct 19 16:35:06 <wasamasa>	but still, why go into the weeds if they're going to ignore it anyway
Oct 19 16:35:53 <wasamasa>	why help them if they're going to turn that against you
Oct 19 16:37:13 <wgreenhouse>	mplsCorwin, wasamasa: what is this person's deal on the mailinglist?
Oct 19 16:37:25 <mplsCorwin>	I'm finding the whole thing very gauling.  It's making it hard to keep up with the mailing list as I have to take a break and come here and rant, nap, install some spyware from Amazon, something, each time I run across one of these.
Oct 19 16:37:26 <wasamasa>	for example, say that I point out savannah is laughible in terms of overall security, but also mention I did review that codebase, found issues and talked to people in charge
Oct 19 16:37:55 <wasamasa>	their take-away will be to ignore my first claim and turn the second one into "Now even Savannah is as secure as Github!!!"
Oct 19 16:38:04 <wgreenhouse>	lel
Oct 19 16:38:12 <wasamasa>	I'd almost say it's like feeding a troll
Oct 19 16:38:16 <mplsCorwin>	wgreenhouse: All ideology, all repitition, no awareness of the tactical situation, no concern with technology (if that's even relivant to free software, no sure)
Oct 19 16:38:21 <wasamasa>	that's how it feels to me
Oct 19 16:38:33 <mplsCorwin>	^ I validate u
Oct 19 16:41:17 <Demosthenex>	so, i'm struggling with an issue. i need a single person nagios, maybe to check that routine jobs complete, emails received ,etc. i'm at a loss where to put this, though i'm considering adding it into my org-agenda somehow
Oct 19 16:41:33 <oats>	why is it possible to have a function and a variable with the same name???
Oct 19 16:41:34 <fsbot>	Of course not!
Oct 19 16:41:54 <mplsCorwin>	oats: scope keeps symbol tables minty fresh
Oct 19 16:42:14 <oats>	huh?

Oct 19 16:42:33 <oats>	I feel like I should do a proper elisp tutorial one of these days instead of muddling through, trying to figure out things myself
Oct 19 16:42:46 <wasamasa>	wgreenhouse: I could do a detailed breakdown on this one or just wait it out until they disappear under a bridge
Oct 19 16:43:08 <mplsCorwin>	An excellent collection of elisp learning and reference materials just hit RReddit the other day.. lemme dig.
Oct 19 16:43:41 <grym>	wasamasa: "ask me about magit-forge!"
Oct 19 16:44:05 <mplsCorwin>	oats: elisp ref collection post on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jdcqc9/awesome_elisp_a_list_of_resources_about_emacs_lisp/
Oct 19 16:44:14 <oats>	oh cool, thanks
Oct 19 16:44:25 <oats>	but what are symbol tables and why are they so minty fresh :P
Oct 19 16:44:46 <oats>	is that just like a hash map of symbols to elisp objects?
Oct 19 16:45:21 <mplsCorwin>	oats: something that elisp doesn't have lol.   Why our elisp always has morning breath.  (And why we need to have seperate slots for function and var, I guess, since we don't have different tables for different packages or anything.)
Oct 19 16:46:12 <oats>	huh, so they have separate "namespaces"?
Oct 19 16:46:31 <mplsCorwin>	oats: in other languages each "namespace" has its own symbol table E.g. NS1:.foo would different symbol than NS2.foo, both called foo but stored in a different table.
Oct 19 16:46:35 <mplsCorwin>	yes, exactly.
Oct 19 16:47:00 <oats>	that doesn't feel super lispy tbh :P
Oct 19 16:47:04 <technomancy>	that's why it's called lisp-2; because of 2 main namespaces. (in reality elisp has closer to ... five?)
Oct 19 16:47:09 <mplsCorwin>	func vs var is as close as we get to namespace right now and even then they are sharing symbol props

Oct 20 11:35:35 <pjb>	perrier-jouet: perhaps you have something in ~/.emacs that makes it full screen?
Oct 20 11:35:47 <pjb>	perrier-jouet: or perhaps it's a window manager problem.
Oct 20 11:36:09 <perrier-jouet>	it was perfect before

Oct 20 12:28:19 <dokma>	Is there any way to force this function to do case insensitive search?
Oct 20 12:28:20 <dokma>	        https://github.com/coldnew/eshell-autojump/blob/c6a8b81a16576df9875e721fbbfe6690d04e7e43/eshell-autojump.el#L108
Oct 20 12:28:20 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/LFsKkmXqAo
Oct 20 12:29:02 <dokma>	It's taking case-fold-search from eshell-under-windows-p. I am not under Windows but still want to have case insensitive matching for auto-jump.
Oct 20 12:29:14 <bpalmer>	dokma: without redefining it, one way would to temporarily rebind eshell-under-windows-p
Oct 20 12:29:50 <bpalmer>	(flet ((eshell-under-windows-p () t)) (eshell/j))   , using the original flet
Oct 20 12:30:26 <bpalmer>	I think you'd have to use letf rather than cl-flet ; but I always forget how cl-flet changes things from flet.
Oct 20 12:30:53 <bpalmer>	(you can use flet with (require 'cl) ; cl-flet comes from cl-lib)
Oct 20 12:31:13 <dokma>	I want to have it permanently in eshell. BTW is there a better way to fuzzy jump folders in eshell?
Oct 20 12:31:17 <bpalmer>	dokma: or, if you're willing to affect the rest of eshell's functions, you could absolutely redefine it
Oct 20 12:31:24 <bpalmer>	(defun eshell-under-windows-p () t)
Oct 20 12:31:56 <dokma>	I tried redefining eshell/j but it's not working for some reason.
Oct 20 12:33:28 <dokma>	bpalmer: tried this: https://pastebin.com/pxtnC5LY
Oct 20 12:33:42 <wasamasa>	_maddy: hum, so it's indeed that
Oct 20 12:33:50 <wasamasa>	_maddy: why only for tls in emacs though
Oct 20 12:34:04 <dokma>	bpalmer: are you related to Robert Palmer author of Simply Irresistible?
Oct 20 12:34:24 <bpalmer>	dokma: case-fold-search should be t , not nil, if you want searching to be case insensitive.
Oct 20 12:34:57 <bpalmer>	if you look for clues, you might find some; I won't tell you any sweet lies
Oct 20 12:36:31 <dokma>	bpalmer: now works! I was too hasty.

Oct 20 12:41:13 <bpalmer>	Let's write a survey in bash.
Oct 20 12:50:41 <b_100205>	wasamasa pls forgive my late response, they are not related, i just thought that it would be nice to read my newspaper in the gnus feature, and a local newspaper im subscribed to, offers epubs to its subscribers vial mail or you can log on to their website to read, and i just thought it would be nice to read their stuff in gnus as well... but maybe a way to have rss is good enough. I didn't mean to criticise anything, i just thought it
Oct 20 12:50:42 <b_100205>	would be great to be able to read the full news there without having to go to my emails or to go to their website in their browser but being able to use gnus. sorry if i came off us a dick.
Oct 20 12:57:11 <thblt>	b_100205: if you receive them by mail it's by far the easiest way.
Oct 20 12:58:52 <_maddy>	wasamasa: I think the problem is affecting other things also, i.e. I am having delays to connecting to other services, and small things like that, but for some reason emacs just doesn't work at all
Oct 20 13:00:03 <b_100205>	thblt: yes i just get my gnu email system set up and use it that way with the epub feature
Oct 20 13:00:06 <wasamasa>	_maddy: yeah, I'd expect some other programs to break, like rubygems
Oct 20 13:01:44 <_maddy>	should I just disable ipv6 permanently for everything? like is that actually needed for anything? alternatively I will just disable it when I need to update emacs packages, which is a good enough workaround
Oct 20 13:08:48 <thblt>	Well you won't be able to connect to machines that aren't reachable on ipv4
Oct 20 13:19:44 <piyo>	August 5, 2219 3rd Fleet Earth Orbit
Oct 20 13:41:20 <wgreenhouse>	_maddy: as the years go on, increasingly many services and websites will be ipv6-only, as the world's supply of ipv4 addresses is used up
Oct 20 13:41:58 <wgreenhouse>	so unless you have a reason other than this bug to disable ipv6, you should try to figure out the root cause 
Oct 20 13:47:19 <_maddy>	yeah but I think it's hard to figure out.. I will just disable it whenever I need to update packages
Oct 20 13:47:39 <_maddy>	really I do that like maybe every 2 months or so
Oct 20 13:53:14 <oats>	Anybody using circe know why, even if I have (setq circe-use-cycle-completion t), cycle completion isn't being used?
Oct 20 13:53:54 <oats>	completion-cycle-threshold is also t
Oct 20 13:55:20 <bremner>	oats: it seems to work here
Oct 20 13:55:32 <oats>	hrmmm
Oct 20 14:04:38 <_maddy>	can anyone give me any tips where would I look about fixing this indentation for my major mode? https://paste.rs/QhZ.lisp
Oct 20 14:04:48 <bkhl>	Anyone know if it's possible to make projectile-find-file only care about files tracked in Git for the current project? It's not working out so sell in my home directory with Git tracked dot-files.
Oct 20 14:05:27 <_maddy>	I am using lisp-indent-line for my indent-line-function, ideally I could somehow modify that, instead of writing everything from scratch
Oct 20 14:07:26 <wgreenhouse>	_maddy: if you're lucky, it could be tied to a specific kernel version and you might be able to upgrade or downgrade your way out of it
Oct 20 14:08:18 <pjb>	_maddy: you should not want that indentation! :-)
Oct 20 14:09:16 <_maddy>	pjb: why not? I hate when indentation suddenly goes so far to the right, it's really ugly
Oct 20 14:09:18 <pjb>	_maddy: but otherwise, you have two variables holding indent functions: indent-line-function and indent-region-function.
Oct 20 14:09:27 <pjb>	that's because of your parentheses!
Oct 20 14:09:34 <pjb>	Use defun if you want less indentation.
Oct 20 14:09:58 <pjb>	so you should look at the functions stored in those variables, and see their documentation and how they can be customized.
Oct 20 14:10:11 <_maddy>	I don't have defun, this is my own custom lisp language :)
Oct 20 14:10:12 <pjb>	_maddy: alternatively, you can write your own indenting function and store it in those varibles.
Oct 20 14:12:18 <pjb>	_maddy: the standard lisp-indent-region calls lisp-indent-line (directly, not thru the variable).
Oct 20 14:14:10 <pjb>	_maddy: if you use those functions eventually lisp-indent-function is called, and it uses properties set to the operator symbol to compute the indentation.
Oct 20 14:14:42 <pjb>	_maddy: so you could configure a lisp-indent-function property on fn, to ensure a negative indentation.
Oct 20 14:14:53 <OlCe>	_maddy: Hi. You could use 'indent' declarations for your macros.
Oct 20 14:15:30 <_maddy>	here is something simple I tried https://paste.rs/BRB with the idea of just increasing the indentation by 2 from previous line, but I get error: indent-line-to: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil
Oct 20 14:15:44 <pjb>	_maddy:  you would have to put your own function here! Because the other options implemented by lisp-indent-function always indent positively.
Oct 20 14:15:44 <OlCe>	_maddy: You can lookup '(elisp)Declare Form'.
Oct 20 14:17:04 <OlCe>	_maddy: As you'll see, you can have your own function called by 'lisp-indent-function' for your macros only.
Oct 20 14:19:46 <_maddy>	OlCe: where would I look that up?
Oct 20 14:20:19 <pjb>	in lisp-mode.el
Oct 20 14:20:26 <pjb>	_maddy: type C-h f lisp-indent-function RET
Oct 20 14:20:32 <pjb>	then: C-x o TAB RET
Oct 20 14:21:55 <OlCe>	_maddy: In Emacs Lisp's manual.
Oct 20 14:22:38 <OlCe>	_maddy: E.g., in Emacs, type M-: and then exactly (info "(elisp)Declare Form")
Oct 20 14:23:23 <OlCe>	_maddy: (there is a single space between Declare and Form, no newlines; beware of filling here)
Oct 20 14:24:11 <pjb>	Your lisp indent function will have to use the state to find what is the indentation of the (fn sexp, and compute the offset back to the column 2.
Oct 20 14:26:09 <_maddy>	OlCe: yes, found it, but isn't this about modifying emacs lisp indenting? I have a custom lisp language I am trying to make a major mode for
Oct 20 14:27:17 <OlCe>	_maddy: Indeed. I thought you were doing some tuned Emacs Lisp.
Oct 20 14:27:52 <OlCe>	_maddy: But then you can still put the indent directive in the 'lisp-indent-function' property

Oct 20 15:02:16 <_maddy>	well I managed a minimalistic indent function, it just takes indent from previous line and adds 2 to it :) not usable for anything, but a good start I guess
Oct 20 15:05:01 <mplsCorwin>	bremner: it *does* access the windows registry but, afaik, only to find the location of a few things that we be in the ENV if Windows was a real os: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/MS_002dWindows-Registry.html
Oct 20 15:05:07 <_maddy>	creating a minimal major mode seems somewhat manageable for a newbie, the keymap, syntax table and font-lock keywords were fairly easy to do by looking at examples
Oct 20 15:05:57 <thblt>	of course a real real os could design its ENV as a structured hierarchy of typed data, a bit like the Windows registry.

Oct 20 15:10:13 <fsbot>	Everything is broken and nobody is happy.
Oct 20 15:10:48 <rpav>	both true, but if i had to choose, env is less of a hassle to deal with heh
Oct 20 15:11:04 <wgreenhouse>	it is until it causes mysterious problems
Oct 20 15:11:13 <rpav>	not really
Oct 20 15:11:34 <rpav>	"causes mysterious problems" is the registry's default condition
Oct 20 15:11:55 <rpav>	so at worst, you're about as bad, but you also know how it works and it's reasonably transparent
Oct 20 15:12:24 <wgreenhouse>	providing application settings based on process inheritance (which the parent process can change on its own for its children) is a lot more mysterious than a registry you can search and edit from one place, IMO
Oct 20 15:12:53 <bremner>	s/edit/corrupt/
Oct 20 15:13:00 <wgreenhouse>	it's fun when you LD_PRELOAD something and then one of the children decides to ,,tableflip,, and unset LD_PRELOAD
Oct 20 15:13:01 <fsbot>	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Oct 20 15:13:11 <mplsCorwin>	┏━┓┏━┓┏━┓ ︵ /(^.^/)
Oct 20 15:13:15 <bremner>	rudybot: no, YOUR A SPOF!
Oct 20 15:13:18 <wgreenhouse>	also fun that people need hacks like ,,exec-path-from-shell
Oct 20 15:13:19 <rudybot>	bremner: Then there was the guy who had an office of about ten fbsd workstations.  The last guy was running server daemons (like apache and nfs) on the workstations, on DIFFERENT workstations, to "avoid SPOF"
Oct 20 15:13:19 <fsbot>	exec-path-from-shell is [0] a hack to set `exec-path' shellishly for Emacsen not launched from a shell, https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell
Oct 20 15:13:20 <fsbot>	[1] or you could just stop launching Emacs from the dock
Oct 20 15:13:29 <rpav>	that's not really how env is used though .. i mean comparing the two is kinda apples and oranges in practical terms anyway
Oct 20 15:14:00 <rpav>	compare ~/.config or dotfiles or something to the registry
Oct 20 15:15:01 <rpav>	in windows you have like, "regular" settings in the app folder or the user folder, "mysterious" settings in AppData/whocantell, and "really wtf settings" in the registry, but then you also have the environment 
Oct 20 15:15:16 <wgreenhouse>	true. a BSDer would want the same options to be in dotfiles as are offered as command line options as are offered as environment variables
Oct 20 15:15:24 <wgreenhouse>	but in practice few *nix apps are really like that
Oct 20 15:15:46 <rnkn>	exec-path-from-shell makes sense in macOS context if you don't think of Aqua as analogous to an X session
Oct 20 15:16:04 <wgreenhouse>	rnkn: it makes sense if you do think of it as analogous to an X session :)
Oct 20 15:16:15 <wgreenhouse>	it solves exactly the same problem as can arise with linux gui login managers
Oct 20 15:16:18 <rpav>	the reality is everything ends up working well enough to get today's job done so unless some specific thing doesn't (and you find something to replace it), it doesn't really matter
Oct 20 15:16:26 <wgreenhouse>	rnkn: those aren't login shells typically
Oct 20 15:17:03 <rnkn>	yeh what I mean is that an X session is launched from the *nix console, and so inherits the environment
Oct 20 15:17:19 <mplsCorwin>	rudybot: later tell Viking669 Freenode ops confirmed we should go ahead and patch to chat.freenode.net:  <deadk> if you query irc.freenode.net you'll get the answers for chat.freenode.net and a cname record <deadk> if you query chat.freenode.net you'll just get the answers for chat.freenode.net
Oct 20 15:17:19 <rudybot>	mplsCorwin: I asked `MemoServ' to forward the message to Viking669.
Oct 20 15:17:22 <wgreenhouse>	rnkn: exactly. or not. depending :)
Oct 20 15:17:27 <rnkn>	whereas aqua doesn't
Oct 20 15:17:44 <wgreenhouse>	an xdm/gdm/slim/whatever started as a service by the init system isn't a login shell
Oct 20 15:17:53 <wgreenhouse>	and this is a source of confusion here approximately as often as the macos case
Oct 20 15:17:54 <rnkn>	so apps launched from aqua ought not to inherit the shell env, whereas apps launched within an X session would
Oct 20 15:18:34 <rpav>	rnkn: no .. X sessions don't have a shell to inherit *from*
Oct 20 15:18:44 <rnkn>	yeah they do
Oct 20 15:18:45 <wgreenhouse>	maybe you explicitly spelled out an environment for your X session manager's children, but likely not
Oct 20 15:18:54 <wgreenhouse>	rnkn: it depends how they're invoked
Oct 20 15:19:03 <wgreenhouse>	"startx" yes, gui login manager no
Oct 20 15:19:06 <rpav>	^
Oct 20 15:19:26 <rpav>	this is slightly confusing in that we're using "X session" to mean something it really isn't
Oct 20 15:19:48 <rnkn>	right, but that gui login manager is just doing the same steps you'd do if booting into the console and running startx, right?
Oct 20 15:19:56 <wgreenhouse>	rnkn: nope! :)
Oct 20 15:20:09 <rpav>	"the thing that runs ~/.xsession" is a login manager, which isn't launched from and doesn't inherit from a shell; if you typed `startx` you'll get whatever that has of course
Oct 20 15:20:10 <wgreenhouse>	for one thing, it typically bypasses invoking a login shell, and so does not source ~/.profile etc.

Oct 31 23:56:41 <renzhi>	Hi, is there a way to force background color regardless of theme?
Oct 31 23:57:27 <renzhi>	I tried set-background-color, but putting it in init.el file does not seem to have any effect.
Oct 31 23:58:07 <jamzattack>	renzhi: you need to use set-background-color after loading the theme that you want
Oct 31 23:58:41 <renzhi>	I did that, but it does not take effect
Oct 31 23:59:57 <jamzattack>	try it manually first to see if it works (it does for me): M-x load-theme blah M-x set-background-color blah
Nov 01 00:00:00 <renzhi>	In my init file, I do (load-theme 'xxx) then (set-background-color "black") but that does not do
Nov 01 00:00:12 <renzhi>	manually it works
Nov 01 00:02:05 <jamzattack>	I suspect when you use load-theme in your init file it's actually waiting until the frame's created before loading...  could try using advice

Nov 06 21:58:18 <johnjay>	how can you have a compatible core among lisps when there are differences like lisp-1/2 etc?
Nov 06 21:58:38 <wasamasa>	clever tricks
Nov 06 21:58:44 <pjb>	johnjay: Have a look at (intersection common-lisp emacs-lisp scheme) http://www.informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/intersection-r5rs-common-lisp-emacs-lisp/
Nov 06 21:58:45 <rudybot>	https://teensy.info/X56wi8kOXh
Nov 06 21:59:01 <technomancy>	cross-lisp compatibility is like ... trying to make a bilingual pun
Nov 06 21:59:02 <johnjay>	also this is the first time I heard of EULisp
Nov 06 21:59:08 <johnjay>	the logo is the lisp lambda in the EU stars
Nov 06 21:59:55 <aidalgol>	technomancy: I have joined the ranks of HiDPI monitors, and it is glorious.
Nov 06 22:00:54 <aidalgol>	technomancy: Also, re puns: https://somecleverreference.tumblr.com/post/115622641451
Nov 06 22:04:21 <technomancy>	hidpi monitors are ageist
Nov 06 22:04:32 <technomancy>	against people who have bad eyesight
Nov 06 22:05:03 <technomancy>	lol purgatorio
Nov 06 22:05:07 <epony>	I like 100 ppi ones, not found any economic reason to move to higher non-even pixel density yet.
Nov 06 22:05:37 <epony>	the web is still 720p at 50 Mbps
Nov 06 22:06:12 <epony>	and google is 10 Mbps for mobiles
Nov 06 22:17:38 <johnjay>	i'm a bit mystified by the emacswiki page on icicles
Nov 06 22:17:50 <johnjay>	it lists 7 or 8 different ways to obtain all the files
Nov 06 22:18:01 <johnjay>	... have you heard of tar? Gzip?
Nov 06 22:18:41 <wgreenhouse>	johnjay: drew adams believes in emacswiki as the primary way of distributing his elisp
Nov 06 22:18:56 <wgreenhouse>	don't try to change him, you'll only get frustrated
Nov 06 22:19:08 <johnjay>	sure. but usually when you want to distribute things you try to make it easy for people to get the thing
Nov 06 22:19:10 <johnjay>	lol
Nov 06 22:19:34 <wgreenhouse>	some people are seemingly at best indifferent to that consideration :D
Nov 06 22:20:21 <johnjay>	well people can be odd i suppose. I read somewhere someone had to explain to RMS exactly why a user pressing ESC 3 times was trying to break out of the running task or something
Nov 06 22:29:21 <jfb4_>	why didn't RMS know 
Nov 06 22:31:43 <cvandusen>	ignorance?? 
Nov 06 22:31:44 <fsbot>	Don't count on it
Nov 06 22:42:41 <technomancy>	project idea: a signal client for computers, but it actually works
Nov 06 22:43:53 <fiete>	technomancy: are there supported interfaces a free app could use? When I read about that a while ago it sounded like the owners of signal do not want third party apps.
Nov 06 22:44:07 <technomancy>	fiete: I think that is accurate.
Nov 06 22:44:13 <fiete>	:-(
Nov 06 22:44:30 <fiete>	But on my end the signal app does work ok-ish
Nov 06 22:44:38 <technomancy>	they don't trust anyone else to do it right, so no one is allowed to interoperate, which means all we have is their awful client
Nov 06 22:44:55 <technomancy>	after leaving it open for over a week it just shows a blue screen
Nov 06 22:45:03 <fiete>	Is it electron? feels like that
Nov 06 22:45:04 <technomancy>	usually restarting it fixes it, but now today it's stopped fixing it
Nov 06 22:45:18 <technomancy>	it's extremely electron; garbage.
Nov 06 22:45:31 <mplsCorwin>	If the Emacs community can't make room for someone who wants their source maintained on (locked pages) of a Wiki it's hard to say where that person should look for camaraderie.  I don't think it's risky to use his work; until MELPA caved to pressure to remove them Drew's stuff was easy to install.
Nov 06 22:45:35 <dale>	Yeah, it works pretty good for me on macOS so far.  The iOS app, OTOH, shit itself and needed to be reinstalled this week.
Nov 06 22:46:05 <technomancy>	ah! now it's working. needed three restarts, not just one. good job electron.
Nov 06 22:46:32 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: you have no idea how hard it is for me to resist the urge to vandalize his elisp
Nov 06 22:46:52 <mplsCorwin>	have you tried?
Nov 06 22:46:54 <fiete>	technomancy: I'm also confused about that huge loadingtimes
Nov 06 22:47:03 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: I don't have the guts for it
Nov 06 22:47:12 <technomancy>	but I really want someone to do it
Nov 06 22:47:36 <mplsCorwin>	technomancy: afaik one first needs an MediaWiki exploit to bypass the locked page feature.
Nov 06 22:47:38 <dale>	"Let's make a secure messaging app!" "Great idea!" "And let's put a full web browser and JS engine without a sandbox in it!" "Ye—wait what"
Nov 06 22:47:58 <fiete>	dale: :-D
Nov 06 22:48:01 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: ah ok; that was not the case when I looked at it initially (years ago)
Nov 06 22:48:10 <dale>	(I actually think there is some kind of sandbox?  So I was at least 50% going for laughs.)
Nov 06 22:48:39 <dale>	mplsCorwin: I thought it was MoinMoin or something like that, is it really MediaWiki?
Nov 06 22:48:50 *	mplsCorwin double checks
Nov 06 22:48:53 <technomancy>	dale: there is a sandbox because when you first launch it, it's like "hey, I'm not going to launch because you didn't chmod the sandbox in /opt to 4755 so you need to go do that manually you peasant"
Nov 06 22:49:03 <technomancy>	which like ... what the ever-loving fuck?
Nov 06 22:49:28 <technomancy>	it's not mediawiki or moinmoin
Nov 06 22:49:30 <dale>	technomancy: Uh WTF.  I don't get that on macOS.
Nov 06 22:49:31 <technomancy>	it's a custom perl wiki
Nov 06 22:49:35 <Viking667>	Is there a quick one-liner for splitting a frame into four?
Nov 06 22:49:36 <fiete>	technomancy: hmm what distribution? Using the debian package on my debian and did not have that issue
Nov 06 22:49:44 <technomancy>	fiete: debian here
Nov 06 22:49:50 <fiete>	same here
Nov 06 22:50:03 <fiete>	hmm why haven't i experienced that
Nov 06 22:50:22 <technomancy>	I think it depends on chromium somehow and my chromium is pretty old
Nov 06 22:50:23 <Viking667>	I can do it in three steps normally; C-x 3, C-x 2, C-x o C-x 2
Nov 06 22:50:34 <fiete>	ahh ok, that may be possible
Nov 06 22:50:56 <dale>	Hm, just realized how unfunny "bro give me your phone number so I can send you some cat memes that definitely do not exploit bugs in the underlying image libraries" sounds.
Nov 06 22:51:04 <mplsCorwin>	dale: "This wiki uses the oddmuse wiki engine" so not MediaWiki, anyway.
Nov 06 22:51:16 <dale>	mplsCorwin: Oddmuse!  Right.  I  was thinking "muse-something".
Nov 06 22:51:28 <technomancy>	oddmuse was created by the emacswiki maintainer IIRC
Nov 06 22:52:17 <mplsCorwin>	this is pretty cool, in fact.  (Not that I know much about the guts of a wiki)
Nov 06 22:57:01 <mplsCorwin>	Without going really deep, and assuming EW followed the docs, I suspect finding the exploit for locked pages will take at least *some* work.  My guess is one would go after an authorized user in preference to trying to bruteforce EW itself.  It's a wiki so click-jacking seems like low hanging fruit.
Nov 06 22:57:50 <technomancy>	less work to find an exploit in "some guy's random perl wiki" vs mediawiki tho =)
Nov 06 22:58:10 <mplsCorwin>	Maybe.
Nov 06 22:58:42 <technomancy>	altho mediawiki is PHP so who knows
Nov 06 22:58:48 <mplsCorwin>	:)
Nov 06 22:58:59 <dale>	Now compare difficulty of exploiting Oddmuse to difficulty of exploiting Drew's machine.
Nov 06 22:59:18 <markasoftware>	When i autocomplete with lsp-mode and Clangd, the autocompletion includes the arguments to the function
Nov 06 22:59:43 <technomancy>	wait so the whole point of a wiki is that it's editable
Nov 06 22:59:53 <markasoftware>	eg, when I try to autocomplete free_ctx, it does not expand into `free_ctx(cursor_here)`, but rather `free_ctx(struct my_struct blah)cursor_here`
Nov 06 22:59:58 <technomancy>	isn't a locked wiki like ... an inherent contradiction?
Nov 06 23:00:01 <markasoftware>	how can I make it only autocomplete the function name
Nov 06 23:00:01 <mplsCorwin>	dale: exactly what I'm thinking.  But Drew probably isn't special in that case, except that we know of a wiki we might "catch" him editing.
Nov 06 23:00:53 <dale>	markasoftware: I don't use lsp-mode but my recollection is that there is a variable matching the regexp lsp-.*snippet.* that needs to be changed.
Nov 06 23:01:01 <mplsCorwin>	technomancy: I had a friend who maintained wikis for a living. That always confounded me.
Nov 06 23:01:18 <dale>	markasoftware: I *think* "snippet" is the word in the setting you're looking for, assuming they haven't changed it since I last looked.
Nov 06 23:01:39 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: like they maintained the wiki software, or they kept the pages up-to-date and spam-free?
Nov 06 23:01:53 <markasoftware>	hmm i see some snippet variables related to lua and kotlin but not c
Nov 06 23:02:01 <mplsCorwin>	technomancy: The latter.
Nov 06 23:02:21 <dale>	markasoftware: Well that's disappointing.  I wouldn't have even thought it would be language-specific.
Nov 06 23:02:35 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: well, that makes sense to me; wikis naturally degrade over time if they don't have people keeping things updated and consistent.
Nov 06 23:02:38 <markasoftware>	there's an lsp-enable-snippet but i think it's for autocompleting snippets, eg yasnippet? idk
Nov 06 23:02:50 <dale>	markasoftware: Try turning that off and see what happens maybe?
Nov 06 23:03:44 <mplsCorwin>	technomancy: I mean... just have a website and be done with it?  Why pay someone to correct the content?  But I guess the ease of GitHub PRs wasn't a thing then.  (This friend died about 7yrs back)
Nov 06 23:04:19 <markasoftware>	huh i turned that variable on and off and now it works as i expect?
Nov 06 23:04:32 <markasoftware>	well thanks Dale, I'll continue looking into these variables
Nov 06 23:04:37 <mplsCorwin>	technomancy: in fact she said it was a vanity thing; her clients wanted to be able to say their content could be edited by anyone but really they wanted things just so.
Nov 06 23:04:56 <dale>	markasoftware: NP, happy to have maybe helped.
Nov 06 23:04:58 <technomancy>	mplsCorwin: ahh, yeah I mean depending on the subject matter it could be weird
Nov 06 23:05:21 <technomancy>	Let's apply for a job opening as the Memory Alpha wiki maintainer.
Nov 06 23:06:28 <dale>	technomancy: Is your résumé your name and email address followed by five pages of choice memes?
Nov 06 23:07:08 <technomancy>	https://p.hagelb.org/spock-yes.gif
Nov 06 23:07:21 <dale>	Perfect.
Nov 06 23:07:21 <mplsCorwin>	lol
Nov 06 23:15:44 <johnjay>	dale: i don't know what circle of hell javascript is from but we're stuck with it
Nov 06 23:26:59 <markasoftware>	dale: Apparently I have to remove the company-tng frontend
Nov 06 23:27:15 <markasoftware>	which is weird because i don't remember ever adding it, and it wasn't in my init file...maybe customized at some point
Nov 07 00:51:53 <Viking667>	Is there a quick one-liner for splitting an emacs frame into four?  I can do it in three (well, four) steps normally; C-x 3, C-x 2, C-x o C-x 2

Nov 07 00:55:55 <jamzattack>	Viking667: well really, that splits the window into four..  you'd need to put (delete-other-windows) in there to make the name correct I guess
Nov 07 00:57:51 <pottag>	how do I download a webpage through eww?
Nov 07 00:58:16 <jamzattack>	pottag: `eww-download' (d in eww-mode-map)
Nov 07 00:58:26 <pottag>	Thanks!
Nov 07 00:59:19 <Viking667>	jamzattack: that does exactly what I want, though getting it into one line is a bit adventurous. Thanks for that.

Nov 07 01:03:23 <parsnip>	frdg: i thought the modes use like "function-face" or whatever it's called, and themes just modify that.
Nov 07 01:03:33 <dale>	frdg: What is "global highlighting"?
Nov 07 01:03:38 <Viking667>	parsnip: I've tried three of thim, E thenk
Nov 07 01:03:47 <Viking667>	err, three of them, I think
Nov 07 01:04:14 <dale>	Viking667: I have to ask what your keyboard layout is that you just swapped E and I for the second half of that sentence? :)
Nov 07 01:04:36 <Viking667>	dale: sorry, wasn't quite consedratung... dvorak
Nov 07 01:05:18 <frdg>	by global highlighting I mean when I do `customize face` It has me customize `font-lock-function-name-face` but when I customize this it changes the colors for all my programming languages. If I go to `customize` though I can see that each language has its own variable but when I change them nothing happens.
Nov 07 01:05:32 <Viking667>	cf;k a; ,dpp G ,a;lqk gl x,dokte  <<< hm. Trying to type dvorak in qwerty keyboard layout really messes things up.
Nov 07 01:06:08 <Viking667>	A neat (if confusing) way to vaguely obfuscate things.
Nov 07 01:06:30 <jamzattack>	translated: just as well I wasn't in qwerty.
Nov 07 01:06:39 <dale>	frdg: Can you give me an example of a language-specific variable that you're changing to no effect?  Preferably one that is built-in to Emacs, if possible.
Nov 07 01:06:51 <Viking667>	jamzattack: ha. How'd you manage to crowbar that one out that quickly?
Nov 07 01:06:52 <dale>	Viking667: That's funny.
Nov 07 01:07:07 <dokma>	The local variables list in ***** contains values that may not be safe --- even after ! exclam marking it permanently safe?
Nov 07 01:07:18 <dokma>	Comes up on every restart.
Nov 07 01:07:33 <dokma>	Where is that 'permanently safe' state stored?
Nov 07 01:07:34 <parsnip>	is that something that goes to custom-file?
Nov 07 01:07:41 <parsnip>	what is value of custom-file?
Nov 07 01:07:44 <jamzattack>	Viking667: qwerty keycaps...  took at least a second per character though
Nov 07 01:07:54 <dale>	parsnip: I believe it is.
Nov 07 01:07:56 <Viking667>	ah. Right.
Nov 07 01:08:13 <dale>	parsnip: I think it gets stored in safe-local-variable-values.
Nov 07 01:08:30 <parsnip>	they could probably add that setting to their "deliberate" config
Nov 07 01:08:48 <parsnip>	i actually have custom-file set to "/tmp/custom.el"
Nov 07 01:08:53 <frdg>	sure `prolog builtin face` and `flora-font-lock-arrow-face`. On the other hand the haskell faces work as expected.
Nov 07 01:09:10 <parsnip>	because i got tired of package.el complaining about not being able to write to /dev/null or something.
Nov 07 01:09:21 <Viking667>	Cy-o mrp. ugb ircbi yd. ryd.p ,af <<-- qwerty keycaps in dvorak.
Nov 07 01:09:44 <jamzattack>	Viking667: yeah that's twice as hard to figure out lol
Nov 07 01:09:57 <parsnip>	ehind-bay im-hay
Nov 07 01:10:09 <parsnip>	anyone?
Nov 07 01:10:10 <fsbot>	Just ask your question. It's the best way to know if anyone can help. https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html
Nov 07 01:10:11 <Viking667>	oot adb
Nov 07 01:10:39 <Viking667>	"behind him"
Nov 07 01:10:53 <parsnip>	yeah but what movie
Nov 07 01:11:05 <Viking667>	Oh good grief. I don't know!
Nov 07 01:11:10 <Viking667>	I don't really watch movies.
Nov 07 01:11:20 <parsnip>	hint: johnny five alive!
Nov 07 01:12:10 <parsnip>	they're on the sidewalk and one of the thugs tells the other thugs to go behind johnny-five and hit him... johnny-five doesn't know pig latin
Nov 07 01:12:23 <SpiderPig>	Just updated to 27. I thought I would have to rework my config with early-init.el for it to work but it still works the same.
Nov 07 01:12:29 <dale>	frdg: I'm reading prolog.el.  Turns out that it uses font-lock-builtin-face if that face is defined, or prolog-builtin-face otherwise.
Nov 07 01:12:33 <Viking667>	definitely not The Day the Earth Stood Still
Nov 07 01:13:18 <frdg>	dale: so if I undefine these font-lcok faces things should work?
Nov 07 01:13:23 <dale>	frdg: So prolog.el defines the face and then promptly doesn't use it, at least not on any remotely recent Emacs I think.  (Maybe XEmacs is still different or something.)  Solution there may be to just (setq prolog-builtin-face 'prolog-builtin-face) to get prolog-mode to use prolog-builtin-face.
Nov 07 01:13:36 <jamzattack>	dale, frdg: fwiw prolog-builtin-face is obsolete in 28
Nov 07 01:13:41 <dale>	frdg: (See variable—not face—prolog-builtin-face.)
Nov 07 01:14:22 <jamzattack>	"prolog-builtin-face is an alias for the face ‘font-lock-builtin-face’.  This face is obsolete since 28.1; use ‘font-lock-builtin-face’ instead."
Nov 07 01:14:30 <dale>	jamzattack: Aaaand thank you for alerting me to the face that I'm running a built from emacs-27 instead of master, apparently.
Nov 07 01:14:49 <Viking667>	hang on, 28.1? 
Nov 07 01:14:58 <dale>	frdg: I emphatically do NOT recommend undefining font-lock-builtin-face, ever.
Nov 07 01:15:25 <dale>	Viking667: master just says that in preparation for the day in the (not near AFAIK) future when 28 will be released.
Nov 07 01:15:48 <Viking667>	I compiled yesterday from master, I get GNU Emacs 28.0.50 (build 1...) from that
Nov 07 01:15:51 <frdg>	ok this is problematic because I am using another language that I guess also uses `font-lock-builtin-face` though the emacs mode for it was built off of the prolog-mode from what I understand.
Nov 07 01:16:31 <parsnip>	can't modes be modified, to some extent
Nov 07 01:16:55 <frdg>	yes I will work through it  now that I understand the problem.
Nov 07 01:17:03 <dale>	frdg: So https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/2968 suggests you can set a buffer-local value for the *variable* font-lock-builtin-face to point to another face.
Nov 07 01:17:14 <parsnip>	like, if modes are mostly indentation and syntax highlighting, they are also pretty easy to modify there, i expect.
Nov 07 01:17:37 <dale>	frdg: I have never tried this, but perhaps if you customize prolog-builtin-face and then (setq-local font-lock-builtin-face 'prolog-builtin-face) in a function you place in prolog-mode-hook, this might work.
Nov 07 01:17:53 <frdg>	ok I will try this
Nov 07 01:17:58 <dale>	frdg: (As jamzattack said, prolog-builtin-face will apparently go away at some point in the future, but you can at least see if it works for you for now and worry about the future in the future.)
Nov 07 01:18:09 <frdg>	ok
Nov 07 01:18:26 <SpiderPig>	Is splitting up a config into early-init.el necesary or is it simply a performance boost?
Nov 07 01:18:48 <parsnip>	why not just make font-lock-function-face buffer local?
Nov 07 01:19:18 <dale>	parsnip: You can modify font-lock-defaults or font-lock-keywords or whatever in a mode hook, I expect, but font-lock-keywords often has a very complex value, IMHO, and gets hard to modify.  Maybe there are better ways.
Nov 07 01:19:34 <holomorph>	SpiderPig: it was a compromise/workaround for dealing with how packages are loaded
Nov 07 01:20:31 <dale>	parsnip: I think that's what I suggested.  Though note that you can't make a *face* buffer local, AFAIK.  I *think* faces are stored either in symbol properties or else somewhere in some C construct, they're not just in a symbol's value slot AFAIK.
Nov 07 01:21:03 <parsnip>	dale: hmm, seems to be done here: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FacesPerBuffer
Nov 07 01:21:06 <SpiderPig>	holomorph: yea, it looks like it would be aplicable to my config. I have it setup to  bootstrap use-package via package. But it works the same as in 26
Nov 07 01:21:15 <parsnip>	oh wait
Nov 07 01:21:29 <parsnip>	dale: i didn't read that whole link, maybe it is saying the solution for emacs 23+
Nov 07 01:21:57 <parsnip>	M-x buffer-face-set
Nov 07 01:22:25 <SpiderPig>	holomorph: I guess I thought it would be aplicable because somewhere I read it is called before package-initialize which is called before init.el
Nov 07 01:22:43 <dale>	parsnip: From reading this it sounds to me like that will change the face for just one buffer rather than for all buffers in a given major mode, but you could be right.
Nov 07 01:23:10 <dale>	parsnip: Seems like the hint about face remapping there could also be used.
Nov 07 01:23:13 <parsnip>	sure so a mode-hook should work, no?
Nov 07 01:23:27 <dale>	parsnip: Yeah, it should.
Nov 07 01:23:32 <frdg>	parsnip: `M-x buffer-face-set` is perfect. Ill just set a hook and the problem is solved. Thanks guys
Nov 07 01:23:46 <dale>	parsnip: It's not clear to me why that's better than the "Prior to Emacs 23" solution, but it should work.  Maybe face remapping is considered better somehow.
Nov 07 01:23:58 <Viking667>	hm. that brings to mind... one of the first lines in my .emacs is package-initialize, just after (require 'package). Are the two related?
Nov 07 01:24:43 <parsnip>	dale: magic
Nov 07 01:25:06 <parsnip>	i don't peak behind the curtain
Nov 07 01:26:01 <parsnip>	Viking667: i'm guessing require is redundant to initialize
Nov 07 01:26:36 <Viking667>	hm. 
Nov 07 01:26:48 <Viking667>	Time to edit my .org then.
Nov 07 01:27:18 <jamzattack>	Viking667: require, and package-initialize are both redundant.  firstly because all the necessary package functions are autoloaded, secondly because package-enable-at-startup is set to t by default
Nov 07 01:27:47 <parsnip>	Viking667: i think some redundancy is fine
Nov 07 01:31:16 <Viking667>	lol. I wasn't aware of that.
Nov 07 01:31:55 <Viking667>	Okay. Now I have to figure out (remember, actually) how to wrap a region in #+BEGIN_SRC ... #+END_SRC tags.
Nov 07 01:32:04 <Viking667>	I seem to remember a keybind to that somewhere.
Nov 07 01:32:14 <parsnip>	(require 'org-tempo) to get the old bindings
Nov 07 01:32:21 <parsnip>	< s TAB
Nov 07 01:35:15 <jamzattack>	Viking667: C-c C-, runs the command org-insert-structure-template
Nov 07 01:36:45 <parsnip>	ah, that's the new binding
Nov 07 01:36:58 <Viking667>	don't need it, I found C-c C-v d
Nov 07 01:37:03 <jfb4_>	Viking667: in emacs 27 you don't need package-initialize
Nov 07 01:37:12 <Viking667>	and in 28?
Nov 07 01:37:27 <parsnip>	i think they meant 27+
Nov 07 01:37:59 <Viking667>	jamzattack: would C-c C-, have worked for a region?
Nov 07 01:38:14 <parsnip>	,tias
Nov 07 01:38:15 <fsbot>	Try it and see! (then tell us what you saw)
Nov 07 01:38:18 <Viking667>	lol.
Nov 07 01:39:23 <Viking667>	figures... the answer is most certainly yes (Copyright (C) 2020 fsbot)
Nov 07 01:40:03 <Viking667>	but org-babel-demarcate-block asked me what language, then tagged it as I wanted
Nov 07 01:44:09 <dale>	parsnip: I think you've converted me to the church of (invert-face 'default).
Nov 07 01:44:21 <parsnip>	yes!
Nov 07 01:44:33 <dale>	I fixed which-func's face and it's fine in the status bar now.
Nov 07 01:44:43 <Viking667>	ugh. That'll teach me. tried marking something as c when it was meant to be emacs-lisp. Just as well I didn't write that out.
Nov 07 01:44:53 <parsnip>	nice. is that a clear upstream issue?
Nov 07 01:45:34 <dale>	parsnip: Not really, I don't think.  The defaults are probably fine in the default mode line colors, since it appears in the mode line by default.

Nov 07 20:46:51 <fsbot>	␕
Nov 07 20:56:53 <apteryx>	hello! Is there an option I'm missing with counsel-git-grep to make it defaults to search the word at point?
Nov 07 20:57:06 <apteryx>	currently I have to type or copy/paste it every time, which gets tiring quickly (especially being used to Helm, which would do that for me).
Nov 07 20:58:28 <thblt>	apteryx: (interactive) doesn't populate initial-input.  You could write your own wrapper
Nov 07 21:00:04 <apteryx>	OK
Nov 07 21:00:14 <apteryx>	seems a common thing to want
Nov 07 21:01:09 <thblt>	I have no idea to be honest, but if you think so you can just patch the function and contribute your patch!
Nov 07 21:01:34 <thblt>	Wait
Nov 07 21:01:45 <thblt>	There'd ivy-initial-inputs-alist
Nov 07 21:01:51 <thblt>	There's
Nov 07 21:04:13 <thblt>	Demo: (add-to-list 'ivy-initial-inputs-alist (cons 'counsel-git-grep (lambda nil "Hello!")))
Nov 07 21:05:30 <apteryx>	oh! that's neat!
Nov 07 21:05:34 <apteryx>	Thanks for the find
Nov 07 21:11:16 <thblt>	That Four Seasons Landscaping story is the weird cherry on the top of a very weird election.
Nov 07 21:29:58 <breadw>	thblt: wait what?
Nov 07 21:32:53 <thblt>	breadw: the Trump team is doing right now (if I'm not timezone-confused) a press conference at a small Philadelphia landscaper's offices, Four Seasons Landscaping.
Nov 07 21:33:15 <thblt>	Which is an… interesting choice of location. Best guess is they wanted a conf room at the Four Seasons hotel, made a mistake and went with it.
Nov 07 21:33:46 <thblt>	https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/1325152158866567168
Nov 07 21:34:38 <breadw>	oh lol THAT is rich
Nov 07 21:34:54 <acdw>	you're right, it's a cherry on top of a completely inept administration
Nov 07 21:35:06 <acdw>	like, of COURSe they'd do that
Nov 07 21:35:08 <acdw>	..
Nov 07 21:35:08 <acdw>	anyway, EMACS
Nov 07 21:35:08 <acdw>	emacs is great
Nov 07 21:37:37 <thblt>	Except for lanscaping, one could say.
Nov 07 21:37:49 <thblt>	landscaping.
Nov 07 21:39:01 <acdw>	HAHAHAAHAH
Nov 07 21:39:07 <acdw>	and text editing, quoth the haters
Nov 07 21:46:39 <Viking667>	I've got emacs --daemon running, but I can't figure out how to restore tabs I had saved last night
Nov 07 21:47:54 <Viking667>	i.e. I had a tab with four windows and I don't know how to pull up a list of defined tabs. 
Nov 07 21:49:09 <thblt>	Viking667: tabs are a frame parameter. I guess they die with the frame.
Nov 07 21:49:25 <Viking667>	ewww.
Nov 07 21:49:42 <thblt>	You could persist them I guess.
Nov 07 21:49:57 <Viking667>	And that's the bit I don't know (yet) how to do.
Nov 07 21:50:22 <Viking667>	Info docs are great, but sometimes I need questions asked that they don't have immediately to hand.
Nov 07 21:50:51 <Viking667>	Ah well. At least the buffers still exist. 
Nov 07 21:50:55 <thblt>	Hook on frame destruction and save (frame-parameter FRAME 'tabs) to some variable.
Nov 07 21:51:08 <thblt>	tabs aren't buffer, they're a window configuration iiuc.
Nov 07 21:51:41 <Viking667>	I might have to start naming my frames then
Nov 07 21:52:15 <Viking667>	lol. Am I into emacs-juju territory yet?
Nov 07 21:52:54 <Viking667>	Makes me wonder how many people run emacs in --daemon mode vs how many just run straight emacs
Nov 07 21:53:28 <thblt>	I guess most users use the daemon.
Nov 07 21:55:00 <Viking667>	huh. I only discovered the daemon about umm... three months ago.
Nov 07 22:51:18 <grym>	dale: i don't have any openAPI client generation knowledge, but i kind of want to.
Nov 07 22:58:21 <grym>	thblt: best yet, said landscaping office is between a crematorium and a sex toy shop, so they can actually FOAD >:)
Nov 07 23:41:21 <dale>	grym: OK, thanks anyway.
Nov 07 23:48:29 <grym>	dale: or, if our customers tell us what they're using ... 
Nov 07 23:48:44 <grym>	dale: i want something that can ingest a jsonschema and emit attrs classes, though i know of no such thing 
Nov 07 23:49:48 <dale>	grym: I've been working with an API that has a JSON schema but it turns out its OpenAPI definition is lacking.  They just punt for "object" for some of the more complex types, so I didn't know it when I asked you that question, but in this case an OpenAPI client wouldn't have helped me.
Nov 07 23:50:39 <dale>	grym: I've been trying to use Desert to generate Marshmallow schemas from dataclasses, but I'm now backpedaling on that idea.  I think instead I want to go the other way around and generate dataclasses from Marshmallow schemas.
Nov 07 23:51:07 <dale>	grym: Oh, I just realized, this API doesn't have a JSON schema either, so never mind that possibility.  I like your idea too, though.
Nov 08 00:33:30 <dale>	apteryx: Re-reading your thing about counsel-git-grep, have you tried hitting M-n after invoking it?
Nov 08 00:34:00 <dale>	apteryx: That should insert the symbol at point as input, complete with \_< \_> around it.
Nov 08 00:35:14 <dale>	apteryx: And this works for most/all Ivy prompts, I think.  (Some will not include \_< \_> and actually I bet counsel-git-grep might be one of those, since I think maybe counsel.el doesn't know how to translate those into regexp specials that git-grep understands.  I see this also with counsel-rg, for example.)
Nov 08 00:48:35 <thblt>	that's a smart binding reuse.
Nov 08 01:58:44 <grym>	dale: right, i know how to go from desert to jsonschema; i don't know how to do the reverse (but would love to)
Nov 08 02:00:27 <dale>	grym: I'm honestly surprised that someone hasn't already done it.  I just googled and nothing obvious came up.
Nov 08 02:04:05 <grym>	dale: codegen sucks 
Nov 08 02:04:13 <grym>	(in python anyway)
Nov 08 02:11:00 <Viking667>	I'm having some real fun with tab-line-mode, I'm not sure how to rearrange the buffers in a window without manually deleting tabs and recreating them in order.
Nov 08 02:11:42 <Viking667>	i.e. I have a preference for alphabetic sorting, but I don't get that.
Nov 08 02:23:47 <laertus>	is there a way to do a "git mv foo bar" from magit?
Nov 08 02:33:29 <parsnip>	laertus: renaming via dired then staging the commits is similar but not sufficient?
Nov 08 02:33:43 <parsnip>	*staging the changes
Nov 08 02:34:08 <laertus>	yeah, when i do a "git mv foo bar" it'll be a single renaming change in git, rather than a deletion and addition of a file
Nov 08 02:34:57 <laertus>	i think it makes more sense when it's shown as a rename rather than the deletion of a file and the addtion of a file, which, for all the reader knows might be two unrelated files
Nov 08 02:34:59 <dale>	laertus: Git doesn't store renames AFAIK, so move via dired then stage delete and add "new" file should be equivalent AFAIK.
Nov 08 02:35:10 <laertus>	hmm
Nov 08 02:35:24 <Viking667>	I have here (from google) magit-rename-file (bound to R in the magit window): https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/23917/how-to-move-rename-a-file-within-magit
Nov 08 02:35:28 <laertus>	well, when i do a "git mv" outside magit, magit shows it as a rename
Nov 08 02:35:35 <laertus>	but not so if i delete and add a file
Nov 08 02:35:41 <Viking667>	that's correct.
Nov 08 02:35:43 <parsnip>	but if you stage the, then yes, no?
Nov 08 02:35:45 <parsnip>	*them
Nov 08 02:36:11 <dale>	laertus: That sounds... weird.  What does "git status" show?
Nov 08 02:36:11 <laertus>	Viking667: i think that maybe what i'm looking for.. thanks!
Nov 08 02:36:47 <Viking667>	I just used this in momma google: emacs rename file with magit
Nov 08 02:37:19 <laertus>	papa #emacs is better :)
Nov 08 02:37:50 <Viking667>	but not necesssarily faster. However, nobody'll snaffle your nick for advertising in #emacs
Nov 08 02:38:28 <laertus>	it's often faster
Nov 08 02:38:52 <Viking667>	I must admit though, I looked through the magit info manual first, didn't find what I wanted from the table of contents.

Nov 08 07:15:35 <Viking667>	egads that took a while.
Nov 08 07:15:57 <Viking667>	And now emacs is spinning its wheels like crazy
Nov 08 07:17:07 <Viking667>	Ahh, it was eww slowing things up
Nov 08 07:23:54 <achilles>	is there any way to prevent emacs to create ~/.emacs.d? (w/o hacking the emacs source code)
Nov 08 07:25:33 <jamzattack>	achilles: (setq user-emacs-directory null-device) maybe?  or if `null-device' doesn't work, just move it somewhere out of the way (/tmp/ probably)
Nov 08 07:26:22 <achilles>	i did, it doesn't work. even this variables doc says pointless to set this value.
Nov 08 07:27:06 <achilles>	apropos-value ~/.emacs.d/ returns no result which means there is no variable to change. no, yes?
Nov 08 07:28:53 <achilles>	i can rm it inside .emacs once emacs starts but it'd be an ugly hack.
Nov 08 07:29:01 <Qudit314159>	achilles: There could be something that accesses it on startup before you change it (e.g. a package you've installed)
Nov 08 07:29:36 <achilles>	Qudit314159: no, i put setf u-e-d to the first line.
Nov 08 07:30:04 <jamzattack>	achilles: er, it isn't pointless -- there's a comment saying "The value does not matter since Emacs sets this at startup." but that's referring to its initial value.  emacs -Q --eval '(setq user-emacs-directory "/tmp/snth")' works fine for me
Nov 08 07:31:10 <achilles>	jamzattack: did you remove ~/.emacs.d before try that eval?
Nov 08 07:32:00 <achilles>	because moving it to another location works, but preventing the creation doesn't.
Nov 08 07:32:48 <Viking667>	You could make .emacs.d a file, and make it unremovable, but you'd need to chattr the file, and that takes root access. i.e. sudo
Nov 08 07:32:52 <Qudit314159>	achilles: But if you're using package.el, packages are automatically loaded at startup
Nov 08 07:33:09 <Qudit314159>	You may have better luck with early-init.el
Nov 08 07:33:49 <Qudit314159>	See https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Package-Installation.html#Package-Installation
Nov 08 07:33:54 <achilles>	jamzattack: i tried now, it creates the dir anyway.
Nov 08 07:35:06 <Qudit314159>	achilles: Try setting emacs-user-directory in early-init.el
Nov 08 07:35:17 <jamzattack>	achilles: weird, doesn't for me but I'm on 28
Nov 08 07:35:35 <achilles>	Qudit314159: even without init, with -Q it creates that directory.
Nov 08 07:35:38 <achilles>	jamzattack: me too.
Nov 08 07:35:38 <Qudit314159>	huh
Nov 08 07:36:16 <achilles>	jamzattack: very weird actually, how's this possible?
Nov 08 07:37:03 <Qudit314159>	I would not have thought it was but I always keep my emacs.d
Nov 08 07:37:18 <Qudit314159>	It has a lot of stuff in it :-)
Nov 08 07:38:40 <achilles>	yeah but i have another structure which requires no .emacs.d
Nov 08 07:39:40 <Qudit314159>	Huh, what is that?  You have me a bit curious
Nov 08 07:41:35 <achilles>	oh, nothing special, just different taste of directory naming
Nov 08 07:42:25 <Qudit314159>	The .xyz directories do make a bit of a mess in $HOME
Nov 08 07:44:14 <achilles>	yes and .emacs and .emacs.d not completion friendly in shell.
Nov 08 07:59:14 <johnjay>	ok i'm trying to get emacs to read early-init.el
Nov 08 07:59:18 <johnjay>	but failing
Nov 08 07:59:38 <johnjay>	shouldn't it show up on strace? i defined early-init.el in ~/.emacs.d and have it do (setq abcd 7)

Jan 26 21:14:52 <ornxka>	that is a base-10 representation of a single byte, right?
Jan 26 21:15:04 <grym>	that's a new one on me.. 
Jan 26 21:15:09 <ornxka>	so the actual character is literally 0x7B
Jan 26 21:15:21 <dale>	ornxka: Guessing octal
Jan 26 21:15:48 <dale>	Hm, but that's just S so I don't know why you'd see that escaped.
Jan 26 21:16:19 <ornxka>	oh, the actual number is 223
Jan 26 21:16:29 <ornxka>	sorry i should probably not have extrapolated
Jan 26 21:16:36 <ornxka>	this is from a sjis string
Jan 26 21:16:43 <dale>	OK, so 0x93, that makes more sense.
Jan 26 21:16:49 <dale>	See also https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Non_002dASCII-in-Strings.html
Jan 26 21:16:51 <aidalgol>	Wow, a CVE in 'sudo'
Jan 26 21:17:10 <grym>	aidalgol: "in which we're all reminded that it's like, just another program too"
Jan 26 21:17:21 <aidalgol>	CVE-2021-3156
Jan 26 21:17:22 <dale>	I just got an email about that one from Red Hat.
Jan 26 21:17:39 <aidalgol>	grym: Sobering, isn't it?
Jan 26 21:17:40 <ornxka>	ah there is no x
Jan 26 21:17:43 <ornxka>	so it must be octal
Jan 26 21:18:49 <dale>	I'm pretty sure this is far from the first sudo vuln, right?
Jan 26 21:19:04 <dale>	At a glance I see yet another memory corruption bug.
Jan 26 21:19:22 <aidalgol>	I mean it's a sobering reminder.
Jan 26 21:19:56 <dale>	HN joking about "Rust rewrite in 3, 2, 1..." and I get it, but also maybe not the most horrible idea.
Jan 26 21:20:49 <wasamasa>	maybe not have a super complicated privilege escalation program
Jan 26 21:21:09 <wasamasa>	I like the idea of doas, but it not even being able to remember the password on anything else than openbsd is terribly
Jan 26 21:21:12 <wasamasa>	inconvenient
Jan 26 21:21:52 <JordiGH>	oh no I got boosted by Eugen
Jan 26 21:21:55 <tromey>	what kind of CVE
Jan 26 21:22:09 <ldlework>	Anyone know of a thing that will let you change what kind of quoted string you're inside?
Jan 26 21:22:57 <dale>	ldlework: Maybe https://github.com/cute-jumper/embrace.el is what you had in mind?
Jan 26 21:24:09 <polezaivsani>	tromey, iirc quite a nasty one - priv esc for anybody with access to sudo
Jan 26 21:24:21 <tromey>	ouch
Jan 26 21:24:57 <nullx002>	hi all
Jan 26 21:25:26 <dale>	wasamasa: If a replacement like doas gets more widely adopted, how long until you think it reaches feature parity with sudo?
Jan 26 21:25:43 <wasamasa>	it's a slow process, so slow people only notice after years
Jan 26 21:25:49 <dale>	:)
Jan 26 21:26:04 <wasamasa>	it shouldn't even be that hard to fix that issue with doas
Jan 26 21:26:15 <nullx002>	running ecl on termux and slime is working well with Emacs, can I get quicklisp setup on android?
Jan 26 21:26:28 <wasamasa>	from what I understand it's using an openbsd-exclusive ioctl
Jan 26 21:26:47 <wasamasa>	I've tried it on freebsd and quickly switched back to sudo :D
Jan 26 21:27:02 <wasamasa>	however
Jan 26 21:27:03 <dale>	wasamasa: Does doas bless your session or something with this special API?  AFAIK sudo just creates a ticket file somewhere.
Jan 26 21:27:16 <wgreenhouse>	nullx002: quicklisp claims support for ecl, so should be fine
Jan 26 21:27:20 <wasamasa>	consider that to exploit this someone would need to execute code on your machine
Jan 26 21:27:27 <dale>	Let's just put all our passwords in gpg-agent, surely it's fine.
Jan 26 21:27:30 <wasamasa>	and if they can do that, there's easier ways of waiting for a valid sudo session
Jan 26 21:27:52 <wasamasa>	no need to do heap feng-shui
Jan 26 21:28:06 <wasamasa>	just a stupid shell script that has been already written for you
Jan 26 21:29:41 <nullx002>	yes, but setup is via quicklisp.lisp or manual, I wonder, as it doesn't say ARM support on quicklisp web.. only nix
Jan 26 21:30:04 <wgreenhouse>	nullx002: um, if you install from source, why would it matter ARM or not
Jan 26 21:31:18 <ldlework>	dale: that's pretty handy, thanks
Jan 26 21:31:49 <wasamasa>	dale: look for AUTH in https://man.openbsd.org/tty.4
Jan 26 21:32:40 <dale>	ldlework: If you're doing Python, I have a thing to toggle triple-quoted strings: https://github.com/dsedivec/dot-emacs-d/blob/master/recipes/python-toggle-triple-quotes.el
Jan 26 21:33:31 <dale>	wasamasa: So it's on the TTY, interesting.
Jan 26 21:33:36 <wasamasa>	yup
Jan 26 21:34:47 <grym>	dale: dang
Jan 26 21:36:57 <dale>	grym: ?
Jan 26 21:37:14 <grym>	dale: embrace
Jan 26 21:38:18 <dale>	grym: I feel like the implementation may not be the best, if I try to change the wrong surrounding thing (like single quote instead of double quote), I think it searches way way ahead and ends up fucking me up in surprising ways, but I can just undo and try again.
Jan 26 21:38:33 <dale>	grym: I'm trying really hard not to rewrite it.
Jan 26 21:39:21 <dale>	bremner: Did you bother setting up local TLS for DavMail?
Jan 26 21:40:04 <bremner>	dale: I did, but then I realized that my client didn't like self signed certs, so I gave pu
Jan 26 21:40:09 <bremner>	also gave up
Jan 26 21:40:54 <dale>	I know I probably should not care that my O365 creds are being sent over localhost in the clear, particularly since I assume DavMail is holding an OAuth token somewhere on disk anyway, but it's kind of bugging me in the back of my head.
Jan 26 21:41:53 <ldlework>	oh no, embrace doesn't understand `
Jan 26 21:42:21 <bremner>	dale: maybe your imap fetcher (apple mail?) will tolerate self-signed certs?
Jan 26 21:42:33 <dale>	bremner: Yes, I can make it tolerate self-signed certs, I feel confident in that.
Jan 26 21:42:33 <ldlework>	oh you can add new ones
Jan 26 21:43:06 <bremner>	setting up letsencrypt for this was too much for me
Jan 26 21:44:19 <dale>	bremner: Wow, yeah, I'm with you on that.  Is your DavMail server running on something that doubles as a web server, letting you use ACME HTTPS to get an LE cert?
Jan 26 21:47:27 <bremner>	dale: not really. No public IP on most workstations
Jan 26 21:47:28 <ldlework>	oh god I think I forgot elisp
Jan 26 21:47:38 <ldlework>	i cannot even think about how to do basic things
Jan 26 21:47:48 <bremner>	cons, car, cdr
Jan 26 21:47:52 <ldlework>	lol
Jan 26 21:47:52 <bremner>	yw
Jan 26 21:49:43 <beep1560>	Question: I've executed the following (setq ibuffer-display-summary nil) in order to make the "Name" column don't be truncated. However, truncation still occurs. Am I doing something wrong?
Jan 26 21:50:19 <cvandusen>	That's not the right variable for that.
Jan 26 21:51:54 <beep1560>	Do you know which variable might help me accomplish that?
Jan 26 21:51:56 <cvandusen>	ibuffer-formats
Jan 26 21:52:17 <ldlework>	emacs regex builder: you can checkout, but you can never leave
Jan 26 21:52:23 <cvandusen>	also, define-ibuffer-column
Jan 26 21:53:17 <ldlework>	how do you get out of regex builder lol
Jan 26 21:54:13 <cvandusen>	C-c C-q 
Jan 26 21:54:53 <cvandusen>	or, M-x kill-emacs. your choice 
Jan 26 21:56:31 <Wafficus>	is the following correct on how to set "C-c c" to Org-Capture?
Jan 26 21:56:32 <Wafficus>	   (setq org-capture-templates-contexts
Jan 26 21:56:33 <Wafficus>	   :bind ("C-c c" . org-capture))
Jan 26 21:58:00 <cvandusen>	(setq ...) should be its own expression.
Jan 26 21:58:47 <Wafficus>	cvandusen I'm trying to follow along with Prot's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCdScs4YO8k
Jan 26 21:58:48 <beep1560>	cvandusen: Thanks for the information! Apparently, I can't give unlimited width to column names (only fixed width). Do you know how to accomplish that?
Jan 26 21:58:52 <ldlework>	how do I pass the character " to a function?
Jan 26 21:58:57 <Wafficus>	7:22 cvandusen
Jan 26 21:58:57 <ldlework>	I tried ?" but that didn't work
Jan 26 21:59:05 <dale>	?\" should work
Jan 26 21:59:13 <ldlework>	thanks
Jan 26 21:59:48 <DanC>	I'm trying to set tab-width to 4 in a certain directory (and descendant dirs). I made a .dir.locals.el file , but how do I get it to take effect?
Jan 26 21:59:58 <dale>	beep1560: ISTR buffer name length limits was a major reason I switched to using bs.
Jan 26 22:00:07 <dale>	DanC: .dir-locals.el?
Jan 26 22:00:50 <dale>	DanC: I have never heard of .dir.locals.el, so I am doubting that it will be recognized.  Once you have a correct .dir-locals.el file in place, M-x revert-buffer should do the trick (don't forget to save first, if applicable).
Jan 26 22:01:21 <dale>	DanC: You will have to do that in each buffer you want to see the directory-local variables.
Jan 26 22:01:24 <DanC>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html documents  .dir-locals.el
Jan 26 22:01:48 <dale>	DanC: Yes, good, you said .dir.locals.el not .dir-locals.el, wanted to make sure you had the file named correctly.
Jan 26 22:01:55 <beep1560>	Is there any variable which stores the name of all buffers? I want to obtain the buffer with the longest name.
Jan 26 22:02:16 <DanC>	aha! good catch, dale
Jan 26 22:02:18 <dale>	beep1560: I think you need to cycle through (buffer-list)
Jan 26 22:02:34 <beep1560>	Thanks! :D
Jan 26 22:02:42 <dale>	DanC: Also note that M-x add-dir-local-variable is an easy way to add a new variable to a .dir-locals.el, considering the format can be a bit tough to get right.
Jan 26 22:02:53 <DanC>	whee! thanks!
Jan 26 22:03:12 <dale>	beep1560: Something like (max (mapcar #'length (mapcar #'buffer-name (buffer-list)))) I imagine.
Jan 26 22:03:16 <cvandusen>	Wafficus: You're only seeing part of the use-package invocation. Best to check the whole thing at https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:4e8347de-415e-4804-b383-d61499e05ca1
Jan 26 22:05:51 <Wafficus>	cvandusen would it be better to use "(global-set-key "C-c c" 'org-capture)"?
Jan 26 22:06:25 <DanC>	now... how to manage this .dir-locals.el file... I shouldn't check it into this repo (code is not mine), but I kinda want it to show up whenever I work on this project.
Jan 26 22:06:43 <DanC>	maybe a symlink
Jan 26 22:07:29 <cvandusen>	Wafficus: If your using use-package, :bind ("C-c c" . org-capture) is at least consistent.
Jan 26 22:08:14 <Wafficus>	so I could just do: #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :bind ("C-c c" . org-capture) #+END_SRC
Jan 26 22:08:20 <Wafficus>	in my config? cvandusen
Jan 26 22:08:25 <cvandusen>	Not outside of use-package
Jan 26 22:08:34 <MrFantastik>	https://github.com/typester/emacs/blob/master/etc/sex.6
Jan 26 22:08:42 <MrFantastik>	tf was this lol
Jan 26 22:09:00 <cvandusen>	Wafficus: Are you using use-package to configure packages?
Jan 26 22:09:01 <ldlework>	What would be the best snippet to ensure there are 2 lines after the last import of a file
Jan 26 22:09:17 <lamdacore>	hi. I am trying to figure out batch processes on emails. Something like: fwd all messages with a certain tag to an address. Any hints on how I can go about this? I am using notmuch
Jan 26 22:10:04 <Wafficus>	cvandusen yeah but I don't have a line for use-package for org-capture though :/
Jan 26 22:10:14 <Wafficus>	cvandusen yes I use use-package for other things
Jan 26 22:10:59 <Wafficus>	ah I see, he has this wrapped in "(use-package org-mode"
Jan 26 22:11:05 <cvandusen>	Wafficus: then something like (use-package org-mode :bind ("C-c c" . org-capture)) 
Jan 26 22:11:07 <cvandusen>	yeah
Jan 26 22:11:40 <MrFantastik>	https://github.com/typester/emacs/blob/master/etc/spook.lines
Jan 26 22:12:35 <beep1560>	dale: The following works (max 10 2 3) => 10  while the following doesn't (max '(10 2 3)).
Jan 26 22:12:54 <beep1560>	How can i retrieve all the elements from a list?
Jan 26 22:13:00 <bremner>	apply
Jan 26 22:13:11 <dale>	Oh, huh, my bad.
Jan 26 22:13:15 <dale>	Too used to Python.
Jan 26 22:15:08 <brandflake11>	Has anyone on here ever used git with org-mode to edit a document on a team?
Jan 26 22:15:26 <grym>	technically yes but not really 
Jan 26 22:15:39 <brandflake11>	Did you ever have any issues with merging changes?
Jan 26 22:17:17 <ldlework>	is there a command to repeat last M-: evaluation?
Jan 26 22:17:45 <bremner>	M-: M-p ?
Jan 26 22:18:18 <DanC>	so... I moved .dir-locals.el and replaced it with a symlink... now emacs doesn't seem to respect changes to it.
Jan 26 22:20:19 <ldlework>	bremner: so slow :P
Jan 26 22:20:22 <Wafficus>	I am getting the following error: Invalid capture target specification: (file+heading "~/documents/workFolder2021/Todo List (2021).org" "* Open Tasks")

Jan 26 22:23:05 <ldlework>	dale it repeats the last command which can be changed by the code you're evaluating
Jan 26 22:23:07 <DanC>	dale, any clues on how to get emacs to respect changes to .dir-locals.el ?
Jan 26 22:23:07 <ldlework>	:P
Jan 26 22:23:22 <dale>	DanC: I do not, assuming your symlink is correct and readable.
Jan 26 22:23:46 <DanC>	yes... when I start a new emacs, it respects .dir-locals.el
Jan 26 22:24:06 <dale>	DanC: And you're doing revert-buffer every time after a change to dir-locals?
Jan 26 22:24:09 <DanC>	but if I then change .dir-locals.el , revert-buffer has no effect
Jan 26 22:24:28 <dale>	DanC: And you're reverting the buffer that should be using the dir-locals variables, not the .dir-locals.el buffer itself, right?
Jan 26 22:24:38 <DanC>	correct
Jan 26 22:28:30 <dale>	DanC: I can reproduce here, I think setting dir-locals-directory-cache to nil fixed it, so I think this implies some mistaken caching perhaps.
Jan 26 22:28:51 <Wafficus>	do I need to escape the parentheses in the Todo list file name itself?
Jan 26 22:29:22 <DanC>	dir-locals-directory-cache ... I was hunting for something like that with C-h v but didn't see it...
Jan 26 22:30:27 <dale>	DanC: What OS are you on?
Jan 26 22:30:31 <DanC>	linux
Jan 26 22:30:41 <srid>	Damn, emacs has built-in tab bar? TIL!
Jan 26 22:30:41 <srid>	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Tab-Bars.html
Jan 26 22:30:59 <technomancy>	it's not evry good
Jan 26 22:31:06 <technomancy>	hardly emacs's fault
Jan 26 22:32:08 <DanC>	whew! mystery solved. thanks again, dave
Jan 26 22:32:25 <technomancy>	it's just that tab bars themselves are inherently not a great idea
Jan 26 22:34:04 <dale>	DanC: How did you solve it?  Are you just clearing that cache variable every time you need .dir-locals.el reloaded?
Jan 26 22:34:10 <beep1560>	Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? [ https://pastebin.com/raw/UfT57f8C ] I've defined a function to compute a value in "ibuffer-formats" but "ibuffer" throws an error when calling it.
Jan 26 22:34:44 <DanC>	yes.
Jan 26 22:34:59 <dale>	I actually can't see why changes to the linked .dir-locals.el are not being seen.
Jan 26 22:35:33 <DanC>	https://github.com/dckc/emacs-dev/blob/master/moddable-c-style/.dir-locals.el#L3
Jan 26 22:35:41 <bad_blue_bull>	good way to conditionally include element into list?  Like (append (when t '(666)) (list 1 2 3)) ?
Jan 26 22:36:48 <wasamasa>	you discovered it
Jan 26 22:37:05 <bad_blue_bull>	I didn't know if something better exists
Jan 26 22:37:11 <wasamasa>	it can be a bit shorter with `(,@(when t '(666)) 1 2 3)
Jan 26 22:37:22 <bad_blue_bull>	thanks
Jan 26 22:37:23 <wasamasa>	which does pretty much the same
Jan 26 22:37:45 <dale>	Oh, there it is, I missed dir-locals-find-file returns a cons, so hack-dir-local-variables uses cached values from dir-locals-class-alist.
Jan 26 22:38:10 <dale>	DanC: I think you should report a bug that changes to .dir-locals.el are not picked up when .dir-locals.el is a symlink.  Surely it should follow the link.
Jan 26 22:45:18 <DanC>	ugh... I did M-x report-emacs-bug and wrote it up... now it's prompting me for an SMTP server
Jan 26 22:45:55 <DanC>	I guess I can copy/paste to my usual mailer...
Jan 26 22:47:53 <DanC>	sent Tue, 26 Jan 2021 15:47:21 -0600
Jan 26 22:47:59 <ldlework>	Made me a nice import fixer for Typescript, https://i.imgur.com/HuR0gp4.gif
Jan 26 22:48:36 <dale>	DanC: Thanks. :)
Jan 26 22:48:46 <DanC>	least I could do
Jan 26 22:48:59 <dale>	DanC: Yeah, in any recent Emacs I think there's even a shortcut in that buffer that somehow means "send this email with my normal mailer" or "copy to clipboard for me" or something.
Jan 26 22:49:36 <dale>	ldlework: Did you actually implement that in a TypeScript LSP server?  It looks like you're invoking something through LSP there.
Jan 26 22:50:01 <ldlework>	dale: I'm using tide-mode to do most of the work, but I used embrace to unify the import quoting types, and spacing
Jan 26 22:50:14 <ldlework>	dale: thanks for the tip
Jan 26 22:52:47 <nij>	Which regex standard does rx follow?
Jan 26 22:53:03 <wasamasa>	it's no different from what emacs implements
Jan 26 22:53:09 <wasamasa>	a variation of POSIX regex
Jan 26 22:53:25 <nij>	"Emacs regex"?
Jan 26 22:53:36 <wasamasa>	yes, you can use regex without rx, lol
Jan 26 22:53:54 <nij>	I just want to choose a standard to learn first.
Jan 26 22:54:04 <nij>	Having bad regex-fu has been a huge problem.
Jan 26 22:54:10 <wasamasa>	doesn't hurt to learn the POSIX stuff
Jan 26 22:54:39 <nij>	I also want to use rx at the end.. so
Jan 26 22:54:48 <nij>	should learn emacs regex too.

Jan 27 18:48:08 <remby>	how do you have emacs quit even when processes are running in the background?
Jan 27 18:48:48 <JordiGH>	You say "yes" when it asks?
Jan 27 18:48:53 <seabass>	I suppose the Emacs daemon allows you to close all the windows (frames)
Jan 27 18:48:58 <seabass>	without stopping the daemon
Jan 27 18:49:24 <remby>	JordiGH: yeah I want to do it without answering the prompt
Jan 27 18:52:54 <cvandusen>	,dv confirm-kill-emacs
Jan 27 18:52:54 <fsbot>	How to ask for confirmation when leaving Emacs.
Jan 27 18:52:55 <fsbot>	If nil, the default, don’t ask at all.  If the value is non-nil, it should
Jan 27 18:52:55 <fsbot>	be a predicate function; for example ‘yes-or-no-p’.
Jan 27 18:52:55 <fsbot>	You can customize this variable.
Jan 27 18:52:55 <fsbot>	Defined in `/usr/share/emacs/26.1/lisp/files.elc'.
Jan 27 18:52:58 <irek>	remby: you can use M-x kill-emacs interactive function
Jan 27 18:54:05 <irek>	but in that case you won't be asked about running processes or unsaved files, continue with caution ;d
Jan 27 18:54:57 <parsnip>	you can use C-x s to check for files to save
Jan 27 18:55:35 <remby>	thanks
Jan 27 18:57:12 <seabass>	Hello
Jan 27 18:57:50 <beep1560>	Eshell users, how do you compare command outputs? In zsh, I would do "$ diff -u <(seq 1 2) <(seq 
Jan 27 18:57:51 <beep1560>	I'm asknig this because Eshell shows the following when trying that: Eshell does not support input redirection
Jan 27 18:57:51 <beep1560>	seabass: hello  :)
Jan 27 18:57:59 <seabass>	beep1560, afternoon
Jan 27 18:58:09 <seabass>	for me
Jan 27 18:58:28 <seabass>	evening/morning/afternoon/night please choose which one applies :)
Jan 27 18:59:16 <natter>	beep1560: redirect to a buffer and then diff buffers
Jan 27 19:01:00 <seabass>	Why would my .emacs be write-protected?
Jan 27 19:02:07 <seabass>	It feels a bit ridiculous modifying it with Vim
Jan 27 19:02:48 <rpav>	it's the new functional-style configuration, everything is immutable
Jan 27 19:02:58 <seabass>	in emacs?
Jan 27 19:03:13 <seabass>	ahem leg-pulling alert just went off
Jan 27 19:03:22 <beep1560>	natter: Is there any lisp function for inserting the content of a command to an specific buffer?
Jan 27 19:03:23 <rpav>	nah i'm just being ridiculous .. why *is* it write-protected? is this windows?
Jan 27 19:03:34 <seabass>	rpav, nope it's Fedora
Jan 27 19:03:41 <seabass>	I saved it with Vim just fine
Jan 27 19:03:43 <natter>	beep1560: seq 1 2 > #<buffer foo>
Jan 27 19:03:48 <rpav>	seabass: is the file -w?
Jan 27 19:03:52 <irek>	seabass: edit Emacs config in Vim :DD funny and tragic
Jan 27 19:04:03 <JordiGH>	I've had to edit my .emacs in vim when I've broken it so badly that I can't edit it with Emacs :(
Jan 27 19:04:05 <JordiGH>	I am not proud.
Jan 27 19:04:11 <rpav>	emacs -Q D:
Jan 27 19:04:16 <rpav>	or whatever
Jan 27 19:04:22 <JordiGH>	I guess I could have done emacs -Q ~/.emacs but I honestly forget how to use emacs -Q
Jan 27 19:04:25 <seabass>	+w?
Jan 27 19:04:39 <rpav>	JordiGH: fair, i can barely get around in vanilla myself
Jan 27 19:04:49 <cvandusen>	alias it to `eq'
Jan 27 19:05:03 <seabass>	what? Now it just works...
Jan 27 19:05:14 <rpav>	weird
Jan 27 19:05:44 <seabass>	M-x doctor
Jan 27 19:05:47 <seabass>	am I seeing things?
Jan 27 19:06:38 <cvandusen>	,doctor my eyes 
Jan 27 19:06:38 <fsbot>	Why do you say your eyes? 
Jan 27 19:07:01 <cvandusen>	jackson browne, duh 
Jan 27 19:07:20 <srid>	When using `define-derived-mode` (I'm doing this to override `markdown-mode` with some customizations), what is the idiomatic way to bind some keybindings only for this mode? Specifically I want to bind TAB to `complete-symbol`.
Jan 27 19:07:39 <srid>	I don't think you can use `global-set-key`
Jan 27 19:07:53 <srid>	Because I want the keybinding to be local to the derived mode
Jan 27 19:09:43 <srid>	I tried `local-set-key` but doesn't work at all.
Jan 27 19:10:39 <dale>	srid: If you're deriving a mode, then you probably want to make a new keymap for that derived mode, and set that up as the local map.  You can make the derived mode's keymap inherit from markdown-mode's keymap.
Jan 27 19:10:44 <srid>	Here's my config: https://pastebin.com/raw/eS1YDUvN
Jan 27 19:11:10 <dale>	srid: I would suggest looking at a simple minor mode somewhere and how it sets up a keymap.
Jan 27 19:11:31 <seabass>	How can I set a key to a Lisp function?
Jan 27 19:11:44 <dale>	srid: Ah, you might also be interested in M-x find-variable RET gfm-mode-map RET.
Jan 27 19:12:19 <dale>	srid: I *think* gfm-mode is a major mode derived from markdown-mode.  (gfm = GitHub-flavored Markdown)
Jan 27 19:12:40 <dale>	srid: (And I guess I should have said "I would suggest looking at a simple *major* mode somewhere" above.)
Jan 27 19:13:22 <dale>	seabass: define-key.  The Elisp function must start with (interactive).  If it doesn't then you should modify it or wrap it.
Jan 27 19:13:36 <seabass>	dale, so not global-set-key?
Jan 27 19:13:46 <srid>	Cool, dale , here's another example: https://github.com/felko/neuron-mode/blob/master/neuron-mode.el#L1202
Jan 27 19:13:48 <dale>	seabass: You can do that if you want to bind the key in global-map.
Jan 27 19:14:19 <seabass>	what?
Jan 27 19:14:30 <seabass>	bye bye everyone
Jan 27 19:14:47 <mplsCorwin>	o_O
Jan 27 19:14:59 <seabass>	is this a netsplit?
Jan 27 19:15:14 <seabass>	hmm they're all irccloud connections
Jan 27 19:15:16 <mplsCorwin>	ah, yeah, probably so.  seen a few today
Jan 27 19:15:23 <seabass>	anyway, hello mplsCorwin
Jan 27 19:15:33 <mplsCorwin>	o/ seabass :)   how do?
Jan 27 19:15:37 <seabass>	great :)
Jan 27 19:15:39 <seabass>	and you?
Jan 27 19:16:17 <mplsCorwin>	pretty good! had some struggles to start the year but feeling pretty decent now and starting to approach actual productivity.
Jan 27 19:16:50 <seabass>	good to hear that. I'm feeling a similar way, what with all the lockdown stuff here
Jan 27 19:17:13 <seabass>	everything changes every week! </grumble>
Jan 27 19:17:18 <seabass>	did slondr, bandali and you ever find a solution?
Jan 27 19:17:51 <mplsCorwin>	sorry, context has fallen out of my brain and become lost in the soup.
Jan 27 19:17:59 <seabass>	video streaming
Jan 27 19:18:17 <seabass>	on #video-conferencing-tools
Jan 27 19:18:52 <mplsCorwin>	ah, ah!  Not sure.  we decided to fold that channel into #fsf or #jami etc.
Jan 27 19:19:31 <seabass>	mplsCorwin, OK - tell me if you need a guinea pig for testing IceCast or what have you :)
Jan 27 19:19:55 <mplsCorwin>	absolutely :D
Jan 27 19:25:46 <seabass>	So I've put, at the end of my .emacs file, global-set-key etc etc
Jan 27 19:25:57 <seabass>	But I get C-c u is undefined...
Jan 27 19:26:04 <seabass>	(global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") (subed-mpv-playback-speed 1))
Jan 27 19:27:17 <dale>	seabass: The second arg to global-set-key should be a command, it doesn't take an arbitrary form to evaluate.
Jan 27 19:27:29 <dale>	seabass: A command is just a function that has an (interactive) form.
Jan 27 19:28:18 <dale>	seabass: (defun my-mpv-reset-playback-speed () (interactive) (subed-mpv-playback-speed 1)) (global-set-key (kbd "C-c u") 'my-mpv-reset-playback-speed)
Jan 27 19:30:01 <johnjay>	i'm a bit surprised emacs doesn't follow the convention of a decimal indicating floating point
Jan 27 19:30:07 <johnjay>	,(/ 2.0 5)
Jan 27 19:30:07 <fsbot>	0.4  ..(float)
Jan 27 19:30:09 <johnjay>	,(/ 2. 5)
Jan 27 19:30:10 <fsbot>	0  ..(integer)
Jan 27 19:31:32 <dale>	Huh, me too.
Jan 27 19:31:51 <dale>	Was floating point always in Emacs, or is it a relatively recent addition?
Jan 27 19:32:08 <johnjay>	i assume it was always there
Jan 27 19:32:17 <johnjay>	the convention itself is probably more recent
Jan 27 19:32:35 <johnjay>	i was playing around in octave and i noticed the code i was reading was inserting the . a lot
Jan 27 19:32:46 <johnjay>	but it wasn't necessary because octave doesn't do integer division
Jan 27 19:33:14 <seabass>	dale, you are very helpful :)
Jan 27 19:33:37 <seabass>	thank you very much. That works now - presumably I'd need to do that for every function that wasn't already interactive
Jan 27 19:34:13 <dale>	johnjay: I think you're right that it's been in there a very long time, at least.
Jan 27 19:34:26 <dale>	seabass: Yes, or when you need to provide any arguments.
Jan 27 19:35:27 <seabass>	Actually, the functions are interactive, so it must have been the latter that was needed
Jan 27 19:37:11 <seabass>	has anyone here had RSI? I'm... starting to feel something :/
Jan 27 19:37:30 <rpav>	yeah; start by getting a better keyboard
Jan 27 19:37:54 <seabass>	A thumb-cluster one would be handy; is that the sort of one you have?
Jan 27 19:38:06 <seabass>	lol 'handy' :D
Jan 27 19:38:07 <rpav>	well .. start by having everything position right, not reaching too far for mouse, not twisting your hand/finger for ctrl, etc
Jan 27 19:38:16 <rpav>	but a good keyboard is probably the 2nd step
Jan 27 19:38:43 <rpav>	i have a datahand but sadly you can't get those anymore 
Jan 27 19:38:44 <seabass>	Not twising ones hand for ctrl... how do you do that?
Jan 27 19:38:52 <grym>	seabass: rebind capslock 
Jan 27 19:39:04 <seabass>	grym, I'm on Colemak, so that's backspace
Jan 27 19:39:10 <seabass>	'taken'!
Jan 27 19:39:13 <grym>	i'm one of the ergodox weirdoes
Jan 27 19:39:28 <seabass>	ah, sadly this isn't programable at the hardware level
Jan 27 19:39:28 <rpav>	been looking at the ergodox or moonlander thing but only as potential replacement or alternative, but i want super light touch switches
Jan 27 19:39:52 <rpav>	seabass: you *can* use an alternate hand, but i remap caps lock to control
Jan 27 19:40:17 <rpav>	err yeah what grym said .. you can make it work on console etc even
Jan 27 19:40:38 <grym>	rpav: the keyswitches are hot-swappable, it's very good
Jan 27 19:40:46 <grym>	you can put many things there
Jan 27 19:40:50 <natter>	let's all use footpedals
Jan 27 19:40:56 <seabass>	alright, I'll look into rebinding capslock
Jan 27 19:41:03 <seabass>	natter, do you play the organ? :)
Jan 27 19:41:20 <natter>	no but I have browsed the kinesis catalog
Jan 27 19:41:36 <seabass>	ahah :) Well I can just about play the pedals
Jan 27 19:41:37 <parsnip>	what's a good way to share a private list of tasks, regarding a github project, ideally with ways to change urgency of a task, or add labels, etc
Jan 27 19:41:38 <grym>	i'd probably want an ergodox-ez or moonlander over kinesis 
Jan 27 19:41:44 <grym>	for maintainability if nothing else
Jan 27 19:41:50 <parsnip>	does microsoft tasks have sharing?
Jan 27 19:41:59 <parsnip>	s/tasks/todo/
Jan 27 19:42:07 <grym>	parsnip: what's that self-hosted trello clone? 
Jan 27 19:42:16 <seabass>	urgh, Microsoft tasks? :P
Jan 27 19:42:20 <grym>	libreboard?
Jan 27 19:42:40 <parsnip>	it doesn't have to be anti-spyware, just not public
Jan 27 19:42:54 <parsnip>	ironically, i would prefer ease of use
Jan 27 19:42:59 <grym>	oh, wekan now 
Jan 27 19:43:05 <seabass>	grym, the ergodox is nice; what keycaps might you use? I think it has special shaped ones
Jan 27 19:43:07 <grym>	parsnip: https://wekan.github.io/ perhaps 
Jan 27 19:43:11 <parsnip>	ironic because the github project is a taskwarrior mobile app
Jan 27 19:43:21 <grym>	seabass: i have their default keycaps for now, but i have space cadets on order :) 
Jan 27 19:43:34 <seabass>	ahah. very retro :)
Jan 27 19:43:40 *	parsnip looks for demo page
Jan 27 19:43:44 <seabass>	you'll have an actual super key then?
Jan 27 19:43:45 <grym>	i'm stoked, they look gorgeous 
Jan 27 19:43:47 <parsnip>	grym: i think i don't want to self-host
Jan 27 19:43:54 <parsnip>	everything else about this project is hard enough
Jan 27 19:43:55 <db48x>	seabass: you're not supposed to try to hit two keys with one hand. keyboards have to control keys for a reason
Jan 27 19:44:11 <grym>	parsnip: then just use gh projects https://github.com/features/project-management/ 
Jan 27 19:44:34 <seabass>	db48x, the right control key is very far away
Jan 27 19:44:42 <seabass>	so I have to leave the home row to reach it
Jan 27 19:44:43 <parsnip>	can i have complex lists that are not public?
Jan 27 19:44:45 <grym>	seabass: renders https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=105375.0 
Jan 27 19:44:50 <natter>	db48x: tell that to C-M-!
Jan 27 19:45:05 <parsnip>	oh, maybe a taskwarrior compatible list like trello would be a little funny
Jan 27 19:45:13 <seabass>	grym, that's lovely
Jan 27 19:45:23 <db48x>	natter: :)
Jan 27 19:45:30 <seabass>	looks like the original, but teeny-tiny :)
Jan 27 19:45:33 <grym>	seabass: yeah! ordered them in april 2020, they'll probably be here july 2021 ..? 
Jan 27 19:45:38 <parsnip>	i'd have to do like `HOME=~/.trello task` or something
Jan 27 19:45:48 <grym>	seabass: well, it's just the caps, so they're going on an ergodox
Jan 27 19:46:24 <seabass>	grym, ah, another victom of industrial^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H coronavirus disease, then

Jan 27 19:46:51 <seabass>	although I would always prioritise the safety of factory workers over shipping times
Jan 27 19:46:51 <aidalgol>	seabass: what?
Jan 27 19:46:52 <grym>	seabass: no, small scale keycap manufacturer runs alllllways take a god's age
Jan 27 19:47:10 <seabass>	ah, OK grym, so it's nothing unusual if that's the case!
Jan 27 19:47:10 <grym>	waiting 3 years for a drop is not unheard of at all 
Jan 27 19:47:18 <seabass>	wow, you have to be patient
Jan 27 19:47:25 <grym>	seabass: small scale nerd manufacture is like this in any sector you care to name 
Jan 27 19:47:31 <aidalgol>	massdrop?
Jan 27 19:47:32 <grym>	i know bicycle makers with a 10 year waitlist
Jan 27 19:47:32 <seabass>	Amazon would have you believe that one-day delivey is it
Jan 27 19:47:43 <grym>	which sucks because peter's 67 or so now 
Jan 27 19:47:48 <parsnip>	rudybot: seen oni-on-ion
Jan 27 19:47:49 <rudybot>	parsnip: oni-on-ion was seen in #emacs two weeks ago, saying "=)", and then oni-on-ion was seen quitting two weeks ago, saying "Remote host closed the connection"
Jan 27 19:47:50 <grym>	so getting in line is a *gamble*
Jan 27 19:47:56 <aidalgol>	grym: Who's peter?
Jan 27 19:48:02 <grym>	man makes goddamn gorgeous bikes though.  
Jan 27 19:48:14 <parsnip>	oni-on-ion got the keyboard i just got, a few weeks before
Jan 27 19:48:19 <grym>	aidalgol: the maker of this bike https://www.renehersecycles.com/j-p-weigle-for-the-concours-de-machines/ 
Jan 27 19:48:27 <grym>	he doesn't even have a website 
Jan 27 19:48:30 <aidalgol>	ah
Jan 27 19:48:31 <grym>	he has a flickr page sometimies 
Jan 27 19:48:37 <grym>	but you just kind of ... call his house
Jan 27 19:48:39 <grym>	send him a check?
Jan 27 19:48:41 <seabass>	grym, you clearly like craft goods
Jan 27 19:48:41 <grym>	and wait
Jan 27 19:48:49 <seabass>	It's a very neat bike
Jan 27 19:48:51 <grym>	seabass: when it's worth it, absolutely 
Jan 27 19:48:52 <parsnip>	grym: how do i go about making a nice beater/burner bike?
Jan 27 19:49:09 <aidalgol>	What's better about a bespoke bike over a manufactured bike?
Jan 27 19:49:26 <seabass>	so his workshop must be filled with cutting and forming tools I imagine
Jan 27 19:49:31 <aidalgol>	Aside from hipster cred, I mean.
Jan 27 19:49:47 <parsnip>	i think custom bikes can potentially fit you better
Jan 27 19:49:54 <grym>	parsnip: find your local bike hippie collective masquerading as a bike shop, get a steel frame from the 80s that has at least JIS square taper cranks, and slap a bigass u-lock on it and replace every single quickrelease with a bolt 
Jan 27 19:49:57 <parsnip>	and thus be more comfortable and efficient
Jan 27 19:50:14 <parsnip>	but fitting a bike is probably more expensive than finding someone that knows how to tune gears
Jan 27 19:50:16 <grym>	a bike that fits you will be always better; it doesn't matter much for short trips
Jan 27 19:50:23 <grym>	where short is ~50 miles 
Jan 27 19:50:32 <parsnip>	yeah, it's not currently worth it for me
Jan 27 19:50:38 <parsnip>	i guess
Jan 27 19:50:45 <parsnip>	cost/benefit
Jan 27 19:50:46 <grym>	but if you're gonna go cross country or something, you do want a bike that's the right shape
Jan 27 19:51:03 <aidalgol>	ah, gotcha
Jan 27 19:51:18 <parsnip>	i _have_ noticed "man this bike doesn't even feel shaped right"
Jan 27 19:51:24 <grym>	aidalgol: peter builds his bikes for randonneurs, who are self supported competitive amateur cyclists who travel very long distances
Jan 27 19:51:25 <parsnip>	like, on my previous bike
Jan 27 19:51:45 <aidalgol>	grym: Got a question for ya about the AI industry.
Jan 27 19:51:45 <grym>	parsnip: yeah i rode a tiny-ass mongoose frame for years; i looked a bit like donkey kong 
Jan 27 19:51:49 <grym>	aidalgol: shoot
Jan 27 19:52:18 <aidalgol>	grym: You know all those toy apps and websites where you upload your photo and get a silly image generated from it?
Jan 27 19:52:19 <grym>	parsnip: wound up putting bullhorns on it just so i could get some stretch out.  my current ride fits me quite well 
Jan 27 19:52:19 <parsnip>	grym: is it A Bad Idea to try to be cheap _and_ start by just buying the frame?
Jan 27 19:52:30 <aidalgol>	Like faceapp and toonme.
Jan 27 19:52:40 <grym>	parsnip: frame-up is usually objectively better but it's not where i'd buy a beater bike at.  how tall are you? 
Jan 27 19:52:45 <grym>	parsnip: and what's your inseam?
Jan 27 19:52:48 <dale>	grym: Do you have an iPhone?
Jan 27 19:52:57 <grym>	dale: i do 
Jan 27 19:53:06 <grym>	aidalgol: sure, i know of them 
Jan 27 19:53:14 <dale>	grym: Do you take long bike rides in temps of 32°F or lower with your iPhone?
Jan 27 19:53:32 <aidalgol>	grym: Are they mostly all honeypots for getting training data for facial recognition products?
Jan 27 19:53:37 <dale>	grym: Let's define "long" as "at least thirty minutes, preferably upwards of fourty-five".
Jan 27 19:53:38 <grym>	dale: 20-ish miles or so 
Jan 27 19:53:43 <dale>	forty-five
Jan 27 19:53:45 <grym>	dale: sure. yes, i've done that a bunch
Jan 27 19:53:56 <seabass>	I don't know, what would a parsnip riding a bike look like?
Jan 27 19:54:03 <seabass>	https://x0.at/tN1.png
Jan 27 19:54:07 <dale>	grym: Do you ever pull your iPhone out and have it shut down very shortly afterwards?
Jan 27 19:54:18 <parsnip>	lol
Jan 27 19:54:39 <grym>	aidalgol: afaik no, it's mostly funded by things like snap or instagram and they want user engagement for eyes for ads more than they want facial recognition as such 
Jan 27 19:54:45 <grym>	aidalgol: but you can't rule it out 
Jan 27 19:56:17 <grym>	dale: no, i don't see that.  i had that happen when i had navigation on on my phone and it was mounted in direct sun on a hot day
Jan 27 19:56:35 <grym>	dale: i tend to ride with it tucked up against the small of my back in a jersey pocket, so it stays fairly warm 
Jan 27 19:56:36 <dale>	grym: I regularly have my 6s die on me when I pull it out during a run in cold weather.  Not sure if this is my phone, or the 6s, or just all iPhones, or just any phone with an Li-ion battery.  Accounts on the Internet run the gamut.
Jan 27 19:57:00 <dale>	grym: Ah.  I've got mine in a belt pouch on my front.  Sometimes I pull it out to change what I'm listening to.
Jan 27 19:57:08 <grym>	dale: i notice a faster battery drain while skiing, but i've never figured out if it's "trying and failing to get a signal all the time" or thermal effects
Jan 27 19:57:13 <aidalgol>	grym: So how does it help those businesses?  Because it makes people share the silly generated images on their platforms?
Jan 27 19:57:14 <dale>	grym: Thanks for the data point.
Jan 27 19:57:17 <dale>	grym: #whynotboth
Jan 27 19:57:32 <grym>	dale: i think it's probably both.  i tend to keep it in airplane mode skiing now 
Jan 27 19:57:43 <dale>	grym: I will actually lay some blame on YouTube Music, which gets *very* angry when you block doubleclick.net.
Jan 27 19:59:42 <dale>	As a side note, if anyone knows of a small "hand warmer" sort of heater in a roughly rectangular phone shape, one that won't set my mostly sealed belt pouch on fire, I'd be glad to have a link to it.
Jan 27 19:59:44 <parsnip>	ugh, i hate the threading in gitter
Jan 27 20:00:04 <parsnip>	"tepid hand warmer"
Jan 27 20:00:06 <parsnip>	;)
Jan 27 20:00:15 <dale>	I jammed a chemical hand warmer in with my phone but it doesn't put out enough heat.
Jan 27 20:00:50 <dale>	parsnip: I'm mostly worried about putting one of the gas-powered heaters in my pouch.
Jan 27 20:02:32 <grym>	dale: there's the... yeah, those 
Jan 27 20:02:38 <grym>	they freak me out a bit too 
Jan 27 20:03:15 <dale>	I have one or two of the electric heaters, but the ones I have are too bulky and non-rectangular to fit comfortably when jammed against my waist with my phone.
Jan 27 20:03:27 <dale>	I would love something vaguely credit card sized.
Jan 27 20:04:06 <dale>	I'm 30% surprised that someone doesn't just make heated phone cases for iPhones.  I ran into some Kickstarter/IndieGoGo things that looked mostly unsuccessful.
Jan 27 20:04:08 <mplsCorwin>	dale: my son has something like what you describe for track meets and cross-country.  I'll see if I can find out what exactly it is.  It's got some metal things in that you bend then it gets hot.  you boil it to recharge.
Jan 27 20:04:43 <dale>	mplsCorwin: Huh, OK, thanks!  He actually uses it to warm a phone or similar?
Jan 27 20:05:56 <mplsCorwin>	it's really for his hands but I think he has the phone in his mitten
Jan 27 20:06:02 <dale>	I did also get my battery replaced.  It was barely a year old, probably shouldn't have been necessary, but I suspect that also improved the situation for me.  (I'm waiting for it to get super-cold again.)
Jan 27 20:06:41 <dale>	mplsCorwin: Phone... in mitten...  Now I want to see the mittens. :)
Jan 27 20:06:51 <dale>	And/or the phone.
Jan 27 20:08:46 <dale>	Maybe I should try and figure out a better way to keep the phone near my body for warmth.
Jan 27 20:11:48 <grym>	aidalgol: i think filters and stuff help snap by keeping users engaged, and we all lie to ourselves that this drives ad clicks 
Jan 27 20:24:49 <natter>	rudybot: what is our engagement like here?
Jan 27 20:24:59 <rudybot>	natter: Our rules of engagement were extremely strict in both Afghanistan and Iraq, and, speaking for my unit, we followed them to the letter.
Jan 27 20:25:44 <bremner>	say what you will about killer-robots, they follow the rules
Jan 27 20:30:08 <frdg>	for some reason `auto-complete-mode` always gives me an option for the completion in all caps. I have no idea why or how it does this. For example the menu will popup with both `config` and `CONFIG` I can't find any settings or documentation about this.
Jan 27 20:33:42 <mplsCorwin>	dale: they are Hot To Go packs from htglife.com
Jan 27 20:37:56 <dale>	mplsCorwin: Thanks, I appreciate it!  Even if they don't work for my phone, maybe I should use those instead of the disposable chemical ones I've been using.
Jan 27 20:39:23 <mplsCorwin>	his tip is "get a bunch, they don't last that long"
Jan 27 20:40:00 <dale>	Noted
Jan 27 20:57:40 <aidalgol>	https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street
Jan 27 20:57:44 <aidalgol>	"Stocks are memes now"
Jan 27 20:59:26 <tromey>	... they always were
Jan 27 20:59:26 <grym>	"always has been"
Jan 27 20:59:29 <tromey>	lol
Jan 27 20:59:58 <aidalgol>	* grym pulls trigger, shooting tromey in the haid
Jan 27 20:59:59 <johnjay>	stocks-mode in emacs seems like it could work
Jan 27 21:00:12 <johnjay>	the problem is i don't know how complicated ncurses layouts get
Jan 27 21:00:12 <tromey>	haha yeah
Jan 27 21:00:28 <aidalgol>	johnjay: If you're going to do that and not name it stonks-mode, then... well, I'll just be very disappointed.
Jan 27 21:00:34 <johnjay>	haha
Jan 27 21:00:43 <grym>	evil-stonks
