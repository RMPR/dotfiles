Mar 23 19:42:11 <Nickwiz>	Does vim check string from first byte each time one look up an index?
Mar 23 19:42:29 <lopid>	why use many word
Mar 23 19:42:31 <ivaat>	https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/arMVGw7_700bwp.webp
Mar 23 19:43:14 <Nickwiz>	hah
Mar 23 19:45:45 <SvenG>	Nickwiz: whenever you look up an index (eg of a book) - vim checks on you.  :-P
Mar 23 19:46:41 <phy1729>	ivaat: images of text are terrible things. Plus the original looks like https://twitter.com/Don_Watkins/status/1353173907528949771
Mar 23 19:48:18 <ivaat>	huh
Mar 23 19:52:00 <CcxWrk>	Horrendous slurry of JavaScript to serve short text message is at least as bad.
Mar 23 19:52:10 <SvenG>	then again, the webp has 11KB and the javascript 200+KB
Mar 23 19:56:49 <phy1729>	True, but channels that share tweets often usually have a bot
Mar 23 20:04:20 <Nickwiz>	Baha, - well. It does not have much of a choice perhaps. A simple bench: loop index of string 20.0 sec, on array/list 1.6 sec
Mar 23 20:04:49 <Nickwiz>	And the split by \ze only add 0.2 sec to that
Mar 23 20:05:02 <Nickwiz>	so 1.8 vs 20.0 I guess
Mar 23 20:09:51 <crose>	how did you get these measures?
Mar 23 20:12:33 <Nickwiz>	Using :profile
Mar 23 20:14:09 <crose>	sorry, I meant which Vim script did you use?

Mar 23 20:39:44 <crose>	ah my bad
Mar 23 20:40:00 <crose>	the paths need to be adapted when you've compiled Vim in a different location
Mar 23 20:42:56 <crose>	new results: https://0x0.st/-qQA.txt, https://0x0.st/-qQB.txt
Mar 23 20:43:13 <crose>	now, let's see if it can be optimized
Mar 23 20:57:49 <Nickwiz>	:)
Mar 23 21:10:55 <ash_worksi>	is there a way to move up/down 1 screen AND move the cursor to the top/bottom of the screen?
Mar 23 21:11:08 <ash_worksi>	or do you just have to move the cursor first?
Mar 23 21:15:05 <SvenG>	ash_worksi: CTRL-B/CTRL-F followed by H or L
Mar 23 21:15:33 <crose>	> :)
Mar 23 21:15:37 <crose>	I found a bug :(
Mar 23 21:15:45 <ash_worksi>	thanks
Mar 23 21:21:46 <neo4>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcEeSQevZQc

Mar 23 21:25:52 <SvenG>	maybe there is no match to be found? ;)
Mar 23 21:26:13 <cuppajoeman>	Yeah, but it doesn't try and do the other two SvenG
Mar 23 21:26:28 <SvenG>	well, when it fails.. why continue?
Mar 23 21:26:31 <cuppajoeman>	Thank you phy1729
Mar 23 21:26:42 <cuppajoeman>	Because even if one thing isn't there, that's fine replace the others
Mar 23 21:26:54 <SvenG>	that's your interpretation
Mar 23 21:26:56 <cuppajoeman>	nothing needs to be replaced if theres no instance of it in the text
Mar 23 21:27:09 <SvenG>	it's the default behaviour with programs. when error.. stop!
Mar 23 21:27:17 <cuppajoeman>	I agree with that
Mar 23 21:27:48 <SvenG>	well.. use the "e" flag then.  "continue!"
Mar 23 21:28:09 <cuppajoeman>	yup, learning about it now

Mar 23 21:41:58 <phy1729>	vimgor: learnvim
Mar 23 21:41:58 <SvenG>	sabasedigh: "vimtutor" should be installed with vim.  it calls vim on a copy of the tutor text which you can then modify safely

Mar 23 22:11:35 <davidfetter_work>	hi
Mar 23 22:13:03 <davidfetter_work>	is there a plan to have a vim 8.3, and if so, where's discussion happening? I checked the GH page, but that repo appears to be a mirror of just the part of whatever Bram & co are using that pertains to 8.2 at the moment.
Mar 23 22:13:39 <lopid>	vim-dev mailing list, if anywhere
Mar 23 22:14:05 <davidfetter_work>	thanks :)
Mar 23 22:14:13 <nickspoon>	I don't think there will be an 8.3 though
Mar 23 22:14:24 <nickspoon>	I expect the next version will be 9.0
Mar 23 22:14:28 <davidfetter_work>	TIL :)
Mar 23 22:15:53 <moon-child>	idk, https://github.com/brammool/vim9 seems dead
Mar 23 22:16:35 <nickspoon>	moon-child: for a while I believe Bram was developing vim9script in that fork
Mar 23 22:16:48 <nickspoon>	But now he's just doing it in the main repo
Mar 23 22:17:08 <nickspoon>	Now that it is not experimental, and is the definite way forward
Mar 23 22:21:40 <osse>	praise gaben---I mean bram
Mar 23 22:22:13 <Brutus>	both? both
Mar 23 22:22:20 <SvenG>	http://of-vim-and-vigor.blogspot.com/2014/08/learning-tool-of-vim.html ::: https://github.com/dahu/LearnVim
Mar 23 22:22:24 <SvenG>	oops
Mar 23 22:22:27 <SvenG>	https://www.guckes.net/tig.vim-8.2.2648.png :-)
Mar 23 22:23:00 <hahuang65>	why does this give me a trailing characters error: nnoremap <silent> <leader>tf :Ultest <bar> :UltestSummaryOpen<CR>
Mar 23 22:24:22 <nickspoon>	hahuang65: not sure if it's the problem but you don't need an extra : before UltestSummaryOpen
Mar 23 22:24:57 <hahuang65>	yeah, that wasn't the problem, but I fixed that, thanks!
Mar 23 22:25:51 <nickspoon>	Try removing the spaces around <bar> ?
Mar 23 22:26:21 <nickspoon>	Otherwise it might have to do with the commands themselves, if they allow <bar>
Mar 23 22:27:39 <hahuang65>	no dice :\
Mar 23 22:31:58 <nickspoon>	what is the output of :command Ultest  ? Does it have a `|` at the start?
Mar 23 22:33:21 <davidfetter_work>	SvenG, belated thanks for the helpful configs over the years. I've spent a lot less time messing around with vim and mutt in frustruation than I would have, had they not been there as a guide :)
Mar 23 22:34:54 <crose>	Nickwiz: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/8000
Mar 23 22:35:38 <nickspoon>	hahuang65: yeah that command has been created without the  `-bar`  argument
Mar 23 22:35:47 <nickspoon>	So it doesn't allow other commands to follow it
Mar 23 22:35:53 <nickspoon>	:h :command-bar
Mar 23 22:35:53 <digmbot>	:help :command-bar -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/map.txt.html#%3Acommand-bar
Mar 23 22:36:23 <nickspoon>	(I assume we're talking about this command: https://github.com/rcarriga/vim-ultest/blob/master/plugin/ultest.vim#L230 )
Mar 23 22:37:12 <nickspoon>	crose++
Mar 23 22:37:58 <hahuang65>	nickspoon maybe I'm misunderstanding the bar... is there anyway I can just map a keybind to two consecutive commands?
Mar 23 22:39:01 <nickspoon>	The easiest is probably to skip the command, and just call the functions that the commands call?
Mar 23 22:39:26 <nickspoon>	Or at least do that for the first one
Mar 23 22:40:05 <nickspoon>	Maybe:  nnoremap <leader>tl :call ultest#run_file() <bar> UltestSummaryOpen<CR>
Mar 23 22:40:09 <nickspoon>	(untested)
Mar 23 22:44:35 <hahuang65>	oh
Mar 23 22:44:38 <hahuang65>	i can try that
Mar 23 22:44:39 <hahuang65>	thanks
Mar 23 22:54:26 <hahuang65>	nickspoon yeah that works fantastically
Mar 23 22:54:27 <hahuang65>	thank you
Mar 23 22:58:44 <nickspoon>	no worries
Mar 23 23:08:35 <Brutus>	maybe someone here has an idea how to do this. I want to be able to visually select something, then have a result like this: something\index{something} . So I do ctrl+v, then leader<key> and end up with that.
Mar 23 23:09:05 <Brutus>	so i go to the text, do ctrl+v, select the word something, do leader<key> and end up with that something\index{something}.
Mar 23 23:11:02 <nickspoon>	Why ctrl-v instead of just v ?
Mar 23 23:11:30 <Brutus>	sure, just v is fine
Mar 23 23:12:33 <spacetato>	Brutus: like if you had selected `abc` you want literally: `abc\index{abc}`?
Mar 23 23:12:39 <Brutus>	yeah
Mar 23 23:14:47 <nickspoon>	xnoremap <leader>cp c^R"\index{^R"}   <- that's one way, where ^R is a control character entered by hitting ctrl+v ctrl+r
Mar 23 23:16:41 <nickspoon>	xnoremap <leader>cp c<C-r>"\index{<C-r>"}   <- that's an easier way to write it, no control characters
Mar 23 23:16:56 <Brutus>	ok i'll start with the second one, one moment
Mar 23 23:17:47 <Brutus>	it works!!!!
Mar 23 23:17:53 <Brutus>	oh this is going to save me hours of time, thank you :)
Mar 23 23:18:17 <nickspoon>	no worries
Mar 23 23:18:53 <Brutus>	Now I only have a few thousand pages to go through and add the index :)
Mar 23 23:21:07 <nickspoon>	Macro?
Mar 23 23:21:17 <Nickwiz>	crose: Hmm, yes, looks like some work has to be done :0,
Mar 23 23:21:31 <nickspoon>	Actually the other way to do this would be a substitute, might make more sense if there
Mar 23 23:21:37 <Brutus>	Nickwiz: macro?
Mar 23 23:21:45 <nickspoon>	- if there's a recognisable pattern
Mar 23 23:21:48 <Brutus>	no
Mar 23 23:23:08 <Brutus>	it's all in text. for example, I want RS232 to be indexed at the end of the document, so I find all instances of RS232 throughout the document (now ok i could macro that part) and index them. but that's one example, there will be hundreds of em
Mar 23 23:23:33 <Nickwiz>	You should get a cake for that issue number :P. Customer number 8000!
Mar 23 23:40:05 <nickspoon>	Brutus: try this:
Mar 23 23:40:10 <nickspoon>	xnoremap <space>y y:let @/ = getreg('"')<CR>cgn<C-r>"\index{<C-r>"}<Esc>
Mar 23 23:40:28 <nickspoon>	This does the same as the previous version, but it is dot-repeatable
Mar 23 23:41:30 <nickspoon>	so, visually select something, do <space>y (or whatever you map it to) to replace the word under the cursor, then . will find the next usage of the word and perform the replacement on it. Just keep hitting . . . until you wrap to the start.
Mar 23 23:43:30 <nickspoon>	Use n to navigate to instances separately. So if you aren't sure you _always_ want to index something, you can do nnn to skip over a few, hit . on the ones you want to index
Mar 23 23:44:37 <Brutus>	nickspoon: hold on let me try
Mar 23 23:46:37 <Brutus>	dot repeat doesn't work
Mar 23 23:49:20 <nickspoon>	no?
Mar 23 23:49:41 <Brutus>	no
Mar 23 23:50:12 <Brutus>	also, i'm not using it the exact same way. autocmd Filetype tex,latex,plaintex map <leader>lp y:let @/ = getreg('"')<CR>cgn<C-r>"\index{<C-r>"}<Esc>
Mar 23 23:50:35 <Brutus>	copy pasted the line, but used the for me normal way to assign mapping, so it's only available for tex files
Mar 23 23:52:34 <nickspoon>	https://asciinema.org/a/CjZ2NmOMOG9OB8c3mXnBB7UUn
Mar 23 23:53:43 <nickspoon>	If you are using a Filetype autocmd, you should make it a <buffer> mapping. And this is specifically a visual mode mapping so should use xmap. And it should not be recursive, so should use xnoremap
Mar 23 23:54:44 <Brutus>	ok it is working now, and i didn't change anything
Mar 23 23:55:09 <Brutus>	my config files are on my dropbox, that might have given a delay or something
Mar 23 23:55:36 <Brutus>	:q
Mar 23 23:55:42 <nickspoon>	Is your autocmd in an augroup?
Mar 23 23:55:44 <Brutus>	heh wrong window
Mar 23 23:55:50 <Brutus>	i don't know what an augroup is
Mar 23 23:56:30 <nickspoon>	OK. This is what your mapping should look like, in your .vimrc: http://vpaste.net/LdvMS
Mar 23 23:57:12 <nickspoon>	Oops I forgot the <buffer> bit
Mar 23 23:57:17 <Brutus>	no i don't have that
Mar 23 23:57:29 <nickspoon>	http://vpaste.net/nJa2u
Mar 23 23:57:41 <Brutus>	https://termbin.com/10mq
Mar 23 23:57:44 <Brutus>	that's my latex mappings file
Mar 23 23:58:19 <nickspoon>	OK. You need to wrap that entire thing in an augroup, with   `autocmd!` as the first line
Mar 23 23:58:30 <nickspoon>	Then make each of those a <buffer> mapping
Mar 23 23:58:53 <nickspoon>	Otherwise they are global and apply to all buffers/filetypes, but are only _created_ when you enter a tex buffer
Mar 23 23:59:21 <nickspoon>	They should definitely also be `noremap` mappings, not `map`
Mar 24 00:00:23 <nickspoon>	Otherwise they will be recursive, and that can pop up and surprise you at unexpected moments. Rule of thumb is _always_ use non-recursive mappings, unless you have a reason not to. The only reason I've come across is using <Plug> mappings, and there are none here
Mar 24 00:00:59 <Brutus>	ah ok
Mar 24 00:01:13 <SvenG>	recursive -> mandelbrot.vi
Mar 24 00:01:14 <nickspoon>	And when you can, limit the mappings to the mode they will be used in. nnoremap for mappings which are only used in normal mode. xnoremap for mappings which are only used in visual mode. inoremap for insert mode
Mar 24 00:01:20 <Brutus>	and no for normal
Mar 24 00:01:25 <nickspoon>	nno
Mar 24 00:01:43 <nickspoon>	nnoremap, inoremap, vnoremap
Mar 24 00:01:45 <Brutus>	no is for visual too
Mar 24 00:01:57 <Brutus>	sorry sometimes my irc client repeats what is aid
Mar 24 00:02:21 <Brutus>	in this case, i would want it in both visual and normal mode
Mar 24 00:02:41 <Brutus>	isn't noremap (one n) the right choice then?
Mar 24 00:02:54 <nickspoon>	yes

Mar 24 09:14:21 <frojnd>	Hi there... hm how do I enable tabs? like I added `fix_redish_display.patch` line like this: https://imgur.com/a/7h3A3XD and I pressted tab on my keyboard but It didn't tab?
Mar 24 09:15:02 <frojnd>	I think vim is currently seeing tabs but I don't have configured it as tabs?
Mar 24 09:37:58 <habamax>	frojnd: you want to insert tab when you press tab?
Mar 24 09:38:03 <habamax>	:set noet
Mar 24 09:38:27 <habamax>	to check who set this settings try :verbose set expandtab?
Mar 24 09:39:43 <frojnd>	Thank you how can I make this permanent? I have `set expandtab` in vimrc
Mar 24 09:40:23 <habamax>	you can make it default -- add to vimrc `set noexpandtab`
Mar 24 09:40:29 <habamax>	instead of expandtab
Mar 24 09:40:42 <habamax>	but each filetype can override it
Mar 24 09:40:58 <habamax>	python for example do set noexpandtab
Mar 24 09:52:52 <frojnd>	Better learn that command or add it to vimrc notes then
Mar 24 10:03:19 <Tokoyami>	or overwrite it in an after/ftplugin/<filetype>.vim file
Mar 24 10:06:30 <sqz>	hi everyone, I have good news..in the last years I succesfully survived a vim-midlife-crisis: had collected an overcomplex vim-setup over the years..installed vscode..and then I decided to flush .vim-folder and start with a clean slate...it's refreshing how little vim-plugins one needs :)
Mar 24 10:08:07 <sqz>	the temporary vscode-retreat was OK...not amazing though
Mar 24 10:11:39 <ysch>	sqz: Just curious, did you learn vscode at depth? If so, how does it compare to vim (can't find any good comparisons on-line)?
Mar 24 10:21:29 <HaJones>	When using netrw I get an error "<SNR>23_NetrwGetWord:line   26:E21: Cannot make changes, 'modifiable' is off" what to do?
Mar 24 10:21:49 <sqz>	ysch: I didn't learn it at depth. I think it's great, but is hard to compare (as both use plugin ecosystems). VSCode is more friendly for newcomers I suppose. It'll suggest plugins automatically based on files you open..which is nice at first..but leads to a behemoth setup pretty quickly.
Mar 24 10:23:24 <ysch>	sqz: Got it... Thanks!
Mar 24 10:24:46 <sqz>	ysch: I work a lot on different machines using ssh, which run vim out of the box on the commandline..so vscode can't really help me there. What I do like is that VSCode tries to be very vim-compatible, so it's a nice gui for VIM in a way.
Mar 24 10:26:50 <ysch>	sqz: Well, for that purpose, perhaps... I suspect it's rather nice GUI for (crippled) *vi*, though. ;)
Mar 24 10:52:00 <sqz>	true that :)
Mar 24 10:54:14 <sqz>	vi has the unique ability to make me angry
Mar 24 10:54:30 <sqz>	especially when I don't realize I'm in vi instead of vim

Mar 24 12:58:07 <HaJones>	to make vim go down 2 rows when giving the "2o" command, vim only goes down one row and then when I press esc it goes down a second. How do I make vim go down two rows at once?
Mar 24 12:59:34 <sunshavi>	2j
Mar 24 13:11:23 <habamax>	HaJones: 2o does smth different
Mar 24 13:11:33 <habamax>	try 2ohelloworld<esc>
Mar 24 13:12:07 <habamax>	or 100ohundredlines!<esc>
Mar 24 14:28:56 <HaJones>	habamax, Yes I notice now. To make an empty row between text, i.e. 2 blank rows downward, how would you do it?
Mar 24 14:30:23 <habamax>	Do you mean o<CR><ESC>?
Mar 24 14:30:51 <habamax>	create 2 empty rows or smth else?
Mar 24 14:31:20 <HaJones>	yes that would be it.
Mar 24 14:31:49 <lericson>	o<esc>.
Mar 24 14:32:17 <lericson>	2o<esc>
Mar 24 14:32:31 <lericson>	got any more? :D
Mar 24 14:33:27 <lericson>	i guess o<esc>YP but that's like four keystrokes so
Mar 24 14:33:27 <habamax>	2o was in the "shortlist"
Mar 24 14:34:15 <lericson>	advantage of o<esc>. is you can repeat the dot at leisure
Mar 24 14:34:21 <habamax>	it was actually in the question of HaJones
Mar 24 14:35:11 <lericson>	oh

Mar 24 19:09:30 <gehn>	anyone here use ALE and can help explain what is and how to use `cc` for C++?
Mar 24 19:09:59 <gehn>	clang, gcc, g++ and clang++ all apparently "alias" to `cc` as the linter, but the help docs have virtually zero explanation of what cc is, how it works, how to use it or configure it etc
Mar 24 19:12:22 <gehn>	like https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md doesn't list `cc` under either C or C++
Mar 24 19:13:21 <gehn>	also, so far I haven't seemed to be able to actually affect or change the linter aliases, like I can set g:ale_linter_aliases = {} and ALE still reports that clang is aliased to cc
Mar 24 19:14:38 <dementorr>	Hello! Can I have multiple commands in an autocmd? I have: ` autocmd BufWritePost <buffer> :call plugin#function()<bar> echomsg "hello" ` Without the bar part it works, but when put together it doesn't...
Mar 24 19:15:03 <gehn>	dementorr, write a custom function that calls multiple commands and call your custom function
Mar 24 19:15:20 <romainl>	<bar> is useless in this context
Mar 24 19:15:23 <dementorr>	gehn: Okay, I'll try it now
Mar 24 19:15:24 <gehn>	dementorr, also by <bar> do you mean |?
Mar 24 19:15:27 <dementorr>	yes
Mar 24 19:15:33 <gehn>	you can just type |
Mar 24 19:15:44 <gehn>	vim has no special notation for | like it does for e.g. <CR> or <ESC> etc
Mar 24 19:25:31 <dementorr>	Thanks it worked! Now, is there a way to navigate to the quickfix window if there is at least 1 element there?  (Either vanilla or vim-qf)?
Mar 24 19:26:03 <romainl>	:help :cwindow
Mar 24 19:26:03 <digmbot>	:help :cwindow -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/quickfix.txt.html#%3Acwindow
Mar 24 19:26:51 <romainl>	dementorr: what is your goal, exactly?
Mar 24 19:28:24 <dementorr>	romainl: So I am populating the quickfix on save and I want to navigate to it if I should fix something. The thing is that right now the quickfix is on screen, but I have to type C-w C-w to navigate to it after I saved the file
Mar 24 19:29:41 <romainl>	so… do it as part of your autocmd from earlier
Mar 24 19:30:29 <dementorr>	I am trying, but even when I am in the main window, pressing :cwindow will not move me to the quickfix window, I still have to C-w C-w
Mar 24 19:30:32 <romainl>	you can "chain" 3, 6, 10 commands
Mar 24 19:30:49 <romainl>	then do <C-w><C-w>
Mar 24 19:31:30 <dementorr>	I don't think that would scale :)  If there are multiple windows, wouldn't it navigate to the next window instead of the quickfix?
Mar 24 19:31:32 <romainl>	(rest of your autocommand)|wincmd w
Mar 24 19:31:53 <romainl>	you asked for that, specifically
Mar 24 19:33:01 <romainl>	vim-qf has a mapping for that, look it up and adapt it to your needs
Mar 24 19:35:22 <dementorr>	Oh... It seams that cwindow will jump to the quickfix window if it's not visibile. If it is, it wont jump. Ill look into vim-qf
Mar 24 19:48:29 <dementorr>	Okay the function was copen, not cwindow. Now I have a kinda stupid question, but how can I call it? Inside the function, the last command I typed is: ` call copen() ` but it says: "E117: Unknown function: copen"
Mar 24 19:49:16 <dementorr>	If I write it inside the main window (as `:copen ` ) it works
Mar 24 19:55:33 <osse>	dementorr: commands != functions
Mar 24 19:55:47 <osse>	you can :w to write the file, but you can't :call w()
Mar 24 19:57:28 <osse>	the body of a function is just a series of commands. :call is a command, so is :let
Mar 24 20:05:14 <dementorr>	osse: Okay so this is my code now: https://pastebin.com/hXkvB5b5 . I think there may be a problem that this is invoked as ` autocmd BufWritePost `. If I use it directly ( :RunFlake8 ) it jumps but when I save the file it wont automatically jump and I have to use C-w C-w
Mar 24 20:08:01 <romainl>	dementorr: that code is silly
Mar 24 20:09:41 <romainl>	all the functionality you want is already built in that flake8 plugin
Mar 24 20:11:53 <dementorr>	romainl: I know that is builtin, but I prefer to have the quickfix window resized... So for me it makes sense... But am I right in that the command ` :copen ` won't work when used for a ` BufWritePost ` ?
Mar 24 20:12:21 <romainl>	:copen sucks, use :cwindow instead
Mar 24 20:13:00 <dementorr>	:cwindow does not jump if the window is visible, :copen will jump
Mar 24 20:13:54 <romainl>	again, that flake8 plugin already handles that
Mar 24 20:14:12 <romainl>	just set the proper options
Mar 24 20:15:15 <dementorr>	If I have 1 error, flake8 will display a 10 row with 1 row full 9 empty, your plugin will display only 1 row. I would like to have that option, but with flake8 I can only select a fix number of rows...
Mar 24 20:15:54 <romainl>	so just let vim-qf handle that, as it does by default
Mar 24 20:17:34 <romainl>	I'm probably missing something
Mar 24 20:17:54 <dementorr>	I'll try putting ` call qf#OpenQuickfix() ` in an ` autocmd BufWritePost ` to see if it will jump
Mar 24 20:21:03 <romainl>	why don't you just call flake8#flake8()?
Mar 24 20:21:58 <romainl>	BTW, that way of exposing your plugin's gust is disgusting
Mar 24 20:21:59 <dementorr>	If I have 1 error, flake8 will display 10 rows with 1 row full 9 empty
Mar 24 20:22:15 <romainl>	and vim-qf will resize the window
Mar 24 20:23:24 <Led_Zeppelin>	i have a very long file which uses parenthesis. Is there a way to quickly validate if all the parenthesis match ? {} ?
Mar 24 20:23:38 <dementorr>	It wont as far as I can see...
Mar 24 20:24:30 *	s3nd1v0g1us is now known as patr0clus
Mar 24 20:24:34 <romainl>	Led_Zeppelin: other than putting your cursor on one { and doing % no
Mar 24 20:24:49 <Led_Zeppelin>	hah. I see
Mar 24 20:25:14 <Led_Zeppelin>	thats actually a very clever!
Mar 24 20:25:38 <romainl>	dementorr: as mentioned in vim-qf's README, it is incompatible with all the plugins that manipulate the quickfix window
Mar 24 20:26:08 <dementorr>	Apart from the the jump part it works as fine as I can see :-)
Mar 24 20:26:24 <romainl>	then it doesn't work
Mar 24 20:26:44 <dementorr>	If I can't make it on :w I will bind a <leader>sth to use the linter
Mar 24 20:26:57 <romainl>	https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8/blob/master/autoload/flake8.vim#L154 is probably why
Mar 24 20:28:46 <romainl>	OK, back to The Gordin Cell S01E04 dementorr, if you have trouble with vim-qf, use its issue tracker
Mar 24 20:30:49 <dementorr>	Okay, I'll look more into it. It may be a vim limitation (not being able to run commands from BufWritePost. But thanks for your help :D
Mar 24 20:36:50 <dementorr>	romainl: Okay, so it's a vim limitation: I have tried searching for a fixed tag (A) that exists, and when using :RunTest it will jump, but from a BufWritePost it will just open it and it won't jump. Link: https://pastebin.com/tCAZUhiX

Apr 01 21:05:00 <marslander>	so why didn't it work
Apr 01 21:05:03 <zeraphel>	marslander: the paste clearly says its the huge version without the gui (and no clipboard), either you're launching the wrong thing or installed the wrong thing
Apr 01 21:05:33 <romainl>	in some systems, the executable is the same for gvim and vim, in some other systems you have two executables
Apr 01 21:05:53 <marslander>	I'm not using gvim because it's not required. Luke did it without accessing  gvim
Apr 01 21:06:15 <romainl>	he is not using the same system as you
Apr 01 21:06:26 <marslander>	correct :(
Apr 01 21:06:32 <zeraphel>	for the record, its not too difficult to compile vim from source with the clipboard support
Apr 01 21:06:32 <romainl>	in your case, don't use vim, use gvim -v
Apr 01 21:08:49 <romainl>	Also, learn Vim in Vim, not with stupid youtube videos: :h user-manual
Apr 01 21:08:50 <digmbot>	:help user-manual -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/usr_toc.txt.html#user-manual
Apr 01 21:10:18 <marslander>	romainl: that works thanks, but isn't it cheating?
Apr 01 21:10:26 <romainl>	no
Apr 01 21:10:56 <marslander>	gvim uses my .vimrc so that's really cool
Apr 01 21:10:59 <romainl>	it's solving a problem simply and getting back to work
Apr 01 21:11:34 <romainl>	vim is gvim -v and gvim is vim -g
Apr 01 21:12:20 <marslander>	:O
Apr 01 21:12:24 <marslander>	genius
Apr 01 21:32:47 <zeraphel>	is there a sane way to close either the quickfix or location lists? Wanted to make a filetype mapping in ftplugin/qf.vim... Or How would i distinguish between the two?
Apr 01 21:33:00 <zeraphel>	.. or how sould i distinguish between the two*
Apr 01 21:33:31 <lopid>	cclose, lclose
Apr 01 21:33:52 <zeraphel>	yes but one of those would throw an error, and silent! on both just seems messy =S
Apr 01 21:33:54 <zeraphel>	currently using nnoremap <buffer> <f3> <cmd> let w = winnr() \| wincmd p \| exe w .. 'close' \| unlet w <cr>
Apr 01 21:34:00 <romainl>	see vim-qf for how to differentiate
Apr 01 21:34:14 <romainl>	but that's a bad idea
Apr 01 21:35:15 <romainl>	if you have one quickfix window and n location windows, what would be the expected outcome?
Apr 01 21:37:29 <zeraphel>	per current setup, i'd expect the currently current window to close. reason I'm not using ccl / lcl outright is to get the cursor back into where the quickfix was called from
Apr 01 21:37:42 <zeraphel>	and neat, one of your plugins. will be looking into it
Apr 01 21:38:06 <romainl>	you can close the current window with :q
Apr 01 21:39:00 <zeraphel>	hyep, but that'd just leave me in a random window
Apr 01 21:39:38 <romainl>	in the previous window, no?
Apr 01 21:40:44 <zeraphel>	nope, last in line.. perhaps due to having set splitbelow & splitright, perhaps not
Apr 01 21:41:38 <romainl>	correct
Apr 01 21:41:51 <Speedhog>	The in-editor user manual tip is neat!
Apr 01 21:42:02 <romainl>	true
Apr 01 21:54:53 <zeraphel>	ah ofcourse, the swiss knife `getwininfo(win_getid())`
Apr 01 21:54:58 <zeraphel>	thanks!

Apr 16 20:35:40 <Speedhog>	There's something unfortunate that happened
Apr 16 20:36:37 <romainl>	Yeah, I felt that disturbance in the Force, too
Apr 16 20:36:37 <Speedhog>	A friend is a very avid VSC user, so he was showing me around using a live share functionality, I had the vim keybindings plugin installed naturally
Apr 16 20:36:51 <Speedhog>	But said plugin was faulty
Apr 16 20:36:57 <Speedhog>	So that plugin started flipping out in live share, wrecking his code
Apr 16 20:37:16 <romainl>	"live share"?
Apr 16 20:37:16 <Speedhog>	Now he thinks that plugin was Vim and refuses to try to learn Vim
Apr 16 20:37:29 <Speedhog>	romainl: lol @ the previous message
Apr 16 20:37:43 <romainl>	how is that important if he doesn't want to learn Vim?
Apr 16 20:38:27 <Speedhog>	He did want to before
Apr 16 20:38:37 <romainl>	people change their mind, no big deal
Apr 16 20:38:37 <Speedhog>	True
Apr 16 20:39:20 <Speedhog>	Just sharing that tiny mishap
Apr 16 20:39:20 <romainl>	if Vim plugins can fuck up your code then that reflects badly on Vim itself and the quality of its ecosystem
Apr 16 20:39:40 <Speedhog>	The thing is, that was a Vim-like keybindings plugin
Apr 16 20:39:46 <Speedhog>	Not actual vim in itself
Apr 16 20:39:50 <romainl>	ho
Apr 16 20:40:08 <romainl>	vscodevim or something?
Apr 16 20:40:09 <Speedhog>	Yup, I think so
Apr 16 20:40:20 <Speedhog>	It flips out in Live share
Apr 16 20:40:35 <Speedhog>	Sending your last command over and over
Apr 16 20:40:56 <romainl>	Vim emulators are not Vim. Tell your friend that even Vimmers think it's crap
Apr 16 20:41:10 <Speedhog>	Exactly, hahah

Apr 30 13:37:27 <cek>	this software is a peice of crap
Apr 30 13:37:29 <LeoNerd>	set sw=4   ?
Apr 30 13:37:35 <habamax>	you don't do autoformatting with =
Apr 30 13:37:48 <LeoNerd>	sw short for "shiftwidth", the width by which to shift for one level of indentation
Apr 30 13:37:49 <cek>	what is this sw cryptic option
Apr 30 13:37:55 <cek>	how am I even supposed to remember all that?
Apr 30 13:37:58 <LeoNerd>	A shorter way to type  set shiftwidth=4

Apr 30 16:45:02 <zebrag>	[noob] I'm editing my debian source-list. I've copied the "sid" line with `:2t2`. Then edit mode, I inserted newlines. Now I want, in edit mode, to backspace "sid" and replace it by "experimental". I don't want to type all the characters of "experimental", I want Vim to help me with some autocomplete. The word "experimental" is occurring somewhere else in the file I'm editing.
Apr 30 16:46:12 <zebrag>	Even if I was typing `:4s/sid/experimental/` I'd like some help from vim to type "experimental" which is quite a long word to type.
Apr 30 16:46:40 <zebrag>	Auto completion can also help avoid some typos.
Apr 30 17:03:19 <habamax>	C-p
Apr 30 17:03:26 <habamax>	or C-n
Apr 30 17:03:56 <habamax>	if noob, have a chance reading :h user-manual

Apr 30 17:04:09 <habamax>	and before that vimtutor
Apr 30 17:04:57 <habamax>	why would you copy with an ex command though?
Apr 30 17:05:17 <habamax>	it is just a matter of yyp
Apr 30 17:06:01 <habamax>	then do not "backspace" sid, but just get over it and press cw or ciw
Apr 30 17:06:11 <habamax>	start typing exp<C-p>
Apr 30 17:06:58 <habamax>	all in all, user-manual is highly recommended (although vast majority ignores this recommendation)
Apr 30 17:08:07 <mohab>	I'm trying to add the YouCompleteMe plugin with Pathogen, but I keep getting the following error: 'YouCompleteMe unavailable: No module named ycmd'
Apr 30 17:08:38 <habamax>	specifically for you case this is :h 24.3, zebrag. Aaand you are gone ofc
Apr 30 17:08:51 <mohab>	I am on Arch, and I tried to follow the upstream manual for Linux, but neither Arch nor Pathogen are mentioned, so I'm not sure if I did anything wrong.
Apr 30 17:09:01 <habamax>	mohab, interesting what is in plugin readme?
Apr 30 17:09:22 <zebrag>	habamax: sorry, had to reboot ;)

Apr 30 17:11:59 <zebrag>	Thanks a lot, very nice
Apr 30 18:04:14 <goulix>	Is it just me or is the default vim spelling dict missing a lot of words
Apr 30 18:04:16 <goulix>	uncool

Apr 30 18:30:33 <haijuno>	Thanks
Apr 30 18:38:21 <habamax>	But I would just use :w or :up
Apr 30 18:39:52 <goulix>	:w has as many keystrokes as ZZ
Apr 30 18:40:01 <goulix>	or 1 less i guess
Apr 30 18:40:05 <goulix>	not a big difference
Apr 30 18:40:08 <habamax>	ZZ quits
Apr 30 18:49:41 <dayid>	ZZ is more like :x :q
Apr 30 18:50:16 <dayid>	since ZZ won't write to disk unless there's a modified buffer.
Apr 30 18:50:18 <wwalker>	Can someone explain to me how \( and \%( are different? I've read through :he regexp mutliple times and I still don't get the difference
Apr 30 18:50:18 <digmbot>	:help regexp -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/pattern.txt.html#regexp
Apr 30 18:50:47 <dayid>	I like that habit a lot better than the :wq habit a lot of people have, since then - sysadmins who "look at" a file using vim (instead of view) often update the "last updated" filesystem dates even when they didn't change anything.
Apr 30 18:50:57 <dayid>	Can be troublesome when debugging "what changed" when stuff ends up broken :/
Apr 30 18:54:56 <novasenco>	wwalker, tl;dr \( captures (can match with \1, \2, etc or submatch(1), submatch(2) in /\=) while \%( doesn't capture and is said to be faster by Savitar, the God of Speed.
Apr 30 18:57:04 <novasenco>	I don't like vim saving files not visible in buffers. I have <m-w> bound to :update and <localleader>q bound to :qa. Mapping an ex command to a key preserves your ex history too. Eg, when I press <m-w>, I don't ever see :silent update in my history
Apr 30 18:57:24 <novasenco>	s/\%(not visible in \)\@<=buffers/windows/
