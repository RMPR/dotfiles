Oct 13 19:28:33 <RMPR>	Hello, may I ask why the aerc development has been removed from github ?
Oct 13 19:29:37 <ddevault>	aerc is an email client and promotes an email-driven development workflow
Oct 13 19:29:41 <ddevault>	sourcehut is better suited to that than github
Oct 13 19:29:47 <ddevault>	and, full disclosure, I am the founder of sourcehut
Oct 13 19:32:49 <RMPR>	I see :p
Oct 13 19:33:07 <RMPR>	I wanted to submit some minor changes that I think would benefit aerc
Oct 13 19:33:26 <ddevault>	https://git-send-email.io has a tutorial, if you're unfamiliar with the workflow
Oct 13 19:34:05 <RMPR>	Thanks, hopefully see you on the mailing list.

Feb 29 14:49:25 <bookworm>	jeffas: what's the use for the pinning? Not against it but I fail to see the use case
Feb 29 14:50:12 <bookworm>	the only thing I don't like is the duplication of pin and pin-tab
Feb 29 14:50:16 <bookworm>	isn't one name enough?
Feb 29 14:50:23 <bookworm>	pin-tab seems better to me
Feb 29 14:59:23 <bookworm>	unpinning should probably move the tab to the right again, normally on the left there's supposed to be the msglist. So if you suddenly have a normal mail there that's kinda strange. Or do you have a different view on the matter?
Feb 29 16:00:53 <jeffas>	bookworm: I was implementing the pinning since there was the todo https://todo.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc2/230. I think it could be useful if someone wanted to pin a terminal tab or something else. Yep, the v2 removed the extra aliases so now it is just the *-tab ones. Unpinning currently moves the tab to the right of the pinned ones but I can see how that is strange since the msglist ones aen't pinned. Would it make sense to have
Feb 29 16:00:53 <jeffas>	the order be something like msglists | pinned | others. Then pinning an other moves it to pinned but pinning a msglist keeps it where it is but shortens the name?
Feb 29 16:03:07 <bookworm>	not sure that shortening the name is something I'd do, not if there's room
Feb 29 16:03:32 <bookworm>	will be hard to differentiate if you have tabs c and c
Feb 29 16:03:59 <bookworm>	I see spec from Drew. Fair enough
Feb 29 16:04:46 <bookworm>	yes, your suggestion to keep the msglists to the left sounds good to me, but maybe ask Drew what he wants
Feb 29 16:05:59 <jeffas>	Yeah, it would be difficult to differentiate them. Is there some way we could mark the tab as pinned if we don't shorten the name? Maybe adding a '-' at the start of the tab?
Feb 29 16:06:32 <bookworm>	I'd use a * but that's bikeshedding
Feb 29 16:06:49 <bookworm>	I'd prefer that but it's not my call
Feb 29 16:07:12 <bookworm>	(that being some different marking instead of shortening to a single char)
Feb 29 16:11:31 <ddevault>	the reason tabstrip and tabcontent are separate pieces is so that they can be put in separate places
Feb 29 16:18:24 <jeffas>	Sure but I think that the tabs should encapsulate both pieces and can sort out their arrangement itself. The patch still gives the flexibility to have the pieces in different arrangements if we add that later, it just simplifies things without having parent pointers and such.
Feb 29 16:19:11 <ddevault>	no, the whole idea of this design is to let the parent sort out the arrangement
Feb 29 16:19:15 <ddevault>	I don't really like this tbh
Feb 29 16:27:41 <jeffas>	No worries

Feb 29 19:16:13 <ddevault>	jeffas: can you rework pinned tabs to work without the other refactoring
Feb 29 19:17:25 <jeffas>	Sure, what are your thoughts on the above? (should pinned tabs go to the left of accountview tabs regardless and is just the first character sufficient or should there be some other identifier?)
Feb 29 19:18:17 <ddevault>	let's remember where it was before being pinned, and move it back there when unpinned
Feb 29 19:18:22 <ddevault>	and keep them to the left
Feb 29 19:18:28 <ddevault>	let's also add a command to move tabs around arbitrarily
Feb 29 19:18:43 <ddevault>	as for the title, let's give it a single configurable character
Feb 29 19:18:55 <ddevault>	I'd recommend ` by default, cause it looks like a pin
