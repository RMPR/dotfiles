Nov 07 19:49:27 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: Your bug with modifiers are comming from winit, I guess, since on key release you're setting `lctrl` state to `false`(it's correct), but glutin mods says it's `true`.
Nov 07 19:51:07 <kchibisov>	On press glutin ctrl is set to false though
Nov 07 20:18:19 <kchibisov>	btw https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1262 fixes this bug on X11.
Nov 07 20:54:29 <kchibisov>	And on Wayland we need ModifiersChanged event, since on ctrl release, glutin's ctrl modifier is still `true`.

Jan 02 13:53:48 <alex``>	how to override settings via cli?
Jan 02 13:54:07 <alex``>	I want to set the background opacity
Jan 02 13:54:11 <UndeadLeech>	alex``: You cannot override all configuration options via cli.
Jan 02 13:54:22 <alex``>	:(
Jan 02 13:54:35 <kchibisov>	If UndeadLeech is fine with me adding flag for opacity I can send a PR
Jan 02 13:54:38 <kchibisov>	since I also need it.
Jan 02 13:54:39 <UndeadLeech>	It's been discussed before, but it's not really high priority enough.
Jan 02 13:54:46 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: I don't think I am.
Jan 02 13:55:02 <kchibisov>	Ofc, because you don't use it.
Jan 02 13:55:04 <alex``>	currently I have a horrible hack to use a temporary file
Jan 02 13:55:05 <UndeadLeech>	If we change this, I'd like a way to just set all configuration options.
Jan 02 13:55:07 *	kchibisov is joking
Jan 02 13:55:11 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Jan 02 13:55:39 <UndeadLeech>	The problem is just that I'm not aware of any nice way to implement this, but I haven't looked much into it yet.
Jan 02 13:55:46 <alex``>	https://gist.github.com/f3e7e12c7357737cdb3234637bf5f422
Jan 02 13:56:02 <alex``>	horrible horrible :(
Jan 02 13:56:10 <UndeadLeech>	Would want something like `alacritty --option scrolling.history 100000 --option background_opacity 0`.
Jan 02 13:56:10 <kchibisov>	alex``: you can patch your alacritty tbh, it's not that hard.
Jan 02 13:56:23 <alex``>	how?
Jan 02 13:56:45 <kchibisov>	I mean you can add a flag to alacritty yourself, it's not that hard tbh.
Jan 02 13:56:57 <alex``>	ah
Jan 02 13:57:02 <alex``>	UndeadLeech: yes
Jan 02 14:00:22 <kchibisov>	Oh, I have an odd idea. Could you build a valid yaml from this thing UndeadLeech ?
Jan 02 14:01:03 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think `key.key.key` is valid in yaml.
Jan 02 14:01:03 <kchibisov>	not exactly yaml, but translate such option to our config and then merge configs.
Jan 02 14:01:45 <UndeadLeech>	It's a good idea, though we might have to build a tool ourselves to convert it.
Jan 02 14:02:11 <kchibisov>	I mean we should have a way to write it once and not touch afterwards. Like you shouldn't tune it each time you add new option to config.
Jan 02 14:02:37 <UndeadLeech>	Yes, exactly. Everything else wouldn't be acceptable.
Jan 02 14:03:30 <alex``>	jq have a similar syntax
Jan 02 14:03:35 <alex``>	has*
Jan 02 14:03:35 <kchibisov>	maybe we can use `scrolling.history: 10000` and then just translate dots into new lines
Jan 02 14:03:53 <UndeadLeech>	Newlines and indentation! Careful there. :D
Jan 02 14:03:54 <kchibisov>	I mean colon + new line.
Jan 02 14:04:07 <kchibisov>	and indention...
Jan 02 14:04:33 <UndeadLeech>	I mean at that point we might as well have it as separate parameters too.
Jan 02 14:04:40 <UndeadLeech>	I think that would be the unix way.
Jan 02 14:04:47 <alex``>	https://github.com/alexherbo2/krabby/commit/d625bb662901560e311c8a3227d1ce13ed7fb92f#diff-171b240ba817349df923fe7acebbe72dR5
Jan 02 14:04:48 <kchibisov>	unix way...
Jan 02 14:04:58 <UndeadLeech>	If we need to transform it anyways, it doesn't really make things much more complicated.
Jan 02 14:05:00 <alex``>	> jq '.browser_specific_settings.gecko.id = "krabby@mozilla.org"' manifest.json > target/firefox/manifest.json
Jan 02 14:05:14 <alex``>	pretty convenient syntax
Jan 02 14:05:45 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, I didn't come up with this. Neither did `jq`. It's a pretty common format and I believe other terminals work similarly.
Jan 02 14:06:29 <alex``>	is jwilm still on the project?
Jan 02 14:06:56 <UndeadLeech>	Currently he's busy with other things unrelated to Alacritty.
Jan 02 14:06:57 <alex``>	it looks he have abandonned the development Alacritty
Jan 02 14:07:11 <kchibisov>	Well our development is quite active as you can see.

Jan 02 17:24:06 <Levanx>	(This pretty clearly should be the repo image for alacritty imho :D)
Jan 02 17:24:49 <kchibisov>	Levanx: true, I already tried to convince UndeadLeech to change a picture to something more fun.
Jan 02 17:25:29 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: You're not the first one to say that.
Jan 02 17:25:44 <UndeadLeech>	Though last time it was a big thinking emoji. :P
Jan 02 17:26:09 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: So currently we only scale it, if it has color? In retrospect, that very clearly seems wrong.
Jan 02 17:26:17 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:26:36 <UndeadLeech>	And you're saying it's only possible to make these emojis monochrome in Alacritty? Not in fontconfig?
Jan 02 17:26:52 <UndeadLeech>	Sounds strange.
Jan 02 17:26:59 <kchibisov>	Yeah, I wasn't able to make them monochrome in fontconfig
Jan 02 17:27:28 <UndeadLeech>	Huh.
Jan 02 17:27:38 <kchibisov>	Our handling seems fine tbh.
Jan 02 17:27:39 <UndeadLeech>	Well, proper monochrome emoji fonts are going to look better anyways I suppose.
Jan 02 17:28:05 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean it seems fine? How is color a good way to determine if a glyph needs to be scaled?
Jan 02 17:28:06 <kchibisov>	`let color = pat.color().next().unwrap_or(false);`
Jan 02 17:28:15 <kchibisov>	no, I'm about fontconfig check
Jan 02 17:28:27 <UndeadLeech>	You mean the embedded bitmap crash?
Jan 02 17:28:32 <kchibisov>	No color check
Jan 02 17:28:48 <kchibisov>	I mean I should be able to disable the thing
Jan 02 17:29:04 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, you mean that you should be able to set it from fontconfig, gotcha.
Jan 02 17:29:07 <kchibisov>	it's even default to false.
Jan 02 17:29:59 <kchibisov>	Well we can't strip an alpha channel from this non colored emojis
Jan 02 17:30:13 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Jan 02 17:30:25 <kchibisov>	I mean they do have alpha.
Jan 02 17:30:41 <UndeadLeech>	How is that a problem?
Jan 02 17:31:21 <kchibisov>	I mean do you want to color them with escape or not afterwards?
Jan 02 17:32:00 <UndeadLeech>	Ouh that's a really good question.
Jan 02 17:32:14 <UndeadLeech>	You mean since they come in a BGRA buffer, we'd basically handle them like colored emojis?
Jan 02 17:32:19 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:32:31 <kchibisov>	I mean their pixels are RGBA
Jan 02 17:32:37 <kchibisov>	so it's a colored thing for our renderer
Jan 02 17:32:39 <UndeadLeech>	Does that happen with them right now already?
Jan 02 17:32:47 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:32:53 <UndeadLeech>	I'd just keep it that way, but scale them tbh.
Jan 02 17:33:08 <UndeadLeech>	I doubt anyone would use them, but if they do, we at least don't have them massive.
Jan 02 17:33:13 <kchibisov>	Well, it seems like they're being colored properly tbh
Jan 02 17:33:27 <UndeadLeech>	But BGRA aren't colored, right?
Jan 02 17:33:31 <UndeadLeech>	RGBA*
Jan 02 17:33:39 <UndeadLeech>	We use that to determine color, aren't we?
Jan 02 17:33:45 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:34:03 <kchibisov>	I feel like there's something odd with this thing.
Jan 02 17:34:09 <kchibisov>	like I don't understand it.
Jan 02 17:34:22 <UndeadLeech>	I mean in theory converting to alpha mask should be trivial, but it's work that probably is never going to pay off.
Jan 02 17:34:25 <kchibisov>	we're setting #ffffff color for them, but you can still color it.
Jan 02 17:34:37 <UndeadLeech>	It seems very odd then, yeah.
Jan 02 17:34:46 <UndeadLeech>	With a black background?
Jan 02 17:34:50 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:35:25 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's the only place where we pass color to the renderer. So it should be impossible.
Jan 02 17:35:34 <kchibisov>	magic.
Jan 02 17:35:43 <kchibisov>	wait.
Jan 02 17:35:45 <UndeadLeech>	That's what it sounds like. Unless it's not an RGBA buffer.
Jan 02 17:35:55 *	UndeadLeech waits.
Jan 02 17:40:01 <kchibisov>	It's not BGRA...
Jan 02 17:40:27 <kchibisov>	It's GRAY.
Jan 02 17:42:51 <kchibisov>	Ehm, now it's interesting, we should downscale gray thing.
Jan 02 17:49:46 <kchibisov>	What do you thing about downsampling everything with fixupfactor less then a 1?
Jan 02 17:49:51 <kchibisov>	s/thing/think
Jan 02 19:51:05 <UndeadLeech>	I'd have to check how we compute the fixup factor again. Is that computed at all?
Jan 02 19:51:22 <UndeadLeech>	Will fonts always provide it, even if it's a 'normal' glyph?
Jan 02 21:41:23 <UndeadLeech>	I think I just fixed the last bug of the 0.4.1 milestone, now we wait for winit/glutin.
Jan 02 22:42:34 <cole-h>	🎉

Mar 18 17:20:15 <nixpulvis>	https://crates.io/users/swmon
Mar 18 17:20:18 <nixpulvis>	look at this shit.
Mar 18 17:20:44 <nixpulvis>	9 fucking pages of crates, not 1 LoC as far as I can tell.
Mar 18 17:21:10 <nixpulvis>	sorry 11 pages.
Mar 18 17:22:03 <nixpulvis>	on the *bright* side ;) https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/3423#issuecomment-600726351 looks pretty.

Mar 18 17:36:17 <UndeadLeech>	It should have just made it more robust.

Mar 18 17:39:33 <kchibisov>	it sending char twice, yes
Mar 18 17:39:40 <kchibisov>	but only in Alt screen.
Mar 18 17:40:11 <UndeadLeech>	Huh?
Mar 18 17:41:30 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, I don't think it's alt screen.
Mar 18 17:42:08 <kchibisov>	I'm just saying that outside of neovim it works(1 char), inside it sends 2 chars.
Mar 18 17:43:00 <UndeadLeech>	echo -e "\e[?1h"
Mar 18 17:43:02 <UndeadLeech>	And it'll break.
Mar 18 17:44:04 <kchibisov>	so, it's just any mode besides normal?
Mar 18 17:44:34 <UndeadLeech>	Might be related to this potentially: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/1a8cd172e520e493bacc9c6a2ae6f80de086eaa3#diff-477049f60a4e0056df655eec516628e7R272
Mar 18 17:45:20 <kchibisov>	it was bisected to vi mode already.
Mar 18 17:45:34 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah I know, that doesn't really help though.
Mar 18 17:46:41 <UndeadLeech>	Ah.
Mar 18 17:46:44 <UndeadLeech>	The notmode doesn't match.
Mar 18 17:46:51 <UndeadLeech>	So it doesn't consider them equal.
Mar 18 17:47:56 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure if we can fix that.
Mar 18 17:48:10 <kchibisov>	...

Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Now talking on #alacritty
Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Topic for #alacritty is: Alacritty - A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator <> Latest Release: v0.4.1 - https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases/tag/v0.4.1
Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Topic for #alacritty set by UndeadLeech!~UndeadLee@165.227.76.134 (Sun Feb 16 20:20:48 2020)
Mar 18 22:39:15 <kchibisov>	but if your bold font isn't a bold font it doesn't matter.
Mar 18 22:40:25 <kchibisov>	Also, we don't know if your font is bold or not.
Mar 18 22:40:25 <ubitux>	no but i mean, if the terminal can't show to the user the difference between bold and non-bold because the font doesn't support it, wouldn't it make sense to fallback on using the bright color instead by default (if and only if the font doesn't support it)
Mar 18 22:40:30 <ubitux>	but i'm nitpicking about random default, that setting is fine with me
Mar 18 22:40:32 <kchibisov>	we don't know it.
Mar 18 22:40:43 <ubitux>	ah, alright
Mar 18 22:40:55 <ubitux>	no such meta? that's surprising
Mar 18 22:41:13 <kchibisov>	I mean I can use different regular font as a bold font.
Mar 18 22:41:43 <kchibisov>	even if you have some meta, you can't say for sure.
Mar 18 22:41:50 <ubitux>	ok ok
Mar 18 22:42:10 <kchibisov>	So changing draw_bold_text_as_bright is likely a way to go for most users.
Mar 18 22:42:43 <kchibisov>	If they still want this behavior.
Mar 18 22:42:44 <ubitux>	alright
Mar 18 22:43:05 <kchibisov>	However I'd recommend to use bright colors if you want them.
Mar 18 22:44:00 <ubitux>	yeah i re-enabled that setting
Mar 18 22:44:11 <kchibisov>	I mean in your app.
Mar 18 22:44:19 <ubitux>	ah :)
Mar 18 22:46:45 <ubitux>	ok so, that vi-mode, i typically used it to copy a line in urxvt, right now the workflow equivalent of alt+esc <make select> esc shift+insert seems: ctrl+shift+space <make select> i ctrl+shift+v
Mar 18 22:46:58 <ubitux>	is there a way to have the copy inside the native clipboard?
Mar 18 22:47:12 <ubitux>	so i can use shift+insert instead of ctrl+shift+v?
Mar 18 22:47:27 <ubitux>	(and transfer it elsewhere)
Mar 18 22:48:00 <kchibisov>	shift + insert should work.
Mar 18 22:48:19 <kchibisov>	IIRC we have a binding for it to paste.
Mar 18 22:48:25 <UndeadLeech>	As long as you're not on macOS, yes.
Mar 18 22:49:10 <ubitux>	it's not in the clipboard, so shift+insert doesn't work here
Mar 18 22:49:19 <UndeadLeech>	Where else would it be?
Mar 18 22:49:23 <cole-h>	Man, English is hard
Mar 18 22:49:29 <ubitux>	in some alacritty specific buffer
Mar 18 22:49:31 <kchibisov>	Oh, have you pressed `copy`?
Mar 18 22:49:32 <UndeadLeech>	It really is. Especially shortenglish.
Mar 18 22:49:37 <cole-h>	UndeadLeech: Can we switch our changelog to lojban?
Mar 18 22:49:41 <cole-h>	:D
Mar 18 22:49:41 <ubitux>	kchibisov: "y" yes
Mar 18 22:49:52 <UndeadLeech>	As soon as you yank it, it will be in the system clipboard.
Mar 18 22:50:01 <kchibisov>	so ctrl + shift + v works, but shift + insert - not?
Mar 18 22:50:03 <UndeadLeech>	cole-h: Brainfuck.
Mar 18 22:50:06 <ubitux>	kchibisov: yes
Mar 18 22:50:20 <cole-h>	UndeadLeech: I thought that was just a JS dialect
Mar 18 22:50:22 <cole-h>	Oh no
Mar 18 22:50:30 <ubitux>	kchibisov: if i make a mouse select, shift+insert works though
Mar 18 22:50:36 <UndeadLeech>	ubitux: Could you check your `alacritty --print-events` output? Sounds like your key isn't setting the virtual keycode.
Mar 18 22:50:38 <ubitux>	but not after in yank the vi-mode
Mar 18 22:50:40 <UndeadLeech>	cole-h: That's JSFuck.
Mar 18 22:50:45 <ubitux>	a yank in vi-mode*
Mar 18 22:50:53 <kchibisov>	Oh, shift + insert is from primary buffer?
Mar 18 22:51:12 <kchibisov>	I mean from middle mouse selection.
Mar 18 22:51:17 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Mar 18 22:51:23 <UndeadLeech>	Shift+Insert pastes from selection clipboard.
Mar 18 22:51:27 <kchibisov>	Oh, so you should yank to it.
Mar 18 22:51:29 <UndeadLeech>	You can change that though ubitux.
Mar 18 22:51:41 <ubitux>	yeah?
Mar 18 22:51:42 <kchibisov>	`y` is to a Ctrl + V clipboard.
Mar 18 22:52:03 <UndeadLeech>	Just copy the keybinding and change it to `Paste` instead of `PasteSelection`.
Mar 18 22:52:26 <ubitux>	kchibisov: ah i see, that one works indeed
Mar 18 22:52:43 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, the problem is the pasting, not the copying.
Mar 18 22:52:45 <ubitux>	UndeadLeech: it's not the paste i want to change
Mar 18 22:52:51 <kchibisov>	Hm, UndeadLeech do we need a binding to copy to primary buffer?
Mar 18 22:52:56 <ubitux>	UndeadLeech:  no because i want to middle click somewhere else
Mar 18 22:52:59 <UndeadLeech>	Wait, you actually want it to yank to the selection clipboard?
Mar 18 22:53:05 <ubitux>	yep
Mar 18 22:53:09 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Potentially.
Mar 18 22:53:28 <kchibisov>	ok, we'll add CopyPrimary.
Mar 18 22:53:45 <ubitux>	i mean it's not actually important but it's surprising coming from urxvt
Mar 18 22:53:50 <ubitux>	i sure can adapt :)
Mar 18 22:54:05 <UndeadLeech>	We just follow what vi does when you set it to write to your host clipboard.
Mar 18 22:54:11 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't write to the selection clipboard either.
Mar 18 22:54:21 <ubitux>	im not sure vi is the best example of clipboard copy/paste :')
Mar 18 22:54:37 <ubitux>	freaking nightmare to get copy/paste correct with vim
Mar 18 22:54:42 <kchibisov>	I mean you have a way to copy into primary buffer from vi, we just forgot about it.
Mar 18 22:55:07 <kchibisov>	The problem I see is that you don't have primary buffer on macOS/Windows.
Mar 18 22:55:26 <kchibisov>	And on some Wayland compositors it's not a thing either.

Mar 19 15:32:44 <kchibisov>	So msi installer could only be for the actuall release. We do provide 'portable', they are enough for testing IIRC.
Mar 19 16:21:41 <nixpulvis>	yo, can you tell LLVM to ignore a single instruction for optimization?
Mar 19 16:38:46 <kchibisov>	put it in asm_volatile?
Mar 19 16:39:05 <nixpulvis>	ohhh nice, volatile may make sense
Mar 19 16:39:25 <kchibisov>	you should use assembly though.
Mar 19 16:39:48 <kchibisov>	however you can pass your value to asm_volatile as input, so LLVM won't touch it.
Mar 19 16:40:06 <kchibisov>	like let x = 0; __asm volatile(x);
Mar 19 16:40:27 <kchibisov>	at least it won't optimize it away.
Mar 19 17:38:06 <ubitux>	mmh, alacritty git/master is much much slower in (n)vim here compared to latest release
Mar 19 17:38:09 <ubitux>	is this known?
Mar 19 17:39:44 <ubitux>	my cpu spikes violently when i scroll (jjjjj...)
Mar 19 17:40:15 <ubitux>	i get one core at 100%
Mar 19 17:41:46 <kchibisov>	what's your `alacritty --version`?
Mar 19 17:43:34 <ubitux>	alacritty 0.5.0-dev (3d7a789)
Mar 19 17:44:34 <kchibisov>	Does it spikes in alacritty or vim?
Mar 19 17:45:25 <ubitux>	alacritty
Mar 19 17:45:29 <kchibisov>	I can't repro either in nvim or on benchmarks.
Mar 19 17:45:45 <kchibisov>	Are you sure that you're using release build?
Mar 19 17:45:58 <kchibisov>	on both X11/Wayland I mean.
Mar 19 17:47:47 <ubitux>	it's a debug build (i did a cargo run)
Mar 19 17:48:01 <ubitux>	how can i enable the release one?
Mar 19 17:48:11 <cole-h>	`cargo run --release`
Mar 19 17:49:47 <kchibisov>	Well, I'm not surprised for debug build.
Mar 19 17:50:11 <kchibisov>	I mean for its performance.
Mar 19 17:52:02 <ubitux>	cole-h: thanks, trying that out (damn it's so slow to compile :P)
Mar 19 17:52:28 <cole-h>	Debug builds are for debugging because they're relatively quick to compile
Mar 19 17:52:35 <cole-h>	Release builds are for day-to-day use :P
Mar 19 17:52:48 <kchibisov>	if you want to install your `release` build later, you should do `cargo install --path alacritty --locked --force`.
Mar 19 17:52:54 <ubitux>	it's stuck on the last bin for 3 minutes already
Mar 19 17:52:59 <cole-h>	Yep
Mar 19 17:53:02 <kchibisov>	yeah, LTO.
Mar 19 17:53:19 *	cole-h can't wait until `--locked` becomes unnecessary, because it should be default...
Mar 19 17:53:25 <ubitux>	ah that's much better indeed
Mar 19 17:53:33 <ubitux>	release doesn't have the problem, nice
Mar 19 17:53:43 <ubitux>	sorry for the noise :)
Mar 19 17:53:49 <kchibisov>	does it differ from your old version?
Mar 19 17:54:07 <kchibisov>	for me it's like 2% in alacritty when I scroll in neovim with 60 repeat rate.
Mar 19 17:54:07 <ubitux>	nah, it's pretty much the same
Mar 19 17:54:26 <ubitux>	yeah it's not really noticable, around 5-10%, but that's nvim
Mar 19 17:54:46 <kchibisov>	So old version is about the same here?
Mar 19 17:57:25 <ubitux>	i tried a larger file, it's actually a bit faster in the old version
Mar 19 17:57:33 <ubitux>	like, 24% vs 27% cpu
Mar 19 17:57:48 <ubitux>	but that's fine with me
Mar 19 17:58:02 <kchibisov>	I mean it's hard to judje since rust changes perf most of the time.
Mar 19 17:58:14 <kchibisov>	Like it really depends on compiler sometimes.
Mar 19 17:58:26 <kchibisov>	On benchmarks I don't see any difference.
Mar 19 18:03:49 <kchibisov>	I also wonder why our CPU usage differs so much in nvim.
Mar 19 18:04:10 <kchibisov>	Oh, are you using integrated GPU?
Mar 19 18:05:15 <ubitux>	yes
Mar 19 18:05:45 <kchibisov>	yeah, so for me all of extra percent is on GPU, I think.
Mar 19 18:05:53 <ubitux>	i have enough ptsd with big brand gpu, and i like small machines :p
Mar 19 18:07:40 <kchibisov>	yeah, was just curious. And they ask why terminal needs GPU acceleration :- ).
Mar 19 18:09:00 <kchibisov>	Though for laptops you don't have much options on Linux and the way to go is integrated GPU, since NVIDIA is NVIDIA, and AMD GPU in a laptops is still very rare thing.
Mar 19 18:09:36 <kchibisov>	Dedicated AMD GPU in a laptop, I mean.
Mar 19 18:15:52 <nixpulvis>	My nvidia card is starting to act up, and I'm worried :(
Mar 19 18:16:37 <kchibisov>	take a screw driver and remove it.
Mar 19 18:17:26 <kchibisov>	Anyway it's pretty useless for Linux desktops.
Mar 19 18:17:29 <nixpulvis>	but then how will my computer conntect to my monitors?
Mar 19 18:18:02 <kchibisov>	Don't you have integrated GPU inside of it?
Mar 19 18:18:40 <kchibisov>	unless it's some gaming Windows PC, it should work fine.
Mar 19 18:18:58 *	nixpulvis is a gamer
Mar 19 18:19:05 <nixpulvis>	don't judge me
Mar 19 18:19:31 <nixpulvis>	at least I'm not a bitcoin miner.
Mar 19 18:19:50 <kchibisov>	You can game on Linux just fine most of the time though.
Mar 19 18:19:56 <nixpulvis>	false
Mar 19 18:20:17 <kchibisov>	With AMD GPU it should work just fnie.
Mar 19 18:20:21 <kchibisov>	with nvidia - no.
Mar 19 18:20:48 <nixpulvis>	last time I tried to play WoW (not currently active) on Linux, it was a mess.
Mar 19 18:21:01 <kchibisov>	lutris + dxvk?
Mar 19 18:21:22 <kchibisov>	just click, click, and click play.
Mar 19 18:21:32 <nixpulvis>	hmmmm, nope. Maybe that'll do a better job
Mar 19 18:22:01 <kchibisov>	you need Vulkan though.
Mar 19 18:22:22 <kchibisov>	not sure whether NVIDIA supports it on Linux in their binary blob driver.
Mar 19 18:22:27 <nixpulvis>	sure
Mar 19 18:22:41 <nixpulvis>	they state that they do...
Mar 19 18:22:44 <nixpulvis>	but...
Mar 19 18:22:54 <nixpulvis>	1.1 anyway.
Mar 19 18:26:33 <cole-h>	Doesn't help that Blizzard is/was actively hostile to its Linux users lol

Mar 20 12:25:51 <danyspin97>	i am trying right now the Focus hook in kakoune and it doesn't receive the event
Mar 20 12:26:10 <kchibisov>	but HollowCursor works?
Mar 20 12:26:22 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:26:24 <danyspin97>	"[2020-03-20 12:24:01.679761863] [INFO] glutin event: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(Wayland(WindowId(94589361942368))), event: Focused(false) }"
Mar 20 12:26:38 <kchibisov>	so so focus events are working.
Mar 20 12:27:03 <danyspin97>	but the client (kakoune) isn't receiving them
Mar 20 12:27:18 <kchibisov>	why they should receive it?
Mar 20 12:28:18 <danyspin97>	windows get updated based on the focus
Mar 20 12:28:43 <kchibisov>	Hm, so there should be espca, etc.
Mar 20 12:28:48 <danyspin97>	i.e. there is tagbar window that updates its contents based on which window is focused
Mar 20 12:29:43 <danyspin97>	what do you mean by "espca"
Mar 20 12:29:53 <kchibisov>	Could you provide me `alacritty -vvv` output?
Mar 20 12:30:00 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:30:01 <kchibisov>	during repro ofc.
Mar 20 12:33:06 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKy
Mar 20 12:34:16 <kchibisov>	Oh, could you also include `--print-events` to it?
Mar 20 12:34:20 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:36:05 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKA
Mar 20 12:36:50 <kchibisov>	Could you provide the same output from v0.4.1?
Mar 20 12:37:06 <kchibisov>	For now it seems like your editor bug.
Mar 20 12:37:52 <danyspin97>	I cannot compile prior to 0.4.1-rc1 :/
Mar 20 12:38:06 <kchibisov>	how so?
Mar 20 12:38:20 <kchibisov>	Ah, you don't have x11.
Mar 20 12:38:24 <danyspin97>	I needed the x11/wayland features patch
Mar 20 12:38:34 <kchibisov>	you can patch v0.4.1.
Mar 20 12:38:46 <kchibisov>	just apply this patch on v0.4.1, it should work.
Mar 20 12:42:52 <kchibisov>	If you have any issue applying the patch let me know.
Mar 20 12:44:28 <danyspin97>	in the end I'm compiling xcb, I'll remove it later
Mar 20 12:45:01 <kchibisov>	it should be applied just fine.
Mar 20 12:45:26 <kchibisov>	like I don't see why it should fail?
Mar 20 12:46:42 <kchibisov>	yeah, the last time we've touched related file were on v0.4.0.
Mar 20 12:47:06 <danyspin97>	i don't see the patch :/
Mar 20 12:47:08 <kchibisov>	so you can safely apply 4000ec04d89b9bd77995960d2a9da8fcad55e003 to v0.4.1.
Mar 20 12:47:50 <danyspin97>	but anyway, I've recompiled alacritty from source, v0.4.1
Mar 20 12:48:14 <kchibisov>	nice, I need the same output.
Mar 20 12:50:26 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKF
Mar 20 12:52:57 <kchibisov>	I'll assume it works on it?
Mar 20 12:53:11 <danyspin97>	it doesn't
Mar 20 12:53:20 <kchibisov>	lul
Mar 20 12:53:54 <kchibisov>	So when did it work last time?
Mar 20 12:54:26 <kchibisov>	this patch could be applied even on v0.4.0, just saying.
Mar 20 12:54:44 <danyspin97>	I don't know, it is the first time I check this hook :/
Mar 20 12:55:13 <kchibisov>	the problem is that it unsets the mode.
Mar 20 12:55:19 <kchibisov>	as you can see in a log.
Mar 20 12:55:26 <kchibisov>	Like it sets it and then unsets it.
Mar 20 12:57:22 <kchibisov>	Are you sure that it works at all and it's not an editor bug?
Mar 20 12:58:28 <danyspin97>	I was talking in #kakoune before and they said me it had to be on alacritty end :/ I can try on x11 on another system and check
Mar 20 12:58:53 <kchibisov>	this is not a problem in wayland, etc.
Mar 20 12:59:06 <kchibisov>	The problem that your editor resets mode.
Mar 20 12:59:12 <kchibisov>	so it sets mode and then resets.
Mar 20 12:59:22 <danyspin97>	alacritty receive the "focused" event so I guess that is not related to sway
Mar 20 12:59:41 <kchibisov>	As I said, the problem is on a different level.
Mar 20 12:59:49 <danyspin97>	give me 5 minutes and I try it on x11
Mar 20 12:59:49 <kchibisov>	it's not gui related, etc.
Mar 20 12:59:53 <kchibisov>	don't do that.
Mar 20 12:59:57 <kchibisov>	it's just a waste of time.
Mar 20 13:00:10 <danyspin97>	hmm okay
Mar 20 13:00:50 <kchibisov>	The problem in escape sequences from your editor.
Mar 20 13:01:09 <danyspin97>	Ah
Mar 20 13:01:41 <kchibisov>	So it send escape to enable Focus hook, and then disable it.
Mar 20 13:02:02 <kchibisov>	Read the log for ReportFocusInOut
Mar 20 13:02:58 <kchibisov>	So they are sending reset of this mode right away after setting it for whatever reason.
Mar 20 13:03:34 <kchibisov>	try echo -e "\e[?1004h", then `cat` and try to refocus.
Mar 20 13:03:45 <kchibisov>	you'll see this hook getting triggered.
Mar 20 13:06:23 <danyspin97>	I see
Mar 20 13:07:40 <kchibisov>	were you talking to them now?
Mar 20 13:07:49 <kchibisov>	your editor folks?
Mar 20 13:07:50 <danyspin97>	https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/6766297623e9718db5b2b09bd655fe183acdcf67/src/ncurses_ui.cc#L1256
Mar 20 13:07:56 <danyspin97>	may this be related?
Mar 20 13:08:16 <kchibisov>	we have sgr mouse support.

Apr 02 15:54:29 <larsks>	I've installed the "Fira Mono" font family on my system, and it's visible in other applications (e.g. as "Fira Mono Regular"), but trying to set font.normal.family to "Fira Mono" or "Fira Mono Regular" isn't working. Other fonts seem to work fine. Any thoughts on what I'm missing?
Apr 02 15:55:02 <kchibisov>	Could you should your config file?
Apr 02 15:55:17 <kchibisov>	show*
Apr 02 15:56:58 <larsks>	Sure, just a second.
Apr 02 15:57:16 <kchibisov>	Also, on what platform are you?
Apr 02 15:58:32 <larsks>	I'm on Fedora 31.  Config file is here: https://termbin.com/10ji
Apr 02 15:58:57 <larsks>	Normal font is currently set to "terminus" in that config.
Apr 02 15:59:15 <kchibisov>	Could you run `fc-list | grep -i fira`?
Apr 02 16:00:41 <larsks>	Sure, that gets: https://termbin.com/253s
Apr 02 16:01:21 <kchibisov>	Well it should be just `Fira Mono` in a config.
Apr 02 16:01:47 <kchibisov>	also, make sure to restart terminal if your font was added after terminal startup.
Apr 02 16:01:53 <larsks>	Yeah, that was my thought, too :)
Apr 02 16:02:00 <larsks>	I'll try restarting the terminal...
Apr 02 16:02:54 <larsks>	That was it. I didn't think that would be necessary. Thanks!
Apr 02 16:03:12 <kchibisov>	I mean it's only necessary in case the font was added after startup.
Apr 02 16:03:53 <kchibisov>	Like fontconfig just continues to report that it's not presented, etc.
Apr 02 16:04:06 <kchibisov>	But maybe we can do something about it.

Apr 02 23:54:54 <lovesegfault>	Working flawlessly on NixOS
Apr 02 23:55:03 <lovesegfault>	Color emoji looks great
Apr 02 23:55:23 <lovesegfault>	🦀
Apr 02 23:55:50 <kchibisov>	nothing was changed in this regard from v0.4.1 to v0.4.2 though.
Apr 02 23:56:12 <kchibisov>	but thx.
Apr 02 23:56:42 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Well, they started working for me :D
Apr 02 23:57:19 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Your font fallback was part of 0.4.2, right?

Apr 03 09:19:03 <kchibisov>	noxid: this option is missunderstood by the users, we won't bring it back.
Apr 03 09:19:42 <noxid>	thanks for the reply
Apr 03 09:22:02 <kchibisov>	note, no terminal emulator allows this setting at all.
Apr 03 09:23:21 <storm\>	kchibisov: would it be possible to do a hour walkthrough of the code at somepoint to get me up to speed?
Apr 03 09:23:30 <storm\>	if thats something you would be comftable doing
Apr 03 09:24:04 <kchibisov>	I mean it depens on an issue you're trying to solve storm\ .
Apr 03 09:24:36 <storm\>	first issue ill solve is the locale we talked about for osx yesterday
Apr 03 09:24:44 <storm\>	but i would like to have some words attatched to the code base maybe
Apr 03 09:25:03 <storm\>	mostly because im new to rust, but deep knowledge in objc
Apr 03 09:25:12 <kchibisov>	well, for locale, you should be aware only about this single file.
Apr 03 09:25:28 <storm\>	yeah i know for THAT issue :)
Apr 03 09:25:29 <kchibisov>	and likely the code that is calling it.
Apr 03 09:25:39 <storm\>	but its more a breif overview of the project.
Apr 03 09:25:46 <storm\>	i plan to fix more than JUST that hehe.
Apr 03 09:26:11 <kchibisov>	I mean you can ask what you want to fix and we'll give more specific replies.
Apr 03 09:26:30 <storm\>	hehe okay, i think you are missing the point :)
Apr 03 09:26:36 <storm\>	its cool
Apr 03 09:26:45 <kchibisov>	I mean you can just read from main.rs
Apr 03 09:27:05 <storm\>	and thats missing the point again :)
Apr 03 09:27:10 <kchibisov>	and if your bug is in specific component of it, you can go there and read it.
Apr 03 09:27:54 <kchibisov>	Like our structure is pretty simple and you can use file names to understand how everything structured.
Apr 03 09:28:30 <storm\>	yeah ive been through it.
Apr 03 09:28:50 <kchibisov>	But in general, font is in font crate, alacritty is gui + rendering, alacritty_terminal is just terminal + PTY.
Apr 03 09:30:13 <storm\>	ill just ask about the coding releated questions and decisions then, no worries.
Apr 03 09:52:03 <kchibisov>	I mean it's hard to answer of an abstract questions.
Apr 03 09:52:38 <kchibisov>	Like if you want to implement feature X, I can likely give more information about it.
Apr 03 10:26:37 <sidh>	Greetings
Apr 03 10:27:41 <storm\>	Hey
Apr 03 11:26:00 <Hamilton>	Is there sth wrong with Alacritty right-click->copy or the problem is my setuo?
Apr 03 11:32:56 <kchibisov_>	Right click does nothing
Apr 03 11:33:45 <kchibisov_>	It doesn’t reset selection anymore, etc.
Apr 03 11:33:47 <Hamilton>	kchibisov_, oh select copies. Still sometime it doesn't work it seems...not sure
Apr 03 11:34:14 <kchibisov_>	I mean copy is select and LMB release
Apr 03 14:27:32 <nixpulvis>	Hey, catching up on PRs/issues today, had a surprise April 1st deadline lol.
Apr 03 14:30:24 <sidh>	I would need your advices : I installed alacritty on Hgh sierra osx and I installed alacritty-colorscheme, I downloded themes and when I run alacritty-colorscheme -C whereis/themes-dir -T, I got "Bad configuration file"
Apr 03 14:31:24 <sidh>	configuration file is retrived from alacritty git repo
Apr 03 14:31:36 <sidh>	is there a way to have log or debug
Apr 03 14:32:29 <nixpulvis>	I've honestly never heard of the tool `alacritty-colorscheme`.
Apr 03 14:33:21 <nixpulvis>	sidh: logging is done with -v, -vv, and -vvv. But config errors should report in the red error bar.
Apr 03 14:33:40 <ifreund>	me neither but i found a github repo https://github.com/toggle-corp/alacritty-colorscheme
Apr 03 14:33:44 <sidh>	https://github.com/toggle-corp/alacritty-colorscheme
Apr 03 14:35:19 <nixpulvis>	What's the config error?
Apr 03 14:35:47 <sidh>	ok so it is not alacritty itself , it is pure related to this third party tool
Apr 03 14:35:58 <nixpulvis>	I would assume so.
Apr 03 14:36:16 <sidh>	alacritty-colorscheme -C ~/.config/alacritty/.eendroroy-alacritty-theme/themes/ -t solarized_light.yaml solarized_dark.yaml
Apr 03 14:36:34 <sidh>	Bad configuration file.
Apr 03 14:36:42 <sidh>	that's all
Apr 03 14:36:49 <ifreund>	i'm really struggling to figure out why this is useful, how often do you change colorschemes?
Apr 03 14:38:15 <sidh>	ifreund: in fact I have 3 27" screens , and I vanted to try several coloscheme to avoid the headache due to those glossy screens
Apr 03 14:39:04 <sidh>	tipically balck background are not bearable
Apr 03 14:39:08 <sidh>	black
Apr 03 14:40:10 <ifreund>	ok, but you can just edit the alacritty config right? (i'd recommend solarized dark by the way, super easy on the eyes)
Apr 03 14:43:59 <nixpulvis>	I personally find copying and pasting and commenting my config to work pretty well for testing purposes.
Apr 03 14:44:38 <nixpulvis>	The main thing I've conosidered a tool for is switching between a light and dark theme, however that tool wouldn't need to be that complex... just a simple symlink update.
Apr 03 14:46:10 *	nixpulvis still needs to find the time to make a color scheme based off #161616.
Apr 03 14:46:30 <ifreund>	yeah, it's a problem that's solved by a basic shell script, that python tool is like the definition of bloat
Apr 03 14:47:02 <nixpulvis>	most are
Apr 03 14:56:04 <caveman>	u guys need to add image viewing inside alacritty.
Apr 03 14:56:18 <kchibisov>	caveman: go ahead and add it.
Apr 03 14:56:41 <caveman>	got better things to do.
Apr 03 14:56:49 <kchibisov>	if you're just pinging us with 'you need to do X' it's not productive and just wasting our time.
Apr 03 14:57:00 <kchibisov>	and your time.
Apr 03 14:57:18 <caveman>	no.  i'm just giving u ideas.  u can ignore them.  i'm happy with st.  i am just being kind to share thoughts.
Apr 03 14:57:34 <caveman>	or re-inforcing ideas u had.
Apr 03 14:57:43 <ifreund>	no you're being a jerk
Apr 03 14:57:49 <kchibisov>	ifreund++
Apr 03 14:58:00 <caveman>	how so?
Apr 03 14:58:09 <UndeadLeech>	Also image rendering is mostly pointless in a terminal emulator.
Apr 03 14:58:09 <caveman>	now getting feedback means being a jerk?
Apr 03 14:58:23 <UndeadLeech>	You're not giving constructive feedback.
Apr 03 14:58:26 <kchibisov>	just read issue on github about image thing.
Apr 03 14:58:33 <caveman>	ifreund: the only jerk here is u right now.  calling someone 'jerk' for sharing on topic thoughts.
Apr 03 14:59:35 <caveman>	UndeadLeech: it's really useful and increases productivity.  specially that u r in the gpu accelerated business, pics is one of the main wins.
Apr 03 14:59:48 <UndeadLeech>	It's really not.
Apr 03 15:00:08 <caveman>	how to u browse images in ur directories?  open them by feh?  feh *?
Apr 03 15:00:21 <kchibisov>	this is how it should done?
Apr 03 15:00:36 <UndeadLeech>	I indeed do not use a program meant to render text to browser my images. Shocking, I know.
Apr 03 15:01:01 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: how are you even alive with such habbits?
Apr 03 15:01:20 <kchibisov>	oh, yeah, you're undead.
Apr 03 15:01:41 <UndeadLeech>	;)
Apr 03 15:01:55 <kchibisov>	anyway, browsing images in terminal seems a bit off tbh, however if there're will be a standard protocol to do so, we're fine with adding it.
Apr 03 15:02:01 <kchibisov>	for now there's only sixel.
Apr 03 15:02:09 <caveman>	for all the megs of rams u consume, u better render images.
Apr 03 15:02:24 <caveman>	u can't act like alacritty is some conservative terminal of the 80s, where it only renders text.
Apr 03 15:02:37 <caveman>	heck, even st terminal can render pics in it, and it is much more efficient than alacritty.
Apr 03 15:02:47 <UndeadLeech>	We can do whatever we want?
Apr 03 15:02:55 <UndeadLeech>	Seriously, stop being so toxic.
Apr 03 15:02:55 <kchibisov>	^
Apr 03 15:03:05 <nixpulvis>	^
Apr 03 15:03:15 <kchibisov>	if you don't like something just create your own terminal, I don't see a problem.
Apr 03 15:03:19 <caveman>	absolutely.  u can do watever u want.  including being a total dick to ppl who come here to kindly give u some thoughts.
Apr 03 15:03:27 <nixpulvis>	I'm not opposed to images in the terminal FWIW.

Apr 03 15:04:10 <UndeadLeech>	You'd think after getting banned from Kitty's github already, people would learn.
Apr 03 15:04:13 <nixpulvis>	like, search for the issue at least a little bit too...
Apr 03 15:04:58 *	UndeadLeech has kicked caveman from #alacritty (caveman)
Apr 03 15:05:31 <sidh>	ok I will uninstall it and put directly the color block
Apr 03 15:06:15 <ifreund>	sidh: if you want a nice collection of colorschemes to try out, check out this repo https://github.com/aaron-williamson/base16-alacritty
Apr 03 15:06:39 <Yaniel>	nixpulvis: tbh if someone asked for it with that attitude I'd oppose it purely out of spite
Apr 03 15:07:18 <kchibisov>	Yaniel: this is not the first time, they're just annoying.
Apr 03 15:08:19 <nixpulvis>	Yaniel: I wouldn't blame you... Though it's best to not take it out on the feature :P
Apr 03 15:08:40 <nixpulvis>	Yea, caveman has been doing this a bunch. Now he's DMing me....
Apr 03 15:08:46 <Yaniel>	classic
Apr 03 15:08:51 <Yaniel>	get banned, DM the mods
Apr 03 15:09:21 <Yaniel>	at least he's not stooping down to ban evasion
Apr 03 15:09:36 <Yaniel>	unlike someone on the opengl channel
Apr 03 15:09:56 <nixpulvis>	Apperently we're all "suicidal jerks".

Apr 03 23:46:49 <nixpulvis>	The PSU passes "self test", and the GPU clearly gets power during that time (side LEDs come on).

Apr 04 22:02:07 <kchibisov>	what background opacity setting do you have in alacritty?
Apr 04 22:04:00 <saber1>	kchibisov: 0.95
Apr 04 22:04:21 <kchibisov>	could you try 0.0, idk.
Apr 04 22:04:25 <kchibisov>	it should work.
Apr 04 22:11:28 <kchibisov>	I'd also recommend to try without empty compton config.
Apr 04 22:13:54 <saber1>	kchibisov: it's working now, turned my background image was too dark, so I didn't notice it was transparent, silly me..thanks for the help
Apr 04 22:20:00 <wma>	any idea about why scrolling a TUI with mouse causes flicker but scrolling with keyboard doesn't?
Apr 04 22:20:07 <wma>	things like manpages, weechat
Apr 04 22:20:21 <kchibisov>	depends on your intense and how the app is handling it.
Apr 04 22:20:38 <kchibisov>	but basically the problem is in how applications are writing content.
Apr 04 22:21:30 <kchibisov>	if it updates content with multiple writes you can see a flicker sometimes.
Apr 04 22:21:38 <kchibisov>	since we can render it in the middle of update.
Apr 04 22:22:24 <kchibisov>	We don't know app's content update status, so we're just drawing all the time without any delay.
Apr 04 22:22:33 <wma>	I'll test lowering the mouse scroll step to 1
Apr 04 22:24:11 <kchibisov>	note, one way to solve this thing is to delay rendering.
Apr 04 22:24:19 <kchibisov>	which is not an option.
Apr 04 22:24:37 <kchibisov>	this thing is done by a lot of terminal emulators IIRC, which is just wrong.
Apr 04 22:27:22 <wma>	yes, I think this flickering didn't happen with kitty
Apr 04 22:28:15 <kchibisov>	yeah, even xterm has like 22ms of delay IIRC.
Apr 04 22:28:56 <kchibisov>	The one solution that makes sense is syncronized updates.
Apr 04 22:29:24 <kchibisov>	However it requires application support.
Apr 04 22:29:30 <kchibisov>	and a terminal.
Apr 04 22:29:37 <kchibisov>	but this thing is something reliable.
Apr 04 23:11:16 *	kchibisov was thinking that alacritty was freezing on focus change, but he was accidentally using 1.25 thickness for cursor from some old experiment, so HollowBlock cursor was just block cursor.
Apr 04 23:11:27 <kchibisov>	it took me like 30 minutes to realize that.

Apr 04 23:45:41 <kchibisov>	Oh, god, winit can't work in pair with frame callbacks properly.
Apr 04 23:45:53 <UndeadLeech>	Hm?
Apr 04 23:45:57 <kchibisov>	it blows up.
Apr 04 23:46:05 <UndeadLeech>	You mean with them in Alacritty?
Apr 04 23:46:11 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 04 23:46:17 <kchibisov>	it just sends shit ton of stupid events.
Apr 04 23:46:32 <kchibisov>	like their redraw requested logic just explodes
Apr 04 23:47:02 <kchibisov>	it's a constant spam of events, etc.
Apr 04 23:48:53 <kchibisov>	but it works so good with frame callbacks tbh.
Apr 04 23:49:20 <kchibisov>	like resize glitches are solved with them.
Apr 04 23:49:37 <kchibisov>	but yeah, I should investigate why winit blows up when I'm using them.
Apr 04 23:49:59 <kchibisov>	I feel like the problem is that I dispatch_queue each time in run_return;
Apr 04 23:50:07 <kchibisov>	and it triggers redraw_requested for me.
Apr 04 23:53:37 <kchibisov>	So I guess I should make it in winit.
Apr 04 23:53:49 <kchibisov>	like this even spam isn't good.
Apr 04 23:56:24 <kchibisov>	yeah, I'll publish PR, just for some folks to try it, but I'll should add it into winit.
Apr 04 23:57:23 <kchibisov>	since it fixes glitches + updates.
Apr 04 23:57:31 <kchibisov>	I mean offscreen updates.
Apr 04 23:59:32 <UndeadLeech>	Resize glitches shouldn't matter anymore. I've decided I'm just going to remove the ability to resize from X/Wayland/Windows/macOS.
Apr 04 23:59:39 <UndeadLeech>	That would make things a lot easier.
Apr 04 23:59:43 <kchibisov>	true.
Apr 05 00:07:13 <kchibisov>	though we
Apr 05 00:07:26 <kchibisov>	though, we'll have special flag to redraw on wayland anyway.
Apr 05 00:07:58 <kchibisov>	Like you're setting dirty in it right now, which is kind of true, but on Wayland, you can't draw without it.
Apr 05 00:08:37 <kchibisov>	so you'll have one bool flag anyway.
Apr 05 00:26:34 <kchibisov>	btw, I can't repo any glitches due to partical write on my branch.
Apr 05 00:26:43 <kchibisov>	or they are really hard.
Apr 05 00:28:46 <kchibisov>	Well, actually only on resize it's possible right now.
Apr 05 00:29:08 <kchibisov>	Like when I fullscreen vim I see this kind of flicker.
Apr 05 00:40:01 <UndeadLeech>	Okay, I think I'll move the cursors on the grid, then pass a callback to reflow, remove rotation of selection from grid by moving selection to term and hopefully that'll be semi clean.
Apr 05 00:40:22 <kchibisov>	Reflow callbacks oO
Apr 05 00:40:46 <UndeadLeech>	Just something simple, like passing a closure to reflow which is called when a line is added/removed.
Apr 05 00:41:07 <UndeadLeech>	Instead of passing points. So that we can keep all the logic in that closure instead of having to iterate over the points in reflow.
Apr 05 00:41:28 <UndeadLeech>	I might make it a trait and store selection/vi cursor on a struct implementing it.
Apr 05 00:42:21 <UndeadLeech>	It's mostly to prevent havig to add a for loop to reflow for every time any of the points is modified, hopefully keeping it a bit cleaner.
Apr 05 00:43:05 <UndeadLeech>	And storing the points on grid means we don't need to search the points for the smallest line to determine rotation.
Apr 05 00:45:26 <kchibisov>	I really wonder how atomics should be done in a most performant way.
Apr 05 00:45:31 <kchibisov>	like I feel like mutex was better for me.
Apr 05 00:46:19 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Apr 05 00:46:34 <kchibisov>	I mean I feel like I'm messing up order from time to time.
Apr 05 00:46:34 <UndeadLeech>	Atomics should be pretty fast, you just using store/load with relaxed ordering?
Apr 05 00:46:50 <UndeadLeech>	Which ordering do you use?
Apr 05 00:48:29 <kchibisov>	Acquire for load and Release for store.
Apr 05 00:48:37 <kchibisov>	I feel like I should use Relaxed for store.
Apr 05 00:48:43 <UndeadLeech>	Have you tried relaxed for everything, just for testing?
Apr 05 00:48:52 <kchibisov>	load can't use relaxed
Apr 05 00:49:14 <kchibisov>	Oh, I'm wrong.
Apr 05 00:49:19 <kchibisov>	It could use Relaxed.
Apr 05 00:49:25 <kchibisov>	I've read it in a wrong way.
Apr 05 00:50:13 <kchibisov>	let me try relaxed.
Apr 05 00:52:56 <UndeadLeech>	I mean SeqCst is probably the least error prone I'd assume.
Apr 05 00:53:19 <kchibisov>	I thought about that, but I only read.
Apr 05 00:53:27 <kchibisov>	And stores should be before.
Apr 05 00:53:46 <kchibisov>	I mean I store pretty rare, and the other time I just read it.
Apr 05 00:55:00 <UndeadLeech>	SeqCst is the slowest, so probably shouldn't be used unless you really need it.
Apr 05 00:55:41 <kchibisov>	I feel like I'm fine with relaxed tbh.
Apr 05 00:55:57 <UndeadLeech>	That's usually how I feel too.
Apr 05 00:56:40 <UndeadLeech>	Especially because wrapping my head around that gets me confused literally every single time I use it.
Apr 05 00:56:53 <UndeadLeech>	So I mostly just end up trial and erroring my way through.
Apr 05 01:00:29 <kchibisov>	However I'm not really sure that it was a right thing to use Relaxed.
Apr 05 01:00:39 <kchibisov>	just logically I need Release + Acquire

Apr 10 15:56:28 <ubitux>	http://b.pkh.me/s/2020-04-10-165604_598x421_scrot.png i wonder if it's possible to have a color palette respecting the semantic where everything is always readable
Apr 10 15:58:27 <ubitux>	typically: magenta/red, yellow/green

Apr 11 09:38:52 <Hamilton>	How to spawn an alacritty window with a start command and make it stick? alacritty -r "ls" disappers after running the command
Apr 11 09:40:30 <Hamilton>	I'm not looking for a keybinding inside alacritty but a switch for alacritty cli app to run a new instance, execute a command and stay there
Apr 11 09:42:27 <kchibisov>	Hamilton: --hold.
Apr 11 09:42:34 <kchibisov>	type --help for help.
Apr 11 09:44:25 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, okay it holds but I can't interact with it any further
Apr 11 09:44:42 <kchibisov>	yes, because you've told it do so.
Apr 11 09:45:00 <Hamilton>	I'm using a wm. I want a certain key to 1- launch alacritty 2- execute a start command 3- let me do other things with it
Apr 11 09:45:29 <kchibisov>	just run your shell and make it run things?
Apr 11 09:46:08 <kchibisov>	other things means shell, not just command.
Apr 11 09:46:27 <kchibisov>	Hold is only useful, if you're running app and want to keep output.
Apr 11 09:46:58 <Hamilton>	exec "alacritty" && "ls"?
Apr 11 09:48:25 <kchibisov>	alacritty -e sh -c "ls; exec sh"
Apr 11 09:49:37 <Hamilton>	Thanks https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/82783/306382
Apr 11 09:58:43 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, https://pastebin.com/sXa7Kxg9
Apr 11 09:58:59 <Hamilton>	xfce4-terminal works (with an error) but alacritty doesn't spawn
Apr 11 09:59:35 <kchibisov>	Do you see "" things in my example?
Apr 11 09:59:55 <kchibisov>	I mean to quote the entire thing.
Apr 11 10:00:05 <kchibisov>	like you shouldn't use it, since it's one argument.
Apr 11 10:00:13 <Hamilton>	alacritty -e "bash -c 'ls;exec $SHELL'"
Apr 11 10:00:23 <kchibisov>	should be alacritty -e bash -c 'ls;exec $SHELL'
Apr 11 10:00:45 <Hamilton>	so -e is not like exec ""
Apr 11 10:00:50 <kchibisov>	yes.
Apr 11 10:00:57 <kchibisov>	we're not launching it in shell by default.
Apr 11 10:01:11 <kchibisov>	like it's a command with arguments.
Apr 11 10:01:59 <Hamilton>	*sigh* now it works but no scroll up :)
Apr 11 10:02:36 <Hamilton>	It's okay. Doesn't matter. Thanks
Apr 11 10:02:56 <kchibisov>	what do you mean by `scroll up`?
Apr 11 10:06:31 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, if ls is long, it just shows the final 4 lines or sho
Apr 11 10:07:02 <kchibisov>	works for me?
Apr 11 10:07:11 <kchibisov>	I can scroll, etc.
Apr 11 10:08:12 <kchibisov>	So your prompt should be in the bottom of the screen if your output is too long.
Apr 11 10:10:35 <kchibisov>	Well if you can repro everytime I can debug this thing.
Apr 11 10:13:14 <kchibisov>	Just set history value in config to some value like 300 and do `alacritty --ref-test -e sh -c "ls -lah; ls -lah; exec sh"`
Apr 11 10:13:34 <kchibisov>	it should create 4 files, and I need only alacritty.recording from them.
Apr 11 10:28:04 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, I did a 4 ls -lah it works. It was printing everything. I thought I was doing a ls -a instead
Apr 11 10:28:38 <Hamilton>	and ls -a scrolls properly also
Apr 11 10:37:29 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, What distro/DE/wm do you yourself use?"
Apr 11 10:37:44 <kchibisov>	gentoo + sway
Apr 11 10:37:50 <Hamilton>	oof
Apr 11 10:38:12 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, On a laptop?
Apr 11 10:39:12 <kchibisov>	yeah, and on a desktop.
Apr 11 18:26:52 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Oh, looks like GitHub stored my previous review...
Apr 11 18:27:20 <UndeadLeech>	That's a bit strange.
Apr 11 18:31:22 <UndeadLeech>	Not sure if that's a bug or a feature.
Apr 11 20:57:38 <kchibisov>	I wonder if we can have one thread around to do various kind of strange things to not block alacritty.
Apr 11 20:57:45 <kchibisov>	and a channel to send requests to it.
Apr 11 20:58:13 <kchibisov>	e.g. launching commands, etc.
Apr 11 20:58:37 <kchibisov>	clipboard interop.
Apr 11 20:58:43 <UndeadLeech>	Seems easier to just spawn them and get rid of them.
Apr 11 20:58:52 <UndeadLeech>	Since 99% of the time there won't be one.
Apr 11 20:59:03 <kchibisov>	yeah, but what if you spawm a ton of them.
Apr 11 20:59:16 <kchibisov>	like imagine triggers proposal + bell spam.
Apr 11 21:00:20 <kchibisov>	Though, I haven't measured if it's slow or not tbh.
Apr 11 21:14:27 <UndeadLeech>	Even then it wouldn't be a big deal.
Apr 11 21:14:37 <UndeadLeech>	That's not 'a ton' when it comes to threads.

Apr 12 00:02:21 <ifreund>	maybe that says something about the average mac user
Apr 12 00:02:46 <kchibisov>	The problem that it prevents me from fixing other shit.
Apr 12 00:03:26 <kchibisov>	Like if I want to create new API + test that things will work on macOS with it, it just won't be done by someone else.
Apr 12 00:04:32 <kchibisov>	Just hope that qemu boots up
Apr 12 00:11:10 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Which issue specifically?
Apr 12 00:11:19 <kchibisov>	just pick random font issue.
Apr 12 00:11:36 <kchibisov>	and pick random macOS winit issue.
Apr 12 00:12:04 <UndeadLeech>	I mean the same could be said about Windows.
Apr 12 00:12:25 <kchibisov>	On Windows we have davidhewitt.
Apr 12 00:12:41 <kchibisov>	and everything is mostly done on Windows font's side.
Apr 12 00:13:04 <kchibisov>	and winit even has Windows maintainers from time to time and more folks around.
Apr 12 00:13:20 <UndeadLeech>	It has more macOS maintainers at the moment tbh.
Apr 12 00:13:27 <UndeadLeech>	At least from my last experiences.
Apr 12 00:13:34 <kchibisov>	macOS has 0 maintainers.
Apr 12 00:13:53 <UndeadLeech>	Who maintains Windows?
Apr 12 00:13:58 <kchibisov>	osspial.
Apr 12 00:14:37 <UndeadLeech>	Is he contributing again?
Apr 12 00:15:00 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure tbh, but Windows backend is way more stable than macOS tbh.
Apr 12 00:15:03 <kchibisov>	in winit.
Apr 12 00:15:28 <UndeadLeech>	I'm relatively familiar with both and I'm not sure I agree with it from a code perspective.
Apr 12 00:15:59 <kchibisov>	Windows is at least testable without issues.
Apr 12 00:16:43 <kchibisov>	idk, let me try to setup qemu.
Apr 12 00:20:50 <UndeadLeech>	You mean macOS?
Apr 12 00:21:00 <kchibisov>	yeah, macOS in qemu.
Apr 12 00:26:31 <Hexi>	greetings, I am trying to set a keybind for increasing font size as the defaults do not map to anything usable on my keyboard. In the config I have added 'key: Caret' in the appropriate place but it does not work. That key generates the ^ symbol when pressed but in xev it reports as 'asciicircum' rather than 'carat'
Apr 12 00:27:01 <Hexi>	But if I set it to 'asciicircum' I get a red error message immediately with a list of keys and that one not being in the list.
Apr 12 00:29:36 <UndeadLeech>	Hexi: Use `alacritty --print-events` to get the key names used by Alacritty.
Apr 12 00:29:56 <UndeadLeech>	You'll have to look at the `WindowEvent`s in the output.
Apr 12 00:30:08 <Hexi>	oh, great tip, I will give that a try, thanks!
Apr 12 00:33:04 <Hexi>	much sadness, that key returns virtual_keycode: None
Apr 12 00:33:26 <kchibisov>	you can bind by scancode.
Apr 12 00:33:47 <Hexi>	oh I see it has scancode 13, I will try
Apr 12 00:34:09 <Hexi>	yes that works! thank you so much
Apr 12 01:30:35 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: it works.
Apr 12 01:33:45 <UndeadLeech>	Alacritty in macOS VM you mean?
Apr 12 01:33:55 <kchibisov>	yes.
Apr 12 01:34:02 <UndeadLeech>	Question is for how long.
Apr 12 01:34:14 <UndeadLeech>	But yeah, that's what I did for macOS testing before I got hardware.
Apr 12 01:34:30 <UndeadLeech>	Until it broke.
Apr 12 01:34:42 <kchibisov>	If you won't touch this scam, I hope it won't break.
Apr 12 01:49:45 <UndeadLeech>	That's what I thought.
Apr 12 01:49:50 <kchibisov>	:- )
Apr 12 02:07:08 <kchibisov>	macOS in qemu seems to work faster than native macOS.
Apr 12 02:08:05 <kchibisov>	but anyway, let me try to debug those font issues.
Apr 12 02:08:48 <kchibisov>	also, UndeadLeech have you ever checked whether color you set in alacritty actually matches the color you'll get from color picker later.
Apr 12 02:12:31 <UndeadLeech>	Yes?
Apr 12 02:12:50 <kchibisov>	So I'll just ignore wierd color mismatch for now.
Apr 12 02:13:30 <kchibisov>	Also, have you checked that default color for background in terminal.app matches the color in a config.
Apr 12 02:13:35 <UndeadLeech>	Are you testing with text or background?
Apr 12 02:13:42 <kchibisov>	background
Apr 12 02:13:55 <UndeadLeech>	Why would I check Terminal.app background?
Apr 12 02:14:14 <kchibisov>	Just to check that its color value for background differs from the color specified.
Apr 12 02:14:18 <UndeadLeech>	I've never used Terminal.app.
Apr 12 02:14:38 <UndeadLeech>	It does, depending on color configuration.
Apr 12 02:14:48 <kchibisov>	IIRC they use some weird color speculation
Apr 12 02:15:25 <UndeadLeech>	I mean in theory that exists on other platforms too.
Apr 12 02:22:09 <kchibisov>	It seems like live font size reload is broken on macOS, right?
Apr 12 02:22:25 <kchibisov>	Oh, nvm.
Apr 12 02:22:46 <kchibisov>	I forget our semantic, that if you ever changed it, it won't work.
Apr 12 02:23:16 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Apr 12 02:23:18 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, the font size.
Apr 12 02:23:18 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 12 02:23:18 <UndeadLeech>	It will work when you reset it.
Apr 12 02:23:45 <kchibisov>	I don't see unicode issue on `cat /dev/urandom` tbh
Apr 12 02:24:01 <kchibisov>	like it's not freezing, at least.
Apr 12 02:24:12 <kchibisov>	testing urw is pretty hard, since it's a vm without real gpu.
Apr 12 02:31:24 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think any performance tests will be useful.
Apr 12 02:31:44 <kchibisov>	I can always compare to asrw perf.
Apr 12 02:32:00 <kchibisov>	like numbers doesn't matter, but diff in render time could matter.
Apr 12 02:32:48 <UndeadLeech>	They do matter though if you're bottlenecked by a path that is never a bottleneck on a normal machine.
Apr 12 02:34:07 <kchibisov>	I mean they correlate with my linux machine tbh.
Apr 12 02:35:13 <kchibisov>	Like ~12-16x difference in render time on asrw/urw
Apr 12 02:35:33 <kchibisov>	I mean asrw is 12-16x faster on average in render times than urw on both machines.
Apr 12 02:36:30 <kchibisov>	the problem is that on macOS it's 12ms and 100ms, but on linux it's something like 130usec and 2.3ms
Apr 12 02:38:46 <UndeadLeech>	130usec and 2.3ms are both lower than FPS though, while 100ms is not and even 12ms is getting close.
Apr 12 02:39:10 <kchibisov>	I mean it's a vm inside on qemu without GPU
Apr 12 02:39:15 <UndeadLeech>	So you're suddenly bottlenecked by rendering, while normal machines shouldn't be.
Apr 12 02:39:33 <kchibisov>	The thing I care about is render time.
Apr 12 02:39:41 <kchibisov>	I don't care about the time to run benchmark.
Apr 12 02:39:51 <kchibisov>	so I look only on render times here.
Apr 12 02:39:51 <UndeadLeech>	I mean fair enough, I'm not saying there is absolutely no point.
Apr 12 02:40:26 <kchibisov>	Also, macOS seems to do similar things in a font crate.
Apr 12 02:40:45 <kchibisov>	e.g. iterate over fallback fonts, etc.
Apr 12 02:40:53 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's fonts, there's not that much that can be done differently.
Apr 12 02:41:10 <kchibisov>	I only care about fonts.
Apr 12 02:41:20 <kchibisov>	I mean that I want to fix only fonts on macOS.
Apr 12 02:46:23 <kchibisov>	storm\: are you around?
Apr 12 03:06:08 <kchibisov>	Anyway, I need someone with macOS + kitty to test one thing for me.
Apr 12 03:09:40 <UndeadLeech>	What do you need tested, I might be able to look into it tomorrow?
Apr 12 03:09:44 <UndeadLeech>	Assuming you mean native macOS?
Apr 12 03:10:04 <kchibisov>	Oh, actually I can test kitty myself.
Apr 12 03:10:21 <kchibisov>	I forgot that I actually have macOS.
Apr 12 03:10:33 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Apr 12 03:10:35 <kchibisov>	the problem that it looks like shit on my system, so debugging font quality is hard.
Apr 12 03:10:42 <UndeadLeech>	What do you want to look into?
Apr 12 03:10:53 <kchibisov>	thin_strokes thing
Apr 12 03:11:24 <kchibisov>	AFAICKS kitty is using CGContextSetLineWidth to impl it.
Apr 12 03:12:00 <kchibisov>	iterm has a shit ton of strange heuristic based logic to handle fonts.
Apr 12 03:16:38 <kchibisov>	Oh, I can't test it.
Apr 12 03:16:48 <kchibisov>	it requires OpenGL 4.0+ I guess.
Apr 12 03:17:03 <UndeadLeech>	Great.
Apr 12 03:17:06 <kchibisov>	Like it crashes with GL error on start.
Apr 12 03:17:16 <kchibisov>	and they blame us for OpenGL 3.3
Apr 12 03:18:07 <kchibisov>	ok, let me try to understand iterm code a bit more, and I'll post the thing I want to test.

Apr 12 08:57:46 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: You around?
Apr 12 08:57:54 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 12 08:58:55 <lovesegfault>	I can't open any windows with winit 0.22 on Wayland, do none of the examples do anything?
Apr 12 08:59:08 <lovesegfault>	They run, don't crash or anything, but no window comes up
Apr 12 08:59:16 <kchibisov>	you should draw.
Apr 12 08:59:41 <kchibisov>	so you should test glutin examples, and not winit examples, since winit isn't drawing.
Apr 12 08:59:55 <lovesegfault>	So, I was trying to test this https://github.com/parasyte/pixels/pull/60
Apr 12 09:00:14 <lovesegfault>	it explodes on wayland, with Xwayland it works
Apr 12 09:00:30 <lovesegfault>	c.f. https://gist.github.com/0e38722940d17caeb4a9fd84cd6ec394
Apr 12 09:00:50 <lovesegfault>	I _think_ it's a bug in smithay?
Apr 12 09:01:40 <kchibisov>	idk, let me run your thing.
Apr 12 09:02:36 <kchibisov>	let me make some coffee. I'll be right back to you in like 15 mins.
Apr 12 09:02:42 <lovesegfault>	I'm trying the wgpu examples rn
Apr 12 09:02:45 <lovesegfault>	let's see
Apr 12 09:03:32 <Levanx>	I think you're hitting https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/793
Apr 12 09:05:30 <lovesegfault>	yep
Apr 12 09:07:20 <lovesegfault>	Levanx: Ah, yes, indeed
Apr 12 09:07:30 <lovesegfault>	Goddamn
Apr 12 09:07:49 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: how does Alacritty not hit this?
Apr 12 09:08:20 <lovesegfault>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2714
Apr 12 09:08:21 <lovesegfault>	oh
Apr 12 09:08:29 <lovesegfault>	But how does it work otherwise?
Apr 12 09:08:37 <Levanx>	(btw, fixing this is more a matter of deciding what winit should do than a technical problem)
Apr 12 09:09:20 <lovesegfault>	Yeah, I see that
Apr 12 09:13:45 <kchibisov>	yeah, the only way to hit that is Fullscreen startup mode.
Apr 12 09:13:49 <kchibisov>	in alacritty.
Apr 12 09:14:07 <kchibisov>	but you can launch normal things just fine.
Apr 12 09:15:01 <kchibisov>	I feel like the only way to solve more
Apr 12 09:15:23 <kchibisov>	more major issues like that is to port to a new SCTK and then fix them.
Apr 12 09:17:02 <kchibisov>	I feel like it's time to start porting winit to a newer SCTK.
Apr 12 09:18:07 <kchibisov>	Though, I should fix some minor issues first, but they won't be merged unless Levanx will press the button.
Apr 12 09:18:45 <Levanx>	You mean the winit maintainership is basically dead now ? :/
Apr 12 09:18:55 <kchibisov>	kind of.
Apr 12 09:19:03 <kchibisov>	so you can press the button, and I can send patches to winit.
Apr 12 09:19:17 <kchibisov>	Or we can fork winit and maintain it in alacritty.
Apr 12 09:19:22 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: How do you open a window not-fullscreen?
Apr 12 09:19:33 *	lovesegfault wonders why pixels is opening fullscreen
Apr 12 09:19:40 <Levanx>	welp
Apr 12 09:19:57 <Levanx>	I guess I can. But ping me for review then, I disabled general notifications for winit.
Apr 12 09:20:01 <kchibisov>	Like I'm fine with maintaining Wayland in winit, since alacritty requires it.
Apr 12 09:20:30 <kchibisov>	Like I don't see any reason to not use winit, but gentz was away for 2 months.
Apr 12 09:20:50 <kchibisov>	and osspial for a similar amount of time.
Apr 12 09:21:18 <kchibisov>	And other folks won't merge my shit, since it's not their platform.
Apr 12 09:21:41 <lovesegfault>	That's sad :/
Apr 12 09:21:58 <kchibisov>	But as I said, we can fork it in alacritty.
Apr 12 09:22:09 <kchibisov>	that's not a problem and was discussed already.
Apr 12 09:22:32 <Levanx>	lovesegfault: Winit is, as a whole, a pretty unrewarding thing to maintain tbh
Apr 12 09:22:48 <kchibisov>	like winit is just a wrapper, while we have smithay project it'll be fine.
Apr 12 09:24:56 <kchibisov>	lovesegfault: you shouldn't set any mods when launching.
Apr 12 09:26:10 *	lovesegfault looks
Apr 12 09:27:18 <kchibisov>	Levanx: if you don't want to spend your time reviewing random winit stuff let me know, we'll likely fork it right away then. But I don't see anyone besides me who can maintain Wayland in winit.
Apr 12 09:27:41 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: I don't think I'm setting anything? https://github.com/lovesegfault/pixels/blob/update-deps/examples/conway/main.rs#L18-L19
Apr 12 09:28:07 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Have you consider asking for a commit bit instead?
Apr 12 09:28:28 <kchibisov>	No, but there's no one I can ask for it.
Apr 12 09:28:47 <kchibisov>	unless everyone in winit has equal ownership.
Apr 12 09:28:56 <lovesegfault>	OH
Apr 12 09:28:59 <lovesegfault>	I see the issue
Apr 12 09:29:13 <kchibisov>	like osspial should be the boss, I guess, but I don't see them.
Apr 12 09:29:14 <kchibisov>	and gentz.
Apr 12 09:30:02 <Levanx>	kchibisov: If it's just reviewing & merging a few technical PRs, that's fine.
Apr 12 09:30:36 <Levanx>	I just don't want to be dragged into yet another long debate about API design abstracting over multiple platforms ._.
Apr 12 09:32:35 <Levanx>	I already restarted the momentum when francesca left, leading to the shared maintainership we had until now. I don't really want to do that a second time tbqh :/
Apr 12 09:34:21 <kchibisov>	lovesegfault: let me debug your thing.
Apr 12 09:36:33 <kchibisov>	Oh, I've got the issue.
Apr 12 09:37:05 <kchibisov>	yeah, they are calling to monitor too early.
Apr 12 09:37:23 <kchibisov>	I absolutely hate what they are doing so.
Apr 12 09:39:21 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Yeah, did you find they part where they draw the hidden window to figure out a good size?
Apr 12 09:40:20 <kchibisov>	yeah, they are doing shit.
Apr 12 09:40:37 <kchibisov>	like this code is just bad and won't work..
Apr 12 09:40:52 <kchibisov>	first of all `set_inner_size` doesn't guarantee you anything.
Apr 12 09:41:16 <kchibisov>	set_outer_position is not a thing on some systems.
Apr 12 09:42:08 <kchibisov>	Also, on HiDPI system, initial scale factor is always 1.
Apr 12 09:42:16 <kchibisov>	so you'll resize anyways.
Apr 12 09:43:23 <lovesegfault>	oh jesus the mouse handling is all fucked
Apr 12 09:43:34 <kchibisov>	I'll propose to just use scale factor instead of monitor dimensions magic, since THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE CORRECT.
Apr 12 09:43:43 <lovesegfault>	if you run and try and do line a drag (i.e. draw a line)
Apr 12 09:44:24 <kchibisov>	like just use scale factor and don't be smart.
Apr 12 09:44:40 *	lovesegfault nods
Apr 12 09:45:20 <kchibisov>	like I'm tired of some winit ideas like DPR factor 777 on X11.
Apr 12 09:45:39 <kchibisov>	because they're due to monitor dimensions.
Apr 12 09:45:39 <lovesegfault>	What's DPR?
Apr 12 09:45:49 <kchibisov>	I mean scale factor.
Apr 12 09:45:56 <kchibisov>	it's a Device Pixel Ratio.
Apr 12 09:46:13 <lovesegfault>	Ah
Apr 12 09:46:18 <lovesegfault>	Why 777 O.o
Apr 12 09:46:35 <kchibisov>	it was 719 to be more precise.
Apr 12 09:47:17 <kchibisov>	16mmx9mm 5kx1440p display or something like that.
Apr 12 09:51:07 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: I gotta go to sleep, if you have time to help fix that example code it'd be greatly appreciated; I'm trying to get that little lib back in shape, it's really handy
Apr 12 09:51:13 <lovesegfault>	thanks for all the help, gnight
Apr 12 09:52:47 <kchibisov>	note, I'm not justifing winit crash here and I don't have much time to work on `one more project`.
Apr 12 10:31:35 <basic>	waah, when i use ncurses in alacritty (compiled yesterday) it moves 2 spots, not 2
Apr 12 10:32:05 <kchibisov>	Could you explain your issue a bit more?
Apr 12 10:32:22 <kchibisov>	Oh, I guess you should remove old bindings to arrow keys.
Apr 12 10:33:10 <basic>	well, i tried to recompile my kernel, and if i use the arrow keys it moves2 instead of 1
Apr 12 10:33:23 <kchibisov>	remove default bindings.
Apr 12 10:33:36 <basic>	uhm, une second
Apr 12 10:33:45 <kchibisov>	Just leave the thing you've defined yourself.
Apr 12 10:34:20 <basic>	  - { key: Up,       mods: Shift,   chars: "\x1b[1;2A"                       } these?
Apr 12 10:34:29 <basic>	https://github.com/bananarne/dotfiles/blob/bb57071c4ae763ed6de43c55123be5536112d895/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml#L476
Apr 12 10:34:35 <kchibisov>	yeah those things.
Apr 12 10:34:48 <basic>	you want me to remove all bindings?
Apr 12 10:34:52 <kchibisov>	You can safely delete the entire section.
Apr 12 10:34:54 <basic>	like line 445 to 546
Apr 12 10:35:03 <basic>	okay, thanks
Apr 12 10:35:05 <kchibisov>	yeah, you can do that from 424
Apr 12 10:36:01 <basic>	yeah works again, thanks
Apr 12 10:36:08 <basic>	does this mean, i mapped 2 things to the arrowkey?
Apr 12 10:36:15 <basic>	(2 times the same thing)
Apr 12 10:36:26 <kchibisov>	yeah, we changed default bindings, so you've mapped twice.
Apr 12 10:36:30 <basic>	ah, cool
Apr 12 10:37:07 <kchibisov>	Like we removed bindings like a year ago, but now we actually changed all default ones, since we added one more mode, which affected all bindings.
Apr 12 10:37:23 <basic>	which mode?
Apr 12 10:37:28 <kchibisov>	Vi mode.
Apr 12 10:37:37 <basic>	UHH what does tha tmean?? that sounds interesting af
Apr 12 10:37:47 <basic>	can i copy paste in alacritty? without tmux n shit?
Apr 12 10:37:50 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 12 10:37:56 <basic>	WOAH alacritty IS the best
Apr 12 10:37:58 <basic>	how how how
Apr 12 10:37:59 <kchibisov>	Ctrl + Shift + space.
Apr 12 10:38:09 <kchibisov>	and other default vi bindings should kind of work.
Apr 12 10:38:25 <basic>	man
Apr 12 10:38:26 <basic>	that is fukin
Apr 12 10:38:30 <kchibisov>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/ab2db49af5467ec972e297259dd8c23022783347/alacritty.yml#L561
Apr 12 10:38:30 <basic>	awesome
Apr 12 10:38:37 <basic>	this is exactly what i suggested in here, half a year ago
Apr 12 10:38:44 <basic>	man that is cool
Apr 12 10:38:45 <basic>	i am so happy
Apr 12 10:39:01 <basic>	thank you for implementing this
Apr 12 10:39:10 <basic>	whoever did
Apr 12 10:39:22 <kchibisov>	note, it's still missing some useful things, but they should be added at some point.
Apr 12 10:39:36 <basic>	as long as i can copy/paste without touching the mouse
Apr 12 10:39:38 <basic>	i don't mind
Apr 12 10:40:24 <basic>	as long as i can copy/paste without touching the mouse
Apr 12 10:40:25 <basic>	hihihihi
Apr 12 10:40:52 <basic>	what would be useful, addditionally to this?
Apr 12 10:41:03 <kchibisov>	search + indicator for vi mode.
Apr 12 10:43:01 <Levanx>	BTW, Yesterday I realized alacritty now had block selection. No idea since when it is the case, but that's very cool! Thanks ❤︎
Apr 12 10:43:17 <kchibisov>	was added like a year ago also.
Apr 12 10:43:27 <basic>	search + indicator for
Apr 12 10:43:27 <basic>	, Yesterday I realized
Apr 12 10:43:30 <basic>	hohoho
Apr 12 10:43:36 <basic>	sorry, im way to happy about this
Apr 12 10:43:57 <basic>	i should follow the repository & learn to rust
Apr 12 10:44:22 <kchibisov>	You can just follow releases, I guess, since we publish very verbose changelog, so you won't miss new features.
Apr 12 10:44:57 <basic>	you should have a "read the changelog" notification :p
Apr 12 10:45:03 <basic>	with super fancy shaders
Apr 12 10:45:34 <kchibisov>	I don't see a need for such things, just read release notes.
Apr 12 10:47:12 *	Levanx just obtains new alacritty without noticing via system updates :-°
Apr 12 10:49:23 <kchibisov>	Oh, god, winit doesn't have dollar VirtualKeyCode.
Apr 12 10:49:40 <basic>	Levanx: same here
Apr 12 10:49:41 <kchibisov>	As well as some other fancy stuff.
Apr 12 10:50:13 <Levanx>	Actually, I forgot following only releases was a thing. Goona do that.
Apr 12 10:50:40 <basic>	can i change the ctrl+shift+space thing to something different?
Apr 12 10:50:45 <kchibisov>	I do the same for some projects on github, since I manually download them.
Apr 12 10:51:00 <kchibisov>	basic: yeah, read new default config.
Apr 12 10:51:06 <basic>	uhhhhhhhhh
Apr 12 10:51:14 <kchibisov>	I mean it's just new bindings.
Apr 12 10:51:30 <kchibisov>	it's called ToggleViMode.
Apr 12 10:59:38 <kchibisov>	the most interesting thing that winit has Yen keycode, but not dollar.
Apr 12 11:03:33 <storm\>	kchibisov: mac releated again, i just had time to look at code etc, and about to choose a issue to dig into
Apr 12 11:03:48 <storm\>	would you say https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2800 is the most important osx for now which is a good first one?
Apr 12 11:03:58 <kchibisov>	Oh, this is hard.
Apr 12 11:04:13 <kchibisov>	locale is the easiest one.
Apr 12 11:04:20 <kchibisov>	and the most important.
Apr 12 11:04:43 <kchibisov>	You can test it by launching Alacritty.app, typing locale and see that locale is a bit wrong.
Apr 12 11:04:53 <kchibisov>	compared to iterm2 and Terminal.app.
Apr 12 11:05:22 <kchibisov>	I've figured out the issue with thin strokes, and it's not really our fault, but we can likely have a setting similar to iterm.
Apr 12 11:05:42 <storm\>	difference for me is that kitty and terminal app writes: `LC_ALL=` and alacritty writes: LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
Apr 12 11:05:47 <storm\>	rest of them is wqual.
Apr 12 11:05:49 <storm\>	equal*
Apr 12 11:06:02 <storm\>	oh you did? nice
Apr 12 11:06:03 <kchibisov>	we don't touch LC_ALL at all.
Apr 12 11:06:16 <storm\>	okay, so let me maybe look at why that is being set.
Apr 12 11:06:28 <kchibisov>	let me launch macOS, one sec.
Apr 12 11:08:25 <kchibisov>	https://paste.rs/bvB.png
Apr 12 11:08:31 <kchibisov>	like this is the issue.
Apr 12 11:08:56 <kchibisov>	You can see iterm/terminal.app and alacritty.
Apr 12 11:09:05 <storm\>	hmm
Apr 12 11:09:06 <kchibisov>	you can notice that locale differs in LC_CTYPE
Apr 12 11:09:31 <kchibisov>	note, UTF-8 locale is shit, but whatever macOS decides.
Apr 12 11:09:46 <kchibisov>	you're likely setting locale in shell.
Apr 12 11:10:01 <storm\>	lemme check
Apr 12 11:10:03 <kchibisov>	since we don't touch LC_ALL at all.
Apr 12 11:10:17 <kchibisov>	just grep the thing for LC_ALL and how stes it.
Apr 12 11:11:23 <basic>	thnaks all!
Apr 12 11:12:24 <storm\>	yeah ok i see the problem kchibisov
Apr 12 11:13:08 <kchibisov>	so we have locale.rs file in alacritty_terminal which is purely msg_send(objective-C shit) which is trying to guess locale.
Apr 12 11:13:29 <kchibisov>	So we should do what native terminal and iterm2 are doing and end up with this UTF-8 locale.
Apr 12 11:13:41 <kchibisov>	which isn't a thing, but whatever.
Apr 12 11:13:46 <storm\>	wait hmm wtf is this.
Apr 12 11:13:47 <storm\>	hang on
Apr 12 11:15:43 <storm\>	https://imgur.com/a/cjx2beG
Apr 12 11:16:25 <storm\>	kitty and alacritty shows equals locales for me. both is not equal to terminal.app
Apr 12 11:16:34 <storm\>	terminal.app in the middle
Apr 12 11:16:44 <storm\>	alacritty to the right
Apr 12 11:17:04 <kchibisov>	yeah, terminal.app is likely correct to some point.
Apr 12 11:17:46 <kchibisov>	This is a key to display some unicode glyphs, since without it it'll blow up.
Apr 12 11:18:03 <kchibisov>	I mean apps won't render unicode chars, e.g. tmux
Apr 12 11:18:44 <kchibisov>	So my main question why iterm and terminal.app are using the same locales.
Apr 12 11:18:46 <storm\>	yeah, i had `export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"` in my zshrc which then solves the issues on all my terminal emulators
Apr 12 11:18:59 <storm\>	ill get iterm2, sec
Apr 12 11:18:59 <kchibisov>	yeah, you shouldn't do that, since it's wrong.
Apr 12 11:19:19 <kchibisov>	If you want to do that properly, it should be set in alacritty.yml for example.
Apr 12 11:20:36 <storm\>	okay so the issue is the following:
Apr 12 11:20:45 <storm\>	LC_CTYPE is not getting set properly to the correct value
Apr 12 11:20:55 <kchibisov>	I see that yeah.
Apr 12 11:20:56 <storm\>	iterm and terminal SOMEHOW gets "UTF-8"
Apr 12 11:21:09 <kchibisov>	so someone should figure out that SOMEHOW.
Apr 12 11:21:13 <storm\>	ill do that.
Apr 12 11:21:35 <kchibisov>	I'd just recommend to look at iterm code here.
Apr 12 11:21:58 <kchibisov>	and correct our locale.rs to match it.
Apr 12 11:23:10 <storm\>	yeah
Apr 12 11:28:46 <storm\>	noobie rust question #1, kchibisov: if i do some logging in the code – where would this be outputted when building it? how do you guys normally do this?
Apr 12 11:29:05 <kchibisov>	println!("PRINT");
Apr 12 11:29:16 <kchibisov>	will be output to stdout.
Apr 12 11:29:52 <kchibisov>	println!("{:?}", value); will print debug formatting for the value.
Apr 12 11:30:03 <kchibisov>	println!("{}", value); normal formatting.
Apr 12 11:30:43 <kchibisov>	so you basically do `cargo run` and see your output, if you log with `println!()`.
Apr 12 11:31:43 <storm\>	goodie
Apr 12 11:31:57 <storm\>	i feel bad for fixing alacritty in vim, in kitty.
Apr 12 11:31:59 <storm\>	:|
Apr 12 11:32:27 <kchibisov>	note, I can't test kitty at all, since it doesn't run on my macOS setup.
Apr 12 11:32:40 <storm\>	its fine
Apr 12 11:32:52 <storm\>	how do you emulate osx?
Apr 12 11:36:45 <kchibisov>	qemu.
Apr 12 11:37:24 <ifreund>	qemu is magic
Apr 12 11:37:46 <kchibisov>	I mean folks already solved that task for me, I just follow instrs and run it.
Apr 12 11:40:40 <storm\>	alrite, i think ive found the bug
Apr 12 11:41:09 <storm\>	will try to fix it, obviously take me a some more time until im comfortable in rust but whatever.
Apr 12 11:44:29 <storm\>	aaaaand kid woke up, will fix tonight.
Apr 12 12:45:29 <storm\>	kchibisov: do we want a encoding variable or something in the yml config or do we just hardcore to utf-8 encoding?
Apr 12 12:46:07 <kchibisov>	We shouldn't hardcode anything, I want to know how it works.
Apr 12 12:46:35 <storm\>	Both terminal and iterm2 sets theirs based on what you chose in their options
Apr 12 12:46:40 <kchibisov>	you can set env variables in config right now though.
Apr 12 12:47:11 <kchibisov>	So, you can make iterm to use just C?
Apr 12 12:47:25 <kchibisov>	I mean LC_CTYPE to report C.
Apr 12 12:47:26 <storm\>	No because they force you to select one
Apr 12 12:47:35 <storm\>	We set to null
Apr 12 12:47:45 <kchibisov>	Oh, could you link their code?
Apr 12 12:47:55 <kchibisov>	or where this setting is?
Apr 12 12:48:25 <storm\>	yes hang on
Apr 12 12:48:57 <storm\>	iterm2 -> pref -> terminal -> char encoding
Apr 12 12:49:24 <storm\>	that list they pull from objc api to populate the encoding options
Apr 12 12:49:31 <storm\>	and defaults to utf8 if you dont choose anything else
Apr 12 12:49:47 <kchibisov>	can we do something like that?
Apr 12 12:49:56 <storm\>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty_terminal/src/locale.rs#L63
Apr 12 12:50:14 <storm\>	yeah i guess we can
Apr 12 12:50:43 <kchibisov>	How do they handle LANG?
Apr 12 12:50:47 <kchibisov>	just leave it unset?
Apr 12 12:50:50 <storm\>	yes
Apr 12 12:51:13 <kchibisov>	So in theory we can check whether env variable is there and just set it.
Apr 12 12:51:21 <kchibisov>	if it wasn't already set.
Apr 12 12:52:15 <storm\>	from what i can see the code we have right now works fine, except the LC_CTYPE for char encoding. this we cant se on a specific case
Apr 12 12:52:49 <kchibisov>	I mean that you can set it to C.UTF-8 if LC_CTYPE was unset during run.
Apr 12 12:52:52 <kchibisov>	during startup.
Apr 12 12:52:55 <storm\>	so yes, i am wondering if we should default to UTF-8, and this can then be overwritten through the yml.
Apr 12 12:53:09 <kchibisov>	that's exactly what I'm saying.
Apr 12 12:53:17 <kchibisov>	you can set LC_CTYPE in yaml already.
Apr 12 12:53:23 <kchibisov>	it's not a problem.
Apr 12 12:53:26 <storm\>	oki
Apr 12 12:53:35 <kchibisov>	just add it to `env:` section.
Apr 12 12:53:50 <storm\>	ok ill have to play with the little one now, but will make a PR tonight
Apr 12 12:53:53 <kchibisov>	Could you link the iterm code to me.
Apr 12 12:53:56 <storm\>	yes hang on
Apr 12 12:56:54 <storm\>	hm theres another place i cant find right now but theres some of it here: https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/blob/34318c13b9031b33008852a2991dfa614c9655ae/sources/ProfilesTerminalPreferencesViewController.m#L238
Apr 12 12:58:58 <kchibisov>	I feel like all the code is in sources/PTYSession.m
Apr 12 12:59:18 <kchibisov>	I mean in iterm2, so you can just grep for LC_CTYPE.
Apr 12 12:59:40 <storm\>	Yeah will continue tonight when kid sleeps again
Apr 12 12:59:53 <storm\>	Shouldn’t be that complicated

Apr 12 18:59:36 <storm\>	I pm'ed you kchibisov to discuss locale issue im working on. Let me know when you have time to talk.
Apr 12 19:10:07 <kchibisov>	lovesegfault: are you around?
Apr 12 19:10:40 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Yeah, what's up?
Apr 12 19:11:13 <kchibisov>	Could you test one example for me?
Apr 12 19:11:19 <lovesegfault>	Sure thing
Apr 12 19:14:41 <kchibisov>	run `cargo run --example kbd_input` from https://github.com/smithay/client-toolkit and press the same keys you're pressing in winit.
Apr 12 19:18:32 <kchibisov>	You can aslo post results from xev, wev, instead of this example though.
Apr 12 19:21:28 *	lovesegfault tries wev first
Apr 12 19:22:34 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Here's wev https://gist.github.com/44cf575e432f8d92d9ac06e8f565d151
Apr 12 19:22:41 <lovesegfault>	doing smithay now
Apr 12 19:25:09 <lovesegfault>	https://gist.github.com/91a3da4f654d9ef197622c7c1f6515d7
Apr 12 19:25:11 <lovesegfault>	heh
Apr 12 19:26:23 <kchibisov>	Levanx: beep
Apr 12 19:26:38 <lovesegfault>	If I add libxkbcommon to my env it works
Apr 12 19:26:47 *	lovesegfault tries glutin now
Apr 12 19:27:23 <lovesegfault>	Yep, and now it works :)
Apr 12 19:27:26 *	lovesegfault tries crow
Apr 12 19:28:09 <kchibisov>	Could you try to `git checkout v0.6.x` in repo I've linked to you and rerun kbd_input?
Apr 12 19:28:20 <Levanx>	Yeah, you cannot really interpret Wayland keyboard input without libxkbcommon
Apr 12 19:29:10 <kchibisov>	I wonder why it crashed though.
Apr 12 19:29:56 <kchibisov>	lovesegfault: are you on NixOS?
Apr 12 19:30:16 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: yep
Apr 12 19:30:24 <lovesegfault>	Trying v0.6.x
Apr 12 19:30:28 <lovesegfault>	I'm in a nix-shell
Apr 12 19:30:42 <kchibisov>	Could you modify rpath to include libxbkcommon?
Apr 12 19:30:44 <Levanx>	Oh, the kbd_input example crashed because if mapping the keyboard with xkbcommon fails, it doesn't assign any closure to the wl_keyboard
Apr 12 19:30:46 <Levanx>	woops
Apr 12 19:31:07 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: I modified LD_LIBRARY_PATH to have libxkbcommon and it worked :^)
Apr 12 19:31:26 <kchibisov>	yeah, because it's using dlopen, so you need to patchelf.
Apr 12 19:31:35 <lovesegfault>	With that both master and 0.6.x work, without neither work
Apr 12 19:31:39 <lovesegfault>	kchibisov: Ah, I see
Apr 12 19:33:12 <kchibisov>	Could you check that winit works with this thing applied?
Apr 12 19:33:24 <kchibisov>	I mean with modified rpath
Apr 12 19:34:01 <lovesegfault>	Yes it does :)
Apr 12 19:34:07 <lovesegfault>	Thanks a lot kchibisov
Apr 12 19:34:14 <kchibisov>	So it's a nixos thing.
Apr 12 19:34:57 <lovesegfault>	Yep; but I'll add that it'd be nice if there was an option to statically link stuff and avoid this
Apr 12 19:38:08 <kchibisov>	So I guess your issue should be closed now.
Apr 12 19:49:50 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis what do you mean?
Apr 12 19:50:43 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: if winit folks won't appear in a week, we're forking it and glutin.
Apr 12 19:51:39 <kchibisov>	yourfate Could you elaborate on no colors in tmux anymore and what terminfo you've installed?
Apr 12 19:52:18 <kchibisov>	IIRC you should just have ncurses installed or whatever gives you terminfos on FreeBSD.
Apr 12 19:55:13 <nixpulvis>	kchibisov: I'm trying to reset all the syntax colors in Vim and it's litterally a nightmare.
Apr 12 19:55:17 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Might be worth opening an issue offering support?
Apr 12 19:55:22 <nixpulvis>	I recall you talking about doing something like this.
Apr 12 19:55:38 <UndeadLeech>	Maybe we can just take over when nobody else is around.
Apr 12 19:56:26 <yourfate>	kchibisov: I have ncurses installed, but afaik on freebsd termcap is used
Apr 12 19:56:28 <yourfate>	not terminfo
Apr 12 19:57:19 <yourfate>	I have not installed alacritty on the bsd machine
Apr 12 19:57:41 <yourfate>	I manually installed the terminfo as described on the alacritty gitlab page
Apr 12 19:58:00 <yourfate>	which didn't work, I created a termcap from it and put that in ~/.termcap
Apr 12 19:58:14 <yourfate>	which seems to work when I SSH to the machine, but once I start tmux on it I lose color
Apr 12 19:58:28 <yourfate>	if I first set TERM to xterm-256color everything is well
Apr 12 20:03:10 <nixpulvis>	kchibisov: I might have gotten somewhere with ~/.vim/after/syntax/syncolor.vim.
Apr 12 20:14:19 <kchibisov>	yourfate: does infocmp -x alacritty is working on your remote machine?
Apr 12 20:14:35 <kchibisov>	Also, FreeBSD is shipping our terminfo somewhere IIRC.
Apr 12 20:14:52 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: I have my custom theme, but it's not named, so it's not published.
Apr 12 20:14:56 <yourfate>	yes, that outputs stuff, but it ends prematurely I think
Apr 12 20:14:58 <kchibisov>	but it works in vim.
Apr 12 20:15:22 <yourfate>	#       Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /usr/local/share/misc/terminfo.db
Apr 12 20:15:24 <yourfate>	is the header
Apr 12 20:15:32 <yourfate>	I put that in the terminfo.db using tic I think
Apr 12 20:15:53 <kchibisov>	could you infocmp -d alacritty xterm-256color?
Apr 12 20:16:24 <yourfate>	output: https://bsd.to/QG03
Apr 12 20:17:01 <kchibisov>	it seems fine.
Apr 12 20:17:16 <kchibisov>	so again what's your color issues? like I don't see them in `ls`?
Apr 12 20:17:50 <yourfate>	I don't see any colours, my shell prompt, ls, neofetch
Apr 12 20:17:53 <yourfate>	etc
Apr 12 20:17:55 <yourfate>	everything white text
Apr 12 20:17:58 <yourfate>	in tmux
Apr 12 20:18:14 <kchibisov>	what is echo $TERM inside of tmux?
Apr 12 20:18:37 <yourfate>	I tried different things, alacritty, tmux-256color, screen-256color
Apr 12 20:18:44 <yourfate>	via tmux.conf
Apr 12 20:18:55 <yourfate>	to no avail
Apr 12 20:19:01 <kchibisov>	is `echo -e "\e[31mRED` is red?
Apr 12 20:20:01 <yourfate>	sec, my irc client garbled that
Apr 12 20:20:59 <yourfate>	no, just says RED in white
Apr 12 20:21:29 <kchibisov>	Oh, so tmux is completely broken.
Apr 12 20:21:39 <yourfate>	something is very weird there
Apr 12 20:21:54 <yourfate>	before I had the alacritty in .termcmp it would tell me it can't find the terminfo database
Apr 12 20:21:58 <yourfate>	when I tried to attach
Apr 12 20:22:02 <yourfate>	when term as alacritty
Apr 12 20:22:10 <yourfate>	but it worked with xterm-256color
Apr 12 20:22:29 <yourfate>	eh .termcap
Apr 12 20:22:37 <kchibisov>	have you tried that `set -g default-terminal tmux-256color` in tmux, right?
Apr 12 20:22:52 <yourfate>	yes
Apr 12 20:23:03 <yourfate>	I also tied that in addition to `set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc"`
Apr 12 20:23:10 <yourfate>	which I found somewhere
Apr 12 20:23:14 <yourfate>	no changes
Apr 12 20:23:29 <kchibisov>	it should be set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",alacritty:Tc"
Apr 12 20:23:29 <yourfate>	also tried with no config at all
Apr 12 20:24:00 <kchibisov>	but it's for truecolors, so..
Apr 12 20:24:05 <yourfate>	nope
Apr 12 20:24:56 <kchibisov>	and i'll assume `env TERM=xterm-256color tmux` works?
Apr 12 20:25:21 <yourfate>	yup
Apr 12 20:25:48 <kchibisov>	what tmux version are you using?
Apr 12 20:25:59 <yourfate>	3.0a
Apr 12 20:26:15 <yourfate>	i'm on freebsd 12.1
Apr 12 20:26:18 <yourfate>	installed like 2 days ago
Apr 12 20:26:24 <yourfate>	well, the machine is, I'm on arch
Apr 12 20:26:53 <kchibisov>	it's just random bsd issue, I guess.
Apr 12 20:27:06 <yourfate>	thanks for trying though!
Apr 12 20:27:15 <yourfate>	I guess I'll alias tmux :P
Apr 12 20:27:16 <kchibisov>	let me check tmux sources, since linux works fine.
Apr 12 20:27:51 <kchibisov>	tmux speaks about ncurses a lot, do you have it?
Apr 12 20:28:20 <yourfate>	I first had tmux, which worked, but needed to install the ncruses package to get tic
Apr 12 20:28:32 <yourfate>	I think there are 2 different ncurses on bsd?
Apr 12 20:28:43 <kchibisov>	Hm?
Apr 12 20:28:51 <yourfate>	I think tmux needs ncurses
Apr 12 20:28:55 <kchibisov>	BSD doesn't have ncurses at all by default.
Apr 12 20:29:05 <yourfate>	yes, but installing tmux should have installed it maybe?
Apr 12 20:29:10 <yourfate>	sed
Apr 12 20:29:13 <yourfate>	sec
Apr 12 20:31:26 <yourfate>	ok, idk, but I installed ncurses after tmux I think
Apr 12 20:31:35 <yourfate>	mainly because I wanted tic
Apr 12 20:31:44 <yourfate>	to install the alacritty terminfo :P
Apr 12 20:41:09 <kchibisov>	Could you run `tmux -v` and post some logs?
Apr 12 20:41:36 <yourfate>	where does that log?
Apr 12 20:42:30 <kchibisov>	it should create 2 files in a dir where you've started it.
Apr 12 20:42:38 <kchibisov>	I need server log.
Apr 12 20:43:47 <yourfate>	sec
Apr 12 20:45:26 <yourfate>	http://sprunge.us/nYGIMw
Apr 12 20:50:55 <kchibisov>	could you post similar output when TERM=xterm-256color?
Apr 12 20:53:00 <yourfate>	http://sprunge.us/UG786F
Apr 12 20:53:46 <yourfate>	I still had set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color" in there
Apr 12 20:53:49 <yourfate>	in tmux.conf
Apr 12 20:57:40 <kchibisov>	could you recompile our terminfo?
Apr 12 20:58:25 <yourfate>	as in, with tic?
Apr 12 20:58:47 <yourfate>	done
Apr 12 20:58:47 <kchibisov>	yeah, and in a way it's mentioned on our INSTALLATION.
Apr 12 20:58:58 <kchibisov>	yeah and logout + reconnect
Apr 12 20:59:33 <yourfate>	still the old situation
Apr 12 20:59:57 <kchibisov>	both terminfos, even xterm one seems broken.
Apr 12 21:00:25 <kchibisov>	I mean tmux reports that a lot of features are not presented/defined even in xterm terminfo.
Apr 12 21:00:48 <kchibisov>	but yeah, it says that `colors` missing in alacritty terminfo.
Apr 12 21:01:00 <kchibisov>	on linux it reports everything correctly
Apr 12 21:01:16 <yourfate>	maybe because I have the .termcap file?
Apr 12 21:01:19 <yourfate>	in home
Apr 12 21:01:29 <kchibisov>	could you remove it?
Apr 12 21:01:31 <yourfate>	but if I remove that tmux says it can't find the terminfo db
Apr 12 21:01:32 <yourfate>	sure, sec
Apr 12 21:02:01 <yourfate>	if I remove that I get `open terminal failed: can't find terminfo database`
Apr 12 21:02:06 <yourfate>	when trying to start tmux
Apr 12 21:03:58 <kchibisov>	Hm, I guess you're correct, also, I guess you should translate our terminfo to termcap.
Apr 12 21:04:32 <kchibisov>	Could you try to pass `-C` to tic?
Apr 12 21:05:54 <yourfate>	btw, if that .termcap is missing the shell is somewhat broken even before tmux, keybinds don't work, can't delete chars etc
Apr 12 21:05:57 <yourfate>	sec
Apr 12 21:08:28 <yourfate>	the output of the command from INSTALLATION, but with C added yelds: https://bsd.to/ymLG
Apr 12 21:08:34 <yourfate>	I tried that as .termcap before
Apr 12 21:08:49 <yourfate>	but it's missing the alacritty+common it references afaik
Apr 12 21:09:20 <yourfate>	I don't really know much about terminfo/cap though, I talked to people in freeBSD though
Apr 12 21:12:47 <yourfate>	# that is
Apr 12 21:14:30 <kchibisov>	Could you delete our terminfo and reinstall ncurses?
Apr 12 21:14:39 <kchibisov>	ncurses should have our terminfo.
Apr 12 21:18:06 <yourfate>	sec
Apr 12 21:18:13 <yourfate>	the terminfo.db you mean
Apr 12 21:18:27 <yourfate>	it uses the hashed db isntead of the individual files
Apr 12 21:18:28 <yourfate>	it seems
Apr 12 21:19:16 <kchibisov>	yeah, but it should install it, I guess.
Apr 12 21:24:40 <yourfate>	hmm
Apr 12 21:24:46 <yourfate>	now there is no terminfo.db
Apr 12 21:25:03 <yourfate>	in /usr/share/misc/
Apr 12 21:26:43 <yourfate>	ah, /usr/local/share/misc has it
Apr 12 21:29:45 <yourfate>	ye, ncurses seems to come with a terminfo
Apr 12 21:30:03 <kchibisov>	does it work though?
Apr 12 21:30:08 <yourfate>	I made sure the db was gone when I uninstalled it.
Apr 12 21:30:29 <yourfate>	nah, can't delete characters, and tmux can't find the database
Apr 12 21:30:46 <yourfate>	infocmp does tell me it has something
Apr 12 21:30:57 <kchibisov>	nah, I have no idea how FreeBSD works here.
Apr 12 21:31:04 <yourfate>	thanks for trying though!
Apr 12 21:31:07 <yourfate>	:D
Apr 12 21:31:23 <yourfate>	maybe it'll get fixed in the future, for now I'll just use xterm terminfo on that machine
Apr 12 21:31:35 <yourfate>	great terminal though, like it so far!
Apr 12 21:32:18 <yourfate>	if you for some reason have more thoughts on this ping me, i'll idle here :P
Apr 12 21:33:56 <kchibisov>	yeah, someone from bsd should explain how it works, I guess.
Apr 12 22:28:16 <kchibisov>	yourfate: do you see `colors#256` in infocmp -x?
Apr 12 22:29:44 <yourfate>	well, colors#0x100
Apr 12 22:29:48 <yourfate>	which should be the same
Apr 12 22:30:02 <kchibisov>	in both xterm and alacritty
Apr 12 22:30:05 <yourfate>	I do have color before i start tmux
Apr 12 22:30:10 <yourfate>	sec
Apr 12 22:30:44 <yourfate>	ye, xterm-256color also has colors#0x100
Apr 12 22:31:43 <kchibisov>	is .termcap some your local file?
Apr 12 22:32:03 <kchibisov>	or dir
Apr 12 22:33:44 <yourfate>	I currently have no .termcap in home
Apr 12 22:33:55 <yourfate>	i moved it to old.termcap for the test
Apr 12 22:33:59 <yourfate>	and still haven't moved it back
Apr 12 22:34:07 <kchibisov>	also, do you tmux kill-server ?
Apr 12 22:34:25 <kchibisov>	like it's not like some old tmux running.
Apr 12 22:34:30 <yourfate>	ye, I had a look in ps to see if tmux was off
Apr 12 22:34:56 <yourfate>	kill-server says no server running
Apr 12 22:35:05 <kchibisov>	Could you try TERM=alacritty tmux new and then tmux info|grep colors
Apr 12 22:35:19 <kchibisov>	with empty tmux config, please.
Apr 12 22:35:28 <kchibisov>	and the same for xterm-256color
Apr 12 22:36:57 <yourfate>	xterm:    9: colors: (number) 256
Apr 12 22:37:29 <yourfate>	ah, can't start tmux with alacitty term, as I removed my .termcap
Apr 12 22:37:42 <yourfate>	so it just says zsh: can't find terminal definition for alacritty
Apr 12 22:37:44 <yourfate>	open terminal failed: can't find terminfo database
Apr 12 22:37:56 <kchibisov>	Wait, could you explain where xterm-256color is on FreeBSD?
Apr 12 22:39:12 <kchibisov>	on linux it's in /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm-256color
Apr 12 22:39:25 <yourfate>	there are 3 places I think, there is /usr/share/misc/termcap, /usr/share/misc/termcap.db and /usr/local/share/misc/terminfo.db
Apr 12 22:39:38 <yourfate>	thermcap is also a file
Apr 12 22:39:53 <yourfate>	there are no folders for terminfo or termcap from what I can see
Apr 12 22:40:50 <kchibisov>	Oh, so you should have xterm inside of this thing and when you install alacritty you have to make a custom termcap db
Apr 12 22:41:03 <kchibisov>	right?
Apr 12 22:41:30 <yourfate>	I think alacritty's terminfo is in the /usr/loca/share/misc/terminfo.db
Apr 12 22:41:35 <yourfate>	and I can convert that to termcap format
Apr 12 22:41:38 <yourfate>	and put that in my homedir
Apr 12 22:41:43 <yourfate>	then I can start tmux
Apr 12 22:41:55 <yourfate>	but have no color in tmux
Apr 12 22:42:07 <yourfate>	I think what might be happening is that the system uses the terminfo.db
Apr 12 22:42:09 <yourfate>	as it has color
Apr 12 22:42:13 <yourfate>	but tmux somehow doesn't?
Apr 12 22:42:20 <kchibisov>	do you have strace?
Apr 12 22:43:07 <yourfate>	I shall get it, sec
Apr 12 22:44:19 <kchibisov>	Could you try tic with  -c -r in addition?
Apr 12 22:44:42 <yourfate>	apparently, there is no strace on freebsd, there is truss()
Apr 12 22:45:03 <kchibisov>	Also, if you remove our terminfo entirely from the system does BSD has it?
Apr 12 22:45:14 <kchibisov>	like by default tmux is the only problem right?
Apr 12 22:45:46 <yourfate>	no, there is some problem with keys too, like when I to del it instead inserts a space, and arrow keys have problems too
Apr 12 22:45:50 <yourfate>	that might be shell related though idk
Apr 12 22:46:10 <yourfate>	that is if I'm using TERM=alacritty
Apr 12 22:46:22 <kchibisov>	so BSD doesn't have it at all then.
Apr 12 22:46:26 <yourfate>	it has
Apr 12 22:46:31 <yourfate>	if I remove every manual terminfo
Apr 12 22:46:38 <yourfate>	and connect with TERM=alacritty
Apr 12 22:46:42 <kchibisov>	And why it doesn't work?
Apr 12 22:46:43 <yourfate>	I have colors, but broken keys, but
Apr 12 22:46:58 <kchibisov>	broken keys is a result of missing terminfo most of the time.
Apr 12 22:47:04 <yourfate>	infocmp outputs stuff
Apr 12 22:47:08 <yourfate>	related to alacritty
Apr 12 22:47:15 <yourfate>	and says it has it from the terminfo.db
Apr 12 22:47:19 <yourfate>	which comes with ncurses
Apr 12 22:47:51 <kchibisov>	this is so strange.
Apr 12 22:48:14 <kchibisov>	I'd recommend to understand how to compile it with termcap.
Apr 12 22:48:43 <kchibisov>	Also, run this command with sudo.
Apr 12 22:48:49 <kchibisov>	I mean `tic`.
Apr 12 22:48:51 <kchibisov>	without*
Apr 12 22:49:04 <yourfate>	sorry?
Apr 12 22:49:56 <kchibisov>	tic -xe -c -r -K alacritty,alacritty-direct extra/alacritty.info
Apr 12 22:50:16 <yourfate>	it did something
Apr 12 22:50:19 <yourfate>	:P
Apr 12 22:50:21 <yourfate>	no output though
Apr 12 22:50:31 <kchibisov>	it should install terminfo for user
Apr 12 22:50:38 <kchibisov>	does tmux works?
Apr 12 22:51:17 <yourfate>	wtf, sec, now alacritty won't start on my linux
Apr 12 22:51:20 <yourfate>	wtf
Apr 12 22:51:39 <yourfate>	oh, I did a system update on linux in the meantime, maybe I need a reboot
Apr 12 22:51:55 <kchibisov>	what it outputs yourfate ?
Apr 12 22:52:01 <kchibisov>	I mean on linux.
Apr 12 22:52:01 <yourfate>	        Error creating GL context; Received multiple errors. Errors: `[OsError("eglInitialize failed"), OsError("GL context creation failed")]`
Apr 12 22:52:08 <kchibisov>	driver update?
Apr 12 22:52:11 <yourfate>	probably
Apr 12 22:52:13 <yourfate>	lots of updates
Apr 12 22:52:14 <yourfate>	sec, reboot
Apr 12 22:57:55 <yourfate>	no, doesn't work. keys still broken, tmux can't find the database
Apr 12 22:59:44 <kchibisov>	does keys broken outside of tmux as well?
Apr 12 23:01:12 <yourfate>	well, yes, can't get into tmux as it won't start without a terminfo, keys broken outside of it
Apr 12 23:01:32 <kchibisov>	does keys broken with other terminfo?
Apr 12 23:01:43 <yourfate>	no, xterm-256color it's ifne
Apr 12 23:01:52 <yourfate>	and tmux works
Apr 12 23:01:57 <kchibisov>	let me run my BSD.
Apr 12 23:02:02 <yourfate>	:D
Apr 12 23:02:13 <yourfate>	myabe it's different if alacritty is installed on the BSD
Apr 12 23:02:19 <yourfate>	but I bet that needs x11
Apr 12 23:02:28 <kchibisov>	it's some BSD bs tbh, since our terminfo is just copy pasta of xterm.
Apr 12 23:02:28 <yourfate>	which is not on that machine and I don't plan to have that there
Apr 12 23:02:42 <kchibisov>	we require only libxcb to built
Apr 12 23:02:48 <yourfate>	ye, i bet it's some Bs with them still using termcap usually
Apr 12 23:03:00 <kchibisov>	let me start my bsd sec
Apr 12 23:03:33 <yourfate>	right, I can isntall the alcaritty package, without any dependencies
Apr 12 23:03:58 <yourfate>	that didn't fix anything :P
Apr 12 23:04:16 <kchibisov>	ofc it won't fix anything.
Apr 12 23:04:28 <yourfate>	idk I thought maybe the port packages a termcap or something
Apr 12 23:05:58 <kchibisov>	god, bsd.
Apr 12 23:06:57 <yourfate>	not a fan?
Apr 12 23:07:31 <yourfate>	I'm new to it, but I thought it might make for a better server os than arch
Apr 12 23:07:43 <yourfate>	not that I really had problems with arch on a server
Apr 12 23:07:56 <yourfate>	just watned to give that a try b/c why not :P
Apr 12 23:08:15 <kchibisov>	let me understand why my ssh is broken on it.
Apr 12 23:09:10 <yourfate>	client or server?
Apr 12 23:09:23 <kchibisov>	I have no idea which one.
Apr 12 23:24:20 <kchibisov>	Ok, let me see.
Apr 12 23:24:39 <kchibisov>	seems like identical problem, but I can delete with backspace at least
Apr 12 23:26:21 <yourfate>	at least it's not something I messed up somehow. would have felt bald wasting all that time with some dumb mistake :P
Apr 12 23:26:27 <yourfate>	*bad
Apr 12 23:26:40 <kchibisov>	I mean xterm-256color is broken as well.
Apr 12 23:26:57 <kchibisov>	like you can lauch somthing but a lot of features of it are just disabled
Apr 12 23:27:17 <yourfate>	maybe because termcap is limited to I think 1023 bytes or something?
Apr 12 23:28:02 <kchibisov>	How to install packages on this thing?
Apr 12 23:28:09 <yourfate>	pkg install bla
Apr 12 23:28:43 <yourfate>	or go to /usr/ports and compile them
Apr 12 23:40:20 <yourfate>	headed to bed, I'll check back tomorrow to see if there were any new insights :P have fun
Apr 13 00:00:05 <kchibisov>	it seems like I've figured out
Apr 13 00:02:15 <basic>	now that i removed my default bindings, i can't copy paste anymore
Apr 13 00:02:20 <basic>	is that to be expected?
Apr 13 00:02:30 <kchibisov>	you should be able to copy paste just fine.
Apr 13 00:02:44 <kchibisov>	All copy paste bindings are builtin.
Apr 13 00:02:46 <basic>	with ctrl+shift+v right?
Apr 13 00:02:53 <kchibisov>	yes
Apr 13 00:02:54 <basic>	hm
Apr 13 00:02:57 <basic>	*test*
Apr 13 00:03:08 <basic>	kchibi
Apr 13 00:03:08 <basic>	basic>
Apr 13 00:03:10 <basic>	sorry
Apr 13 00:03:13 <basic>	hm, weird
Apr 13 00:03:25 <kchibisov>	Also, if you can have custom key bindings just fine.
Apr 13 00:03:29 <kchibisov>	s/if/
Apr 13 00:03:38 <basic>	yeah looks like vim isn't able to save to clipboard
Apr 13 00:03:57 <kchibisov>	Are you using "+" buffer?
Apr 13 00:04:16 <kchibisov>	unnamedplus, etc.
Apr 13 00:04:46 <basic>	yes, i guess it's because gvim isn't installeed
Apr 13 00:05:02 <kchibisov>	no, vim clipboard doesn't use escape sequence to set clipboard.
Apr 13 00:05:15 <kchibisov>	So vim is using xclip like software to write to a clipboard.
Apr 13 00:05:18 <kchibisov>	or tmux.
Apr 13 00:05:49 <basic>	yeah, i had this problem already it's weird
Apr 13 00:06:03 <basic>	i compiled it with xsupport, that alone doesn't fix it
Apr 13 00:06:07 <basic>	i need gvim
Apr 13 00:06:08 <kchibisov>	Like it's not alacritty problem, it's vim that should implement OSC 52
Apr 13 00:06:14 <kchibisov>	no, you don't need X support
Apr 13 00:06:24 <basic>	well, it fixes it :/
Apr 13 00:06:35 <kchibisov>	Oh, maybe it has some weird code to do that.
Apr 13 00:06:40 <basic>	yeah but not a alacritty problem
Apr 13 01:06:55 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: are you around?
Apr 13 01:08:23 <kchibisov>	How custom layouts like dvorak works with key bindings on various systems.
Apr 13 01:08:55 <kchibisov>	Do you usually have QWERTY bindings or custom dvorak bindings by default.
Apr 13 01:09:54 <kchibisov>	and how it works on let's say macOS.
Apr 13 01:27:02 <UndeadLeech>	Now I am.
Apr 13 01:27:15 <UndeadLeech>	I just use dvorak with default bindings everywhere.
Apr 13 01:27:30 <UndeadLeech>	But I use i3 which doesn't really have "default bindings" and a custom WM in macOS too.
Apr 13 01:27:42 <UndeadLeech>	But for stuff like vim I use default, which I would strongly recommend.
Apr 13 01:27:42 <kchibisov>	Are they based on QWERTY or dvorak.
Apr 13 01:27:51 <UndeadLeech>	I tried remapping, but it just doesn't work well.
Apr 13 01:28:01 <UndeadLeech>	They're mostly based on vi, so QWERTY.
Apr 13 01:28:12 <UndeadLeech>	But vi bindings work pretty well with dvorak once you get used to them tbh.
Apr 13 01:28:26 <kchibisov>	I'm qurious on how winit should handle such things.
Apr 13 01:28:30 <kchibisov>	and what it should provide
Apr 13 01:28:42 <kchibisov>	I'm not interested in dvorak :- )
Apr 13 01:28:58 <UndeadLeech>	I mean my keyboard reports as us layout. :P
Apr 13 01:29:17 <UndeadLeech>	Though on macOS it reports as dvorak, since I often use the trash built-in one there.
Apr 13 01:29:34 <UndeadLeech>	Since I have only one and that one doesn't have usb-c.
Apr 13 01:30:16 <UndeadLeech>	I mean dvorak is fairly uncomplicated, since all base keys are the same as on qwerty I think.
Apr 13 01:30:28 <UndeadLeech>	Problematic is something like german qwertz for example, where you have actually different keys.
Apr 13 01:31:13 <UndeadLeech>	Like it has a +/* key, instead of a =/+ one. So you'll get a different base key.
Apr 13 01:31:20 <kchibisov>	My concern is that if we go full keysyms which is very good for dvorak support, I wonder what should we do about Russian layout, etc.
Apr 13 01:31:33 <UndeadLeech>	Dvorak really shouldn't be a problem tbh.
Apr 13 01:31:41 <kchibisov>	yeah, it's not a problem.
Apr 13 01:31:47 <kchibisov>	Russian layout is a problem.
Apr 13 01:31:57 <UndeadLeech>	Like for dvorak all keys are identical, they're just in different locations.
Apr 13 01:32:03 <UndeadLeech>	The keymap takes care of that.
Apr 13 01:32:11 <UndeadLeech>	But russian/german/french/whatever, that's problematic.
Apr 13 01:32:46 <UndeadLeech>	I think I said this on the winit tracker before, but I believe the base key should always be reported regardless of shift state.
Apr 13 01:32:55 <kchibisov>	yeah, my question is whether concept like reporting keys based on scancodes in addition to virtual key codes is nice.
Apr 13 01:33:11 <UndeadLeech>	Then in Alacritty for bindings like IncreaseFontSize, we should bind to `ReceivedChar('+')`, not a key.
Apr 13 01:33:34 <UndeadLeech>	Scancodes are already reported, right? Or what do you mean?
Apr 13 01:34:41 <kchibisov>	I mean that you'll have { scancode: 38, raw_code: Some(Code::F), virtual_key_code: Some(VCode::RussianA)"}
Apr 13 01:34:49 <kchibisov>	so you can bind either by vcode or by raw_code.
Apr 13 01:35:20 <kchibisov>	and in case of vcode you can have per layout bindings, but bindings by raw_code could be good for games, etc.
Apr 13 01:35:49 <UndeadLeech>	Where does that raw_code come from?
Apr 13 01:35:58 <kchibisov>	it's based off scancode.
Apr 13 01:36:04 <UndeadLeech>	The us binding of that scancode?
Apr 13 01:36:07 <kchibisov>	yes.
Apr 13 01:36:23 <UndeadLeech>	How does that work, is that based on key location?
Apr 13 01:36:36 <kchibisov>	it's not dvorak, etc aware.
Apr 13 01:36:40 <kchibisov>	it's just direct mapping.
Apr 13 01:37:14 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think that's ever a good idea tbh.
Apr 13 01:37:15 <kchibisov>	Like you can have QWERTY bindings regardless of using dvorak/Russian bindings.
Apr 13 01:37:27 <kchibisov>	I use such thing in sway, without it it's hard to use for me.
Apr 13 01:37:39 <UndeadLeech>	Because that's exactly what you don't want to do. You don't want to map to a key location, but to a key value.
Apr 13 01:37:56 <kchibisov>	I mean that you have an option.
Apr 13 01:38:17 <kchibisov>	you either use location based or value based bindings.
Apr 13 01:38:25 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see a scenario where we'd ever want that tbh.
Apr 13 01:38:27 <kchibisov>	and Vcode is value based, but raw code location based.
Apr 13 01:38:29 <UndeadLeech>	Like in our default bindings.
Apr 13 01:38:42 <UndeadLeech>	Like it makes no sense to the user.
Apr 13 01:38:53 <kchibisov>	In our default bindings we don't need them, but in general we need them.
Apr 13 01:39:07 <UndeadLeech>	I don't even have a staggered keyboard layout for example, it makes absolutely zero sense on my keyboard where each scancode is located.
Apr 13 01:39:13 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think we do.
Apr 13 01:39:20 <UndeadLeech>	What benefit does this provide over just scancodes?
Apr 13 01:39:31 <kchibisov>	cross platform way?
Apr 13 01:39:42 <UndeadLeech>	Scancodes work on all platforms?
Apr 13 01:39:49 <kchibisov>	yes.
Apr 13 01:40:05 <UndeadLeech>	So what's the problem?
Apr 13 01:40:15 <kchibisov>	User should match numbers instead of good enum values.
Apr 13 01:40:39 <kchibisov>	and each platform has different numbers.
Apr 13 01:40:41 <kchibisov>	IIRC.
Apr 13 01:40:42 <UndeadLeech>	The enum values make absolutely no sense though for someone who isn't using qwerty.
Apr 13 01:40:50 <UndeadLeech>	How the hell would I know where my qwerty keys are?
Apr 13 01:41:36 <kchibisov>	The problem is that you're assuming US + QWERTY, when I'm talking about this thing.
Apr 13 01:41:58 <kchibisov>	However my problem is Russian + QWERTY.
Apr 13 01:42:13 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see what you mean.
Apr 13 01:42:32 <kchibisov>	If I change my layout to Russian, I can't paste into alacritty.
Apr 13 01:42:46 <kchibisov>	like I just can't do that.
Apr 13 01:42:55 <UndeadLeech>	Because the `V` key doesn't exist?
Apr 13 01:43:00 <kchibisov>	yes
Apr 13 01:43:05 <UndeadLeech>	Then bind to scancode?
Apr 13 01:43:22 <kchibisov>	But then I change to macOS and got the same problem
Apr 13 01:43:25 <kchibisov>	with different scancode.
Apr 13 01:43:39 <kchibisov>	so it's just a good way to abstract scancode bindings.
Apr 13 01:43:52 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think it is at all.
Apr 13 01:44:04 <UndeadLeech>	It just binds to an arbitrary intermediate state that is completely confusing.
Apr 13 01:44:17 <kchibisov>	it binds to scancode.
Apr 13 01:44:27 <kchibisov>	but it just has some name, which makes sense.
Apr 13 01:44:31 <UndeadLeech>	No, you bind scancode to qwerty.
Apr 13 01:44:34 <kchibisov>	instead of 0xfffff
Apr 13 01:44:55 <kchibisov>	yes, but I want to bind to location.
Apr 13 01:45:02 <kchibisov>	since there's not dvorak(russian) IIRC.
Apr 13 01:45:06 <kchibisov>	s/not/no
Apr 13 01:45:21 <kchibisov>	You want to bind to location anyway.
Apr 13 01:45:24 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think that's a good idea at all tbh.
Apr 13 01:45:32 <kchibisov>	scancode binding is a binding to location.
Apr 13 01:45:43 <UndeadLeech>	Having to lookup the qwerty value of your key to map it just sounds stupid.
Apr 13 01:46:01 <kchibisov>	it's not value, winit will just send you Raw(A).
Apr 13 01:46:12 <UndeadLeech>	It's just another thing to confuse people that now have a million different ways to bind the same thing, with no clear indication of which thing is the correct thing.
Apr 13 01:46:44 <kchibisov>	I'm just saying that bindings doens't work well, and in expected way for multilayout.
Apr 13 01:46:46 <UndeadLeech>	And if you have keyboards like mine, you can't even map by location at all, it'll just give you back complete garbage.
Apr 13 01:47:02 <kchibisov>	scancode is shitty solution, since it's just an arbitrary number which I should just guess.
Apr 13 01:47:15 <UndeadLeech>	Because my us F is at dvorak F location, not at US F.
Apr 13 01:47:29 <UndeadLeech>	So then I switch my keyboard and nothing works, just how you switch your layout and nothing works.
Apr 13 01:47:31 <UndeadLeech>	Same shit.
Apr 13 01:47:33 <kchibisov>	if you have hardware dvorak it'll remap.
Apr 13 01:47:43 <kchibisov>	I have a keyboard with hardware dvorak.
Apr 13 01:47:56 <kchibisov>	I don't set dvorak layout at all for it.
Apr 13 01:48:03 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah exactly.
Apr 13 01:48:05 <kchibisov>	it just works with qwerty.
Apr 13 01:48:11 <UndeadLeech>	Which will run into the same problem as you have when switching layouts.
Apr 13 01:48:15 <kchibisov>	because it chagnes scancodes.
Apr 13 01:48:26 <UndeadLeech>	Because suddenly your key is at a different location with a software dvorak keyboard.
Apr 13 01:48:27 <kchibisov>	so your scancodes will be chaged as well, and you'll have correct bidnings.
Apr 13 01:48:57 <UndeadLeech>	I just don't see how this simplifies anything.
Apr 13 01:49:06 <UndeadLeech>	It just adds another thing, bloating everything up.
Apr 13 01:49:18 <kchibisov>	but scancode binding has the same flow.
Apr 13 01:49:34 <UndeadLeech>	So why the hell do we need another thing, if scancode already does it?
Apr 13 01:49:39 <kchibisov>	but you should guess what this shit is instead of just binding to a location.
Apr 13 01:49:55 <kchibisov>	and on other platform you'll have different shit.
Apr 13 01:50:02 <UndeadLeech>	You assume that I would know the qwerty location.
Apr 13 01:50:25 <UndeadLeech>	Qwerty names are just as arbitrary as scancodes, with the nice benefit of being extremely confusing.
Apr 13 01:50:25 <kchibisov>	I assume that you'd know location on your keyboard hardware layout.
Apr 13 01:50:38 <UndeadLeech>	Which most people that do not actually use qwerty won't know.
Apr 13 01:50:50 <kchibisov>	if you're using qwerty keyboard with software dvorak you don't have any problems.
Apr 13 01:51:02 <kchibisov>	because this keyboard is qwerty, and you can just look at it.
Apr 13 01:51:13 <UndeadLeech>	If I use qwertz or hardware dvorak I will.
Apr 13 01:51:15 <kchibisov>	and if you hardware dvorak, you've binded to hardware dvorak.
Apr 13 01:51:50 <kchibisov>	So in hardware dvorak, you'll have a completely different location.
Apr 13 01:52:01 <kchibisov>	because your scancode is in completely different location.
Apr 13 01:52:08 <UndeadLeech>	Also what if there is no qwerty key? Need to use scancodes anyways.
Apr 13 01:52:37 <kchibisov>	I'm saying that binding by scancode doesn't work well for the end users.
Apr 13 01:53:00 <kchibisov>	keysym is fine, but if you want binding that works regardless of layout it won't work.
Apr 13 01:53:02 <UndeadLeech>	Why not?
Apr 13 01:53:53 <kchibisov>	Because end users don't know how to obtain scancodes, but it can obtain location of char on his keyboard.
Apr 13 01:53:59 <UndeadLeech>	How?
Apr 13 01:54:10 <kchibisov>	Just look at the keyboard?
Apr 13 01:54:18 <UndeadLeech>	Only because you use a qwerty keyboard.
Apr 13 01:54:21 <kchibisov>	on a keycap.
Apr 13 01:54:25 <UndeadLeech>	That won't help a large chunk of users that don't.
Apr 13 01:54:42 <kchibisov>	if you use software dvorak you have qwerty keyboard.
Apr 13 01:54:46 <UndeadLeech>	No.
Apr 13 01:54:49 <UndeadLeech>	That's not true.
Apr 13 01:54:57 <kchibisov>	unless you swapped all the key caps.
Apr 13 01:55:04 <kchibisov>	which is like 0.01% users.
Apr 13 01:55:08 <UndeadLeech>	Except for my hardware dvorak keyboard, I do not own a single qwerty keyboard.
Apr 13 01:55:28 <kchibisov>	your hardware dvorak keyboard will work fine, since it's not based on QWERTY
Apr 13 01:55:59 <kchibisov>	So Raw keys will match your keysyms on your keyboard.
Apr 13 01:56:00 <UndeadLeech>	My hardware dvorak will work fine, because it's qwerty and they're identical.
Apr 13 01:56:03 <UndeadLeech>	But none of my others will.
Apr 13 01:56:34 <UndeadLeech>	On MacOS I have a qwertz keyboard with software dvorak for example.
Apr 13 01:56:37 <kchibisov>	I'm saying that only software layouts could behave differently.
Apr 13 01:56:39 <UndeadLeech>	Now you're adding qwerty to that.
Apr 13 01:56:51 <UndeadLeech>	So you're asking me to check the qwerty location on my qwertz keyboard which uses dvorak.
Apr 13 01:56:52 <kchibisov>	How macOS default bindings are working on macOS?
Apr 13 01:56:53 <UndeadLeech>	That's stupid.
Apr 13 01:57:02 <kchibisov>	no, it'll be based on qwertz
Apr 13 01:57:08 <kchibisov>	not on qwerty.
Apr 13 01:57:21 <kchibisov>	it's based on hardware layout, not on QWERTY.
Apr 13 01:57:28 <UndeadLeech>	You said you always want to bind to qwerty though, not qwertz, right?
Apr 13 01:57:35 <UndeadLeech>	Gotcha.
Apr 13 01:57:39 <kchibisov>	I said that I want to name scancodes.
Apr 13 01:57:50 <UndeadLeech>	Then it won't work between any of my keyboards, nice.
Apr 13 01:58:04 <kchibisov>	no, because scancodes are floating.
Apr 13 01:58:14 <UndeadLeech>	Because macOS qwertz is different than normal qwertz which is different than my qwerty hardware dvorak.
Apr 13 01:58:38 <kchibisov>	So do you have Command + C working on macOS?
Apr 13 01:58:46 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah of course, works just fine.
Apr 13 01:58:49 <UndeadLeech>	Why wouldn't it?
Apr 13 01:58:55 <kchibisov>	and where this `C` is?
Apr 13 01:59:07 <kchibisov>	on your dvorak layout or on qwertz
Apr 13 02:00:02 <kchibisov>	and if you switch layout to e.g. French will it have the same physical position?
Apr 13 02:00:47 <kchibisov>	I just want to understand how this thing is supposed to work.
Apr 13 02:01:00 <kchibisov>	And how some systems are handling such thing.
Apr 13 02:03:01 <kchibisov>	But literally every app can do such thing just fine without requiring me to define scancode bindnigs.
Apr 13 02:03:40 <kchibisov>	I mean paste from Russian layout.
Apr 13 02:06:24 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not familiar with how layouts work that are entirely different.
Apr 13 02:07:23 <kchibisov>	So I wonder how this problem should be solved, I feel like the majority is using Scancode like things for bindings.
Apr 13 02:14:11 *	kchibisov tried to test dvorak and spend 5 minutes to just reload sway.
Apr 13 02:15:56 <kchibisov>	It's interesting actually.
Apr 13 02:16:26 <kchibisov>	GTK is using dvorak layout for bindings in Russian layout.
Apr 13 02:16:36 <kchibisov>	and it's software dvorak.
Apr 13 02:17:30 <kchibisov>	so if you have 3 layouts, us,us(dvorak),ru it'll use QWERTY,Dvorak,Dvorak.
Apr 13 02:17:33 <kchibisov>	for bindnigs.
Apr 13 02:18:00 <UndeadLeech>	I found a bug.
Apr 13 02:18:08 <kchibisov>	where?
Apr 13 02:18:23 <UndeadLeech>	Our rotation doesn't work correctly. Escape `CSI Ps T`.
Apr 13 02:19:49 <kchibisov>	and sway uses Dvorak bindings as well in QWERTY layout if I do --bind-to-code.
Apr 13 02:20:17 <kchibisov>	this is just pure madness.
Apr 13 02:28:36 <UndeadLeech>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3582
Apr 13 02:28:41 <UndeadLeech>	I can't believe I've never noticed that.
Apr 13 02:28:45 <UndeadLeech>	This is pretty borked.
Apr 13 02:37:33 <UndeadLeech>	Also I think my reflow implementation might be functionally finished.
Apr 13 02:37:41 <UndeadLeech>	I'll have to do a ton of testing though.
Apr 13 02:37:50 <UndeadLeech>	And there's two dozen TODOs left.
Apr 13 02:41:24 <kchibisov>	If I understand the thing correctly, you bind to a physical location based on keymap.
Apr 13 02:43:15 <UndeadLeech>	How would that work though, do they check if the key exists on your keymap and then choose fallback if it doesn't?
Apr 13 02:43:19 <UndeadLeech>	Like if ctrl+c just works with software dvorak and russian.
Apr 13 02:43:39 <UndeadLeech>	Because on software dvorak it obviously should be at dvorak `c` location.
Apr 13 02:43:40 <kchibisov>	So you iterate all configured keymaps and collect their keysyms and bind to code in the end, if you requested to bind by code.
Apr 13 02:44:13 <kchibisov>	And on russian keyboard it's not a place for software dvorak.
Apr 13 02:45:37 <kchibisov>	I mean it's not on QWERTY place when you use --bind-to-code, but on software dvorak C position, as well as other bindings.
Apr 13 02:46:36 <UndeadLeech>	You said that other applications just handle it without having to configure anything though, right?
Apr 13 02:46:43 <kchibisov>	right.
Apr 13 02:46:49 <kchibisov>	I want the same in alacritty.
Apr 13 02:47:00 <UndeadLeech>	That would require a more complicated solution then though.
Apr 13 02:47:19 <kchibisov>	yeah, and such thing is costly.
Apr 13 02:47:26 <UndeadLeech>	Since software dvorak on a qwerty keyboard shouldn't have it at the qwerty location. But software russian on qwerty keyboard should?
Apr 13 02:47:37 <UndeadLeech>	Seems like a mess to me. Just force everyone to use qwerty.
Apr 13 02:48:01 <kchibisov>	I mean software russian has it on dvorak location.

Apr 17 16:48:20 <basic>	as soon as i have opacity activated in alacritty
Apr 17 16:48:27 <basic>	i observe some sort of "border" inside windows
Apr 17 16:48:37 <kchibisov>	Could you screenshot it?>
Apr 17 16:48:44 <basic>	it's really faint, i might not be able to screenshot it
Apr 17 16:48:51 <basic>	im sure i wouldn't see it on another monitor
Apr 17 16:48:58 <basic>	(because this one is expensive af)
Apr 17 16:49:01 <basic>	i try to screenshot
Apr 17 16:49:33 <basic>	https://paste.pics/71f76ca131c03e52c2fa1435f10fd5ae
Apr 17 16:49:41 <basic>	it's very visible
Apr 17 16:50:00 <basic>	(top and left edge)
Apr 17 16:50:24 <basic>	the floating shell window shows that it's not something that "shrines through"
Apr 17 16:50:29 <basic>	while that would be a weird shape either way
Apr 17 16:50:53 <basic>	it could be compton, tho
Apr 17 16:50:55 <kchibisov>	I see it, indeed.
Apr 17 16:51:06 <kchibisov>	I can't repro ofc.
Apr 17 16:51:15 <basic>	compton running?
Apr 17 16:51:20 <kchibisov>	I don't have X11.
Apr 17 16:51:23 <basic>	hm
Apr 17 16:51:45 <kchibisov>	Could it be shadows from compton?
Apr 17 16:51:56 <basic>	oh interesting
Apr 17 16:52:35 <basic>	yeah it's shadows
Apr 17 16:52:38 <basic>	:) thanks
Apr 17 16:53:06 <basic>	but why is everythings brighterr now
Apr 17 16:53:08 <basic>	wwhen startet
Apr 17 16:53:08 <basic>	hm
Apr 17 16:54:01 <basic>	well the answer is also shadow >.<
Apr 17 17:20:13 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: amazing selection reflow, it discovered Wayland clipboard bug.
Apr 17 18:36:43 <nimbius>	anyone using noto fonts? im getting weird spacing issues.
Apr 17 18:37:10 <kchibisov>	make sure to type it coloreclty in config and ensure that it's a monospace font.
Apr 17 18:38:20 <nimbius>	same issue if i switch to mono
Apr 17 18:40:47 <nimbius>	hm
Apr 17 18:40:53 <nimbius>	nevermind, retyped and now it works?
Apr 17 18:42:17 <nimbius>	do all fonts have to be monospace?
Apr 17 18:45:35 <cole-h>	If you want them to look nice in a terminal
Apr 17 18:46:58 <nimbius>	hm
Apr 17 18:47:08 <nimbius>	im guessing alacritty is somehow different than gnome-terminal?
Apr 17 18:48:59 <kchibisov>	ofc, it's a different terminal.
Apr 17 18:49:15 <kchibisov>	but I don't know any terminal supporting proportional fonts.
Apr 17 18:49:33 <kchibisov>	Like we can draw them, sure, but they won't look good.
Apr 17 18:49:45 <kchibisov>	So you need monospace fonts.
Apr 17 18:49:56 <kchibisov>	e.g. DejaVu Sans Mono, Roboto Mono,
Apr 17 18:51:54 <nimbius>	interesting.
Apr 17 18:52:48 <nimbius>	maybe Noto isnt the best monospace font then.
Apr 17 18:53:16 <kchibisov>	there's Noto Mono
Apr 17 18:53:41 <kchibisov>	just try `fc-list | grep -i "noto.*mono"`
Apr 17 18:53:45 <nimbius>	correct...
Apr 17 18:53:51 <kchibisov>	you'll likely find out something.
Apr 17 18:54:16 <kchibisov>	note, if you see suffix CJK, that's not what you want.
Apr 17 18:54:37 <nimbius>	i guess noto is a step up from inconsolata
Apr 17 18:55:55 <nimbius>	rendering weird utf characters however is something different i guess.
Apr 17 19:12:58 <nimbius>	iosevka is a nice font
Apr 17 19:17:53 <nimbius>	thanks kchibisov  :)
Apr 17 20:32:58 <candy>	Hi
Apr 17 20:33:06 <kchibisov>	Hi.
Apr 17 20:33:07 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Huh, really? What bug is it?
Apr 17 20:33:12 <candy>	how can i make new tab in alacritty?
Apr 17 20:33:19 <UndeadLeech>	You can't.
Apr 17 20:33:31 <candy>	ru sure?
Apr 17 20:33:37 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: there's some strange limit for 64KB, etc.
Apr 17 20:33:49 <kchibisov>	will be fixed at some point, but it was funny.
Apr 17 20:34:19 <UndeadLeech>	candy: I'm relatively certain that I haven't accidentally implemented this, yes.
Apr 17 20:34:27 <kchibisov>	Also, I feel like selection expansion on paste shouldn't be a thing.
Apr 17 20:34:42 <UndeadLeech>	Selection expansion on paste?
Apr 17 20:34:50 <candy>	i thinking about moving from lxterminal to alacritty, what you think about?
Apr 17 20:34:53 <kchibisov>	just try `cat`, paste something, select it, and continue to paste with mouse.
Apr 17 20:35:08 <kchibisov>	selection will be growing.
Apr 17 20:35:51 <UndeadLeech>	Oh yeah of course, selection expansion has always been a thing done on rendering, not on select.
Apr 17 20:36:03 <UndeadLeech>	Though it always has been questioned.
Apr 17 20:37:03 <kchibisov>	I wonder why it happens now.
Apr 17 20:37:41 <UndeadLeech>	It always was a problem with stuff like weechat, where we didn't have properly working rotation.
Apr 17 20:37:46 <candy>	can i change the colors of hostname etc?
Apr 17 20:37:57 <kchibisov>	it's done in your shell.
Apr 17 20:38:02 <UndeadLeech>	That's a shell, not a terminal thing candy. So yes you can.
Apr 17 20:38:03 <kchibisov>	we have nothing to do with that.
Apr 17 20:38:10 <candy>	that's a terminal thing
Apr 17 20:38:14 <kchibisov>	no.
Apr 17 20:38:33 <candy>	yes, it's different than all my other terminals
Apr 17 20:38:44 <kchibisov>	echo -e "\e[31mHOME\e[0m" is red
Apr 17 20:38:48 <kchibisov>	that's how coloring is done.
Apr 17 20:39:14 <candy>	yea i know
Apr 17 20:39:23 <candy>	but something just different in it
Apr 17 20:39:30 <kchibisov>	you can have system configuration to color hostname.
Apr 17 20:39:38 <kchibisov>	based on e.g. terminfo name.
Apr 17 20:39:51 <candy>	LOL , i try to explain
Apr 17 20:40:08 <kchibisov>	I try to answer how it is.
Apr 17 20:40:18 <candy>	i know what you talking about, i talking about different thing
Apr 17 20:40:38 <candy>	the gui is weird
Apr 17 20:40:42 <kchibisov>	ok, what thing are you talking about?
Apr 17 20:40:56 <kchibisov>	what gui?
Apr 17 20:41:24 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure that we have any, besides the terminal content.
Apr 17 20:41:53 <kchibisov>	if you can screenshot that gui, it could help.
Apr 17 20:42:04 <candy>	https://ibb.co/0M8q3s1
Apr 17 20:42:08 <candy>	see that picture
Apr 17 20:42:21 <kchibisov>	yeah, it's your shell.
Apr 17 20:42:31 <kchibisov>	green and blue.
Apr 17 20:42:48 <kchibisov>	you can change colors in config if you don't like them.
Apr 17 20:43:36 <kchibisov>	But you should ask, `my green color is weird`, since we have no clue what color your hostname is using.
Apr 17 20:43:39 <candy>	now look at the original colors
Apr 17 20:43:41 <candy>	https://ibb.co/D7dfQTb
Apr 17 20:43:48 <kchibisov>	they are not origianl
Apr 17 20:44:05 <kchibisov>	that's just your other terminal defined them.
Apr 17 20:44:11 <candy>	ok
Apr 17 20:44:12 <kchibisov>	we have our own colors.
Apr 17 20:44:17 <UndeadLeech>	If you don't like the colors, just change them?
Apr 17 20:44:18 <kchibisov>	some temrinal Y has their own.
Apr 17 20:44:20 <candy>	maybe i wrong
Apr 17 20:44:27 <candy>	that's a shell thing?
Apr 17 20:44:35 <kchibisov>	Shell askes for green.
Apr 17 20:44:37 <UndeadLeech>	The colors are identical.
Apr 17 20:44:41 <kchibisov>	asks*
Apr 17 20:44:44 <UndeadLeech>	They're just rendered differently.
Apr 17 20:44:57 <kchibisov>	we render green with value defined in our config.
Apr 17 20:45:12 <candy>	ok
Apr 17 20:45:20 <candy>	how can i change that?
Apr 17 20:45:28 <UndeadLeech>	The configuration file.
Apr 17 20:45:35 <kchibisov>	edit `alacritty.yml`
Apr 17 20:45:37 <candy>	it's in home?
Apr 17 20:45:44 <kchibisov>	you can place it in home.
Apr 17 20:45:44 <UndeadLeech>	You create it.
Apr 17 20:45:52 <UndeadLeech>	It's all documented on GitHub.
Apr 17 20:46:12 <kchibisov>	or was shipped with your distro package somewhere
Apr 17 20:46:22 <candy>	actually i think you need to improve the docs
Apr 17 20:46:30 <kchibisov>	how so?
Apr 17 20:47:03 <candy>	with pictures
Apr 17 20:47:08 <candy>	more visual
Apr 17 20:47:22 <kchibisov>	our docs are just .yml file.
Apr 17 20:47:29 <kchibisov>	what pictures do you want in .yml file?
Apr 17 20:47:29 <candy>	yea i saw
Apr 17 20:47:31 <UndeadLeech>	It's a terminal emulator...
Apr 17 20:47:37 <kchibisov>	^
Apr 17 20:47:37 <candy>	i know
Apr 17 20:48:03 <kchibisov>	I've never seen pictures of a terminal emulator tbh, they are all the same visually.
Apr 17 20:48:12 <kchibisov>	I mean multiple on front page.
Apr 17 20:48:28 <candy>	or maybe change the default shell color
Apr 17 20:48:42 <kchibisov>	What shell color?
Apr 17 20:48:53 <kchibisov>	Do you mean default color values?
Apr 17 20:48:57 <candy>	yes
Apr 17 20:48:59 <kchibisov>	That's subjective
Apr 17 20:49:01 <candy>	the hostname color etc
Apr 17 20:49:42 <kchibisov>	maybe you don't like them, someone else likes them, etc.
Apr 17 20:50:06 <candy>	i have to say i like it because of the performance
Apr 17 20:50:06 <kchibisov>	I mean colors.
Apr 17 20:50:14 <kchibisov>	if you don't like colors, just change them.
Apr 17 20:51:20 <candy>	you told me i need to place yml config file and i can choose the location. i am not sure how to set the location
Apr 17 20:51:20 <kchibisov>	We even has a wiki to copypaste colorschemes.
Apr 17 20:51:20 <kchibisov>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty#configuration
Apr 17 20:51:20 <candy>	i am using the binary file of this
Apr 17 20:51:20 <candy>	not package
Apr 17 20:51:41 <UndeadLeech>	The location for the configuration file is documented right in the readme.
Apr 17 20:51:48 <UndeadLeech>	It's also in the manpage.
Apr 17 20:52:34 <candy>	can i fetch only the man page?
Apr 17 20:52:49 <UndeadLeech>	I suppose you could.
Apr 17 20:53:03 <kchibisov>	I mean you've installed our binary somehow.
Apr 17 20:53:08 <candy>	yea
Apr 17 20:53:14 <candy>	i didn't installed
Apr 17 20:53:15 <kchibisov>	so if you have repo, then you have manpage in it.
Apr 17 20:53:21 <candy>	just run it
Apr 17 20:53:53 <candy>	sorry for my noob questions
Apr 17 20:54:14 <kchibisov>	our manpage doens't differ that match from alacritty --help
Apr 17 20:54:32 <UndeadLeech>	No problem, though reading through the documentation is likely going to be easier for you than having to wait for responses.
Apr 17 20:54:53 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: The difference matters here though, since `--help` does not document the config locations.
Apr 17 20:54:54 <UndeadLeech>	But the manpage does.
Apr 17 20:54:58 <kchibisov>	Specify alternative configuration file [default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml]
Apr 17 20:55:01 <kchibisov>	it has one of them at least.
Apr 17 20:55:32 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough.
Apr 17 20:56:57 <candy>	what you think about adding tabs option?
Apr 17 20:57:21 <kchibisov>	We think that your window manager should do that.
Apr 17 20:57:59 <kchibisov>	But you have plenty of options like tmux/tabbed/i3 to have tabs.
Apr 17 20:58:50 <candy>	only few people using i3 wm
Apr 17 20:59:08 <candy>	and in the other we can make new tab, lets say in lxde
Apr 17 20:59:14 <candy>	can
Apr 17 20:59:16 <candy>	can't
Apr 17 20:59:17 <kchibisov>	I feel like a giant chunk of our users are using i3/sway
Apr 17 20:59:26 <kchibisov>	even macOS has a concept of tabs on a wm level.
Apr 17 20:59:39 <kchibisov>	and for the rest, there's `tabbed`.
Apr 17 20:59:56 <UndeadLeech>	If you can't make tabs in your window manager, but you want multiple tabs in your window manager, you're using the wrong window manager.
Apr 17 21:00:23 <steinex>	:D
Apr 17 21:00:24 <ifreund>	^^^
Apr 17 21:00:27 <candy>	maybe you right :)
Apr 17 21:00:40 <kchibisov>	Just use tabbed from suckless, and embed alacritty into it.
Apr 17 21:00:47 <candy>	but i3 it too minimal
Apr 17 21:00:50 <UndeadLeech>	Though there are alternatives, like kchibisov has mentioned.
Apr 17 21:00:54 <ifreund>	no i3 is bloated
Apr 17 21:01:08 <ifreund>	(it's all relative)
Apr 17 21:01:10 <UndeadLeech>	Even has resize with mouse.
Apr 17 21:01:24 <candy>	what do you suggest?
Apr 17 21:01:35 <kchibisov>	idk, try `tabbed`.
Apr 17 21:01:35 <UndeadLeech>	It depends on your needs.
Apr 17 21:01:46 <UndeadLeech>	I run i3, but I never use tabs.
Apr 17 21:01:58 <UndeadLeech>	Someone else might run tmux, because they need it anyways.
Apr 17 21:02:00 <kchibisov>	I run sway and use tabs quite often.
Apr 17 21:02:49 <candy>	i'm using tmux
Apr 17 21:02:58 <kchibisov>	it has tabs as well.
Apr 17 21:03:09 <candy>	but you know, it has his Disadvantages
Apr 17 21:03:22 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah if you're running tmux anyways, just use tmux for tabs.
Apr 17 21:03:57 <kchibisov>	I don't see any problems with tmux at all, it's nice.
Apr 17 21:04:11 <kchibisov>	it aslo has a lot of flagship features, etc.
Apr 17 21:04:24 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it is slow.
Apr 17 21:04:28 <kchibisov>	not really.
Apr 17 21:04:33 <candy>	i didn't knew tmux can create tabs
Apr 17 21:04:39 <kchibisov>	like it's still faster than most terminal emulators.
Apr 17 21:04:41 <candy>	i mean background tabs
Apr 17 21:04:47 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but compared to raw Alacritty it's slow.
Apr 17 21:04:57 <kchibisov>	yeah, but it's faster than 99% of terminals.
Apr 17 21:05:11 <UndeadLeech>	Unfortunately I don't run 99% of terminals. :P
Apr 17 21:05:15 <kchibisov>	and then you have alacirtty, which is faster than tmux.
Apr 17 21:05:25 <kchibisov>	by like 2x.
Apr 17 21:05:51 <UndeadLeech>	I really wonder how an Alacritty based multiplexer would perform wrt overhead.
Apr 17 21:05:52 <ifreund>	i don't run tmux either, it does the same job as my window manager
Apr 17 21:05:58 <UndeadLeech>	One of these days I'm going to give it a try.
Apr 17 21:06:18 <ifreund>	like a client/sever session model? or what?
Apr 17 21:06:34 <UndeadLeech>	Nah, just a tmux/screen clone based on Alacritty.
Apr 17 21:06:35 <candy>	what is good wm other than i3?
Apr 17 21:06:47 <kchibisov>	it's up to your needs.
Apr 17 21:06:49 <ifreund>	dwm, awesomewm, xmonad sway
Apr 17 21:06:56 <kchibisov>	dwm lul.
Apr 17 21:07:09 <ifreund>	dude i liked dwm
Apr 17 21:07:19 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Apr 17 21:07:31 <ifreund>	but i don't like x, so i'm making my own dwm-alike for wayland
Apr 17 21:07:44 <kchibisov>	I hate a lot of things about i3 window management.
Apr 17 21:07:51 <ifreund>	same
Apr 17 21:07:57 <kchibisov>	but whatever.
Apr 17 21:07:58 <UndeadLeech>	dwm is the largest stockholm syndrome experiment to date.
Apr 17 21:08:11 <candy>	i3 is so lite
Apr 17 21:08:12 <candy>	that's cool
Apr 17 21:08:18 <candy>	what's about dwm?
Apr 17 21:08:23 <kchibisov>	it's even lighter.
Apr 17 21:08:29 <candy>	wow
Apr 17 21:08:29 <kchibisov>	like 1k lines of code.
Apr 17 21:08:33 <ifreund>	2k
Apr 17 21:08:34 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, it just doesn't do anything.
Apr 17 21:08:38 <kchibisov>	no tabs, nothing IIRC.
Apr 17 21:08:46 <kchibisov>	can tile though.
Apr 17 21:08:55 <ifreund>	tags and dynamic tiling isn't nothing
Apr 17 21:08:59 <ifreund>	i3 doesn't have tags
Apr 17 21:09:05 <candy>	in which lang it was written?
Apr 17 21:09:07 <ifreund>	c
Apr 17 21:09:11 <candy>	nice
Apr 17 21:09:15 <ifreund>	you configure it by editing the source code
Apr 17 21:09:21 <candy>	lol
Apr 17 21:09:27 <ifreund>	https://dwm.suckless.org/
Apr 17 21:09:28 <kchibisov>	I guess you can write it in whatever language you want under a few evenings.
Apr 17 21:09:43 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that's mostly because i3 doesn't want to have tags.
Apr 17 21:09:50 <ifreund>	yeah xmonad is basically dwm in haskell in even less sloc
Apr 17 21:09:55 <candy>	i am not so well in c
Apr 17 21:10:10 <UndeadLeech>	Though I do feel like there's a market for other tiling WMs. Just not dwm.
Apr 17 21:10:14 <candy>	i know how to program in it but i regular to python etc
Apr 17 21:10:23 <candy>	so i don't know how to handle the memory
Apr 17 21:10:35 <kchibisov>	i3 navigation between containers and multi monitor support is weird.
Apr 17 21:10:50 <kchibisov>	And resize is even weirder.
Apr 17 21:10:55 <ifreund>	yeah, i want separate roots for each monitor
Apr 17 21:11:02 <kchibisov>	like 2 widnows - ok, 6 windows - hell no.
Apr 17 21:11:17 <kchibisov>	glad sway has mouse for such things, since it's way easier than keyboard.
Apr 17 21:11:18 <UndeadLeech>	Oh yeah, I have that setup in i3.
Apr 17 21:11:21 <UndeadLeech>	The defaults just suck.
Apr 17 21:11:38 <UndeadLeech>	Like I have 5 workspaces on each monitor which cannot be shared across monitors.
Apr 17 21:11:49 <kchibisov>	like resize with keyboard in i3 is a shitstorm.
Apr 17 21:11:57 <ifreund>	for real
Apr 17 21:11:59 <kchibisov>	as well as traversion order.
Apr 17 21:12:06 <UndeadLeech>	i3 has mouse for resize too?
Apr 17 21:12:10 <UndeadLeech>	Or what do you mean?
Apr 17 21:12:12 <ifreund>	i just like dynamic window management better than manual though personally
Apr 17 21:12:15 <kchibisov>	I mean for window move.
Apr 17 21:12:27 <kchibisov>	resize is fine, nvm.
Apr 17 21:12:28 <ifreund>	which you can't really get in i3 no matter how much you configure
Apr 17 21:12:30 <kchibisov>	moving containers is broken.
Apr 17 21:12:37 <UndeadLeech>	How so?
Apr 17 21:12:37 <kchibisov>	however maybe new i3 has it.
Apr 17 21:12:42 <UndeadLeech>	ifreund: You can.
Apr 17 21:12:52 <UndeadLeech>	It would just be a bit of work.
Apr 17 21:12:52 <ifreund>	UndeadLeech: got a link?
Apr 17 21:12:53 <kchibisov>	it's hard, when you have plenty of them.
Apr 17 21:13:24 <ifreund>	i feel like no matter how you implement it it's going to be a massive hack and not work as well as a wm designed around it
Apr 17 21:13:25 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: How is it broken though, just out of curiosity?
Apr 17 21:13:40 <kchibisov>	I can record you a giga video of me trying to move window.
Apr 17 21:13:43 <ifreund>	maybe I'll convert y'all once my compositor is more feature complete
Apr 17 21:13:47 <UndeadLeech>	ifreund: That's not the same as saying you can't really get it no matter how much you configure.
Apr 17 21:14:19 <UndeadLeech>	Moving windows in i3 with the mouse you mean? While tiled?
Apr 17 21:14:21 <ifreund>	i meant that you can sorta aproximate it, but not in a satisfactory way (at least to me)
Apr 17 21:14:26 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: yeah.
Apr 17 21:14:37 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, gotcha. Like drag & drop or what?
Apr 17 21:14:47 <UndeadLeech>	I've never had any desire for that. Thought you were talking about floating windows or something.
Apr 17 21:14:48 <kchibisov>	yeah, this drag & drop works fine.
Apr 17 21:15:07 <kchibisov>	but moving with keyboard tiled windows if you have many of them is just hard.
Apr 17 21:15:21 <kchibisov>	you'll break your layout and everything 100 times during it.
Apr 17 21:16:26 <UndeadLeech>	I'd say that's just mostly something that depends on getting used to it, but the layout management of i3 certainly isn't perfect imho.
Apr 17 21:16:49 <UndeadLeech>	But I never have more than 3 windows open at the same time on the same monitor really.
Apr 17 21:17:09 <kchibisov>	I have somtimes like 8 windows on the same monitor.
Apr 17 21:17:33 <kchibisov>	I mean workspace.
Apr 17 21:19:28 <kchibisov>	Oh, and if you have tabbed container in this equation, everything will be even more broken.
Apr 17 21:20:04 <kchibisov>	Like it's not a problem if you use 3 windows max on workspace without tabs, etc.
Apr 17 21:22:59 <UndeadLeech>	Exactly what I'm saying.
Apr 17 21:23:09 <UndeadLeech>	Just gotta fix the user.
Apr 17 21:23:53 <UndeadLeech>	Also ifreund, are you writing your compositor in C based on WLC?
Apr 17 21:25:05 <kchibisov>	Though, once anvil will become more stable I'll just use it.
Apr 17 21:25:22 <kchibisov>	because it's anvil.
Apr 17 21:25:40 <ifreund>	UndeadLeech: in Zig based on wlroots
Apr 17 21:25:47 <UndeadLeech>	Isn't anvil floating?
Apr 17 21:25:50 <ifreund>	https://github.com/ifreund/river
Apr 17 21:25:55 <kchibisov>	it doesn't matter.
Apr 17 21:26:04 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough.
Apr 17 21:26:10 <kchibisov>	it's anvil and it works.
Apr 17 21:26:31 <UndeadLeech>	ifreund: What do you like about zig?
Apr 17 21:27:37 <ifreund>	So in comparison with Rust, it's a far simpler language and has much less painful interop with C, making it pretty ideal for this project
Apr 17 21:28:04 <kchibisov>	Nah, we need competition.
Apr 17 21:28:20 <kchibisov>	so smithay is the way to go.
Apr 17 21:28:28 <ifreund>	the ergonomics are pretty great and the finely grained pointer and optional pointer types are powerful enough that I'm not shooting myself in the foot anywhere near as easily as in C
Apr 17 21:30:10 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough, I'd assume by better interop you mean that the APIs are easier to use since it's more similar to C, rather than that connecting to those APIs is easier?
Apr 17 21:30:18 <UndeadLeech>	Since just the FFI part is pretty trivial in Rust too.
Apr 17 21:32:52 <ifreund>	both tbh, Zig lets you import C stuff directly without any need for bindings
Apr 17 21:33:04 <ifreund>	you're also definitely right about it being closer to C
Apr 17 21:33:38 <ifreund>	take the example of the offset_of macro that wayland-rs uses for the bindings to system wayland libs
Apr 17 21:34:12 <ifreund>	that macro is technically UB since rust doesn't have the required compiler builtins yet
Apr 17 21:34:42 <UndeadLeech>	I mean yeah, when it comes to the APIs of C just working better in Zig, I can totally see that.
Apr 17 21:34:43 <ifreund>	(this is translating the wl_container_of macro that gets a pointer to a struct from a pointer to a member and the name of the field)
Apr 17 21:34:52 <UndeadLeech>	That's why I'd just use the Wayland libs, rather than WLC tbh.
Apr 17 21:34:59 <ifreund>	Zig just has @fieldParentPtr
Apr 17 21:35:02 <kchibisov>	You see, Rust tells you to rewrite libwayland-client/server in Rust.
Apr 17 21:35:08 <kchibisov>	so you're safe.
Apr 17 21:35:40 <ifreund>	if you want my honest opinion, i don't think that RWIR is good engineering
Apr 17 21:36:06 <UndeadLeech>	I think rewriting things is always great.
Apr 17 21:36:21 <UndeadLeech>	Pretty much the best way to learn about things.
Apr 17 21:36:21 <ifreund>	if they're probelms with them, sure
Apr 17 21:36:22 <kchibisov>	exactly, especially if it'll be more secure.
Apr 17 21:36:30 <kchibisov>	or scalable.
Apr 17 21:37:00 <kchibisov>	Like the least thing I want is crashing of my compositor due to use-after-free.
Apr 17 21:37:07 <UndeadLeech>	Also systems languages are pretty much the only ones so heavily relying on C. Having alternatives is definitely a good choice.
Apr 17 21:37:17 <UndeadLeech>	There shouldn't be just one Wayland library.
Apr 17 21:37:19 <ifreund>	it is a very good way to learn as well, but it's not very pragmatic as rust libraries are not reusable outside of the rust ecosystem
Apr 17 21:37:35 <UndeadLeech>	That's not true.
Apr 17 21:37:55 <UndeadLeech>	Not necessarily at least.
Apr 17 21:38:00 <kchibisov>	Wayland is just a protocol, it doesn't matter what is on the other end.
Apr 17 21:38:10 <UndeadLeech>	That too of course.
Apr 17 21:38:13 <kchibisov>	like if it's rust lib or some C lib.
Apr 17 21:38:17 <kchibisov>	doesn't matter.
Apr 17 21:38:41 <UndeadLeech>	I mean one of the whole things about zig is that they don't use the C libc, right?
Apr 17 21:38:43 <kchibisov>	At least for server, since you only have one compostor running.
Apr 17 21:39:15 <ifreund>	yes, but exporting a C ABI with auto-generated C headers is a first class use-case for zig
Apr 17 21:39:33 <kchibisov>	I don't have any problems with zig.
Apr 17 21:39:42 <kchibisov>	I see that it could be useful for baremetal.
Apr 17 21:39:48 <ifreund>	to be clear I quite like rust too
Apr 17 21:40:02 <kchibisov>	However if it's using LLVM, I don't see much value for cross over rust.
Apr 17 21:40:54 <kchibisov>	since #[no_std] is fine to write kernels, etc.
Apr 17 21:41:05 <ifreund>	cross becomes a lot more painless due to the fact that Zig ships with the libcs of all the targets
Apr 17 21:41:07 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, bare metal without gcc is kinda tough tbh.
Apr 17 21:41:24 <UndeadLeech>	So that kinda defeats the point.
Apr 17 21:41:55 <kchibisov>	yeah, but you don't need libc for rust core IIRC.
Apr 17 21:42:20 <kchibisov>	The problem is LLVM limitations most of the time.
Apr 17 21:43:02 <ifreund>	rust std does depend on libc though right?
Apr 17 21:43:17 <kchibisov>	std probably, but you have core.
Apr 17 21:43:20 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, LLVM is the big thing people complain about with Rust's cross-platform support on embedded. So that's the same for zig.
Apr 17 21:43:41 <kchibisov>	like core isn't a problem in cross.
Apr 17 21:43:54 <kchibisov>	And it aslo has vector, etc.
Apr 17 21:44:15 <kchibisov>	With a bit more effort, but it's exaclty built for cross.
Apr 17 21:44:33 <UndeadLeech>	Also has a great VTE lib I heard.
Apr 17 21:44:51 <Levanx>	you need alloc to have the collections, core is not enough
Apr 17 21:45:03 <kchibisov>	yeah, but you can create your allocator.
Apr 17 21:45:28 <kchibisov>	So you'll have alloc, but still #[no_std]
Apr 17 21:46:33 <kchibisov>	vec is in alloc::vec::Vec, right.
Apr 17 21:46:33 <kchibisov>	but it's still can be #[no_std]
Apr 17 21:46:45 <UndeadLeech>	Nah, vec is std exclusive iirc. But there are crates for no-std vec.
Apr 17 21:47:35 <kchibisov>	I've seen alloc::vec::Vec on #[no_std] recently.
Apr 17 21:48:38 <Levanx>	https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc/vec/struct.Vec.html
Apr 17 21:48:38 <Levanx>	looks like alloc to me
Apr 17 21:48:38 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, you're right: https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/vec/struct.Vec.html
Apr 17 21:48:38 <UndeadLeech>	But it doesn't show up in core::alloc: https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/alloc/index.html?search=
Apr 17 21:48:58 <UndeadLeech>	Only in alloc::.
Apr 17 21:49:28 <UndeadLeech>	So there's ::alloc, std::alloc, core::alloc, std::vec::Vec and alloc::vec::Vec.
Apr 17 21:49:28 <UndeadLeech>	Simple.
Apr 17 21:50:11 <Levanx>	Half of std is reexports from core or alloc though
Apr 17 21:50:19 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Apr 17 21:50:42 <UndeadLeech>	I'm fine with two different allocs, three's just a bit much.
Apr 17 21:51:12 <Levanx>	Probably they could have been better named
Apr 17 21:51:49 <Levanx>	I understand core::alloc as the APIs for defining an allocator, and ::alloc as a collection of containers & types needing an allocator
Apr 17 21:52:01 <kchibisov>	IIRC to make Vec work you need #[global_allocator] somewhere on your #[no_std]
Apr 17 21:52:27 <kchibisov>	Since you don't have allocator on bare metal for known reasons.
Apr 17 21:52:48 <kchibisov>	once you have dynamic memory you can use it.
Apr 17 21:53:03 <Levanx>	We need CPUs with a malloc opcode then
Apr 17 21:53:53 <kchibisov>	I mean you can define [0u64;1000] area and say that's your dynamic memory.
Apr 17 21:54:13 <ifreund>	ah yeah that's another thing I really appreciate about zig, allocators are all local and you have total controll
Apr 17 21:54:46 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: I think that ::alloc is kind of a recent thing, right?
Apr 17 21:54:55 <UndeadLeech>	That's probably some of the reason why it is the way it is.
Apr 17 21:55:14 <UndeadLeech>	Since Rust's STD cannot introduce breaking changes ever.
Apr 17 21:55:31 <Levanx>	Its stabilization is relatively recent yeah
Apr 17 21:55:50 <Levanx>	it has been existing on nightly for quite some time though
Apr 17 21:56:35 <Levanx>	stabilized in 1.36.0 looks like
Apr 17 21:56:51 <kchibisov>	Yeah, just fine out code that uses #[no_std] + Vec from `alloc::vec::Vec`
Apr 17 21:56:52 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah that's like extremely recent.
Apr 17 21:57:02 <UndeadLeech>	The whole custom allocator thing is fairly fresh.
Apr 17 21:57:08 <kchibisov>	without any external crates.
Apr 17 21:57:27 <kchibisov>	custom allocator isn't that fresh.
Apr 17 21:57:45 <kchibisov>	it was during jemalloc/sys allocator updates.
Apr 17 21:58:00 <UndeadLeech>	Pretty fresh if you ask me.
Apr 17 21:58:07 <Levanx>	<ifreund "ah yeah that's another thing I r"> There is one thing that wayland-rs does not support at all that the C libwayland lib handle, it's OOM.
Apr 17 21:58:40 <UndeadLeech>	How do they handle it and during what time might you run into OOM?
Apr 17 21:59:37 <Levanx>	Well, they check the return value of malloc and return NULL if it is NULL, mostly.
Apr 17 22:00:18 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, so you just mean in general rather than some specific cases? Since Rust doesn't handle OOM?
Apr 17 22:00:37 <Levanx>	In Rust currently, OOM => panic
Apr 17 22:00:42 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah exactly.
Apr 17 22:00:45 <kchibisov>	but you can catch panic.
Apr 17 22:01:31 <Levanx>	Well yeah but
Apr 17 22:01:59 <kchibisov>	I still think that checking malloc won't help if you if get `NULL`
Apr 17 22:02:15 <ifreund>	what? why not?
Apr 17 22:02:40 <kchibisov>	Like it could help, but if your system already goes to OOM, kernel will just start killing everyone.
Apr 17 22:03:17 <ifreund>	well if everything crashes execept your program, it may very well survive
Apr 17 22:03:34 <kchibisov>	nah, I can make my GPU driver to leak 64GB
Apr 17 22:03:53 <kchibisov>	and kernel won't free that memory ever.
Apr 17 22:04:00 <ifreund>	hah
Apr 17 22:04:00 <kchibisov>	like whatever.
Apr 17 22:04:18 <kchibisov>	and UndeadLeech even reproduced that bug at some point IIRC.
Apr 17 22:04:25 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Apr 17 22:04:50 <kchibisov>	And we now that removing kernel module for your GPU isn't a good idea.
Apr 17 22:04:58 <Levanx>	driver bugs are always the best part
Apr 17 22:05:47 <ifreund>	which driver is this?
Apr 17 22:05:59 <kchibisov>	amdgpu
Apr 17 22:06:14 <ifreund>	hah i guess it will happen to me someday as well then
Apr 17 22:06:21 <kchibisov>	oh, you can try.
Apr 17 22:06:24 <Yaniel>	what bug with amdgpu?
Apr 17 22:06:37 <Yaniel>	oh, a memory leak
Apr 17 22:06:47 <Levanx>	Oh, how do you make it leak that much memory? I'll have to try it when I go back to the lab
Apr 17 22:06:56 <kchibisov>	it's not really a leak.
Apr 17 22:07:08 <kchibisov>	amdgpu can use RAM if it runs out of dedicated memory
Apr 17 22:07:15 <kchibisov>	by default.
Apr 17 22:07:29 <Yaniel>	yes that's how OpenGL works
Apr 17 22:07:52 <Levanx>	and that is never freed ?
Apr 17 22:07:56 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 17 22:08:10 <kchibisov>	and it goes like from 8GB to 64GB under a second.
Apr 17 22:08:34 <kchibisov>	Just increase font in alacritty, and at some point it'll blow up.
Apr 17 22:08:48 <kchibisov>	At least it was true somee time ago, when I've found it out.
Apr 17 22:09:03 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, I wasn't able to reload my kernel module. :) Didn't go well.
Apr 17 22:09:04 <kchibisov>	like 5 months ago.
Apr 17 22:09:13 <UndeadLeech>	Unless you like black screens.
Apr 17 22:09:25 <kchibisov>	but you should do it for some time.
Apr 17 22:09:49 <Levanx>	Black screens do have some kind of aesthetics though
Apr 17 22:10:01 <UndeadLeech>	True.
Apr 17 22:10:13 <UndeadLeech>	If you're lucky it will just kill X and because of that close Alacritty though.
Apr 17 22:10:27 <kchibisov>	but memory won't be freed.
Apr 17 22:10:43 <kchibisov>	even if you logout.
Apr 17 22:10:44 <UndeadLeech>	You sure? I thought that it worked for me. I don't quite remember.
Apr 17 22:10:59 <kchibisov>	I've logged out/logged in and there was a leak.
Apr 17 22:11:00 <UndeadLeech>	But yeah, I just don't remember anymore.
Apr 17 22:11:16 <UndeadLeech>	I do remember not being able to free stuff anymore.
Apr 17 22:11:21 <kchibisov>	like 48 GB of memory without even a process in htop.
Apr 17 22:11:21 <Levanx>	Who needs more than 640kB of memory though
Apr 17 22:12:21 <kchibisov>	If someone will repro this bug, let me know.
Apr 17 22:12:31 <kchibisov>	I don't want to try it one more time.
Apr 17 22:12:39 <Yaniel>	I did manage to cause a kernel panic from amdgpu recently but I don't think it was related to this
Apr 17 22:12:52 <UndeadLeech>	You really have to look for this to work.
Apr 17 22:13:01 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 17 22:13:10 <Yaniel>	since it happened when I tried hw encoding video at 4K
Apr 17 22:13:12 <kchibisov>	you should increase font in alacritty for some time.
Apr 17 22:13:40 <kchibisov>	like a minute or two.
Apr 17 22:15:37 <kchibisov>	but the funnies thing here, that kernel will be killing everyone, because no process is owning this memory at all.
Apr 17 22:15:50 <kchibisov>	funniest*
Apr 17 22:16:07 <UndeadLeech>	The Purge.
Apr 17 22:16:17 <Levanx>	how to make the oom killer freak out
Apr 17 22:16:34 <kchibisov>	but hey, it works at least.
Apr 17 22:17:52 <Levanx>	Does that end up with a "Kernel panic: attempted to kill init!" ?
Apr 17 22:18:04 <Levanx>	I've hit this message a few times, don't remember how though
Apr 17 22:18:07 <kchibisov>	I pressed reboot earlier.
Apr 17 22:18:33 <kchibisov>	but you can try!
Apr 17 22:19:26 <kchibisov>	I feel like this bug should be still there.
Apr 17 22:19:40 <Levanx>	I don't have my amgpu laptop with me, I left it at the lab. So I have to wait to be allowed to go work again.
Apr 17 22:19:53 <Levanx>	The suspense is going to kill me :'(
Apr 17 22:19:58 <UndeadLeech>	It came back for me after killing Alacritty.
Apr 17 22:20:02 <UndeadLeech>	Just tested it.
Apr 17 22:20:09 <kchibisov>	:- )
Apr 17 22:20:14 <kchibisov>	so bug is still there.
Apr 17 22:20:15 <UndeadLeech>	https://paste.rs/zHR.png
Apr 17 22:20:23 <UndeadLeech>	But the 11G memory are gone.
Apr 17 22:21:05 <UndeadLeech>	I think that's what happened for me last time too. So you're right that there's no way to get back that memory, but you might be able to recover.
Apr 17 22:21:13 <UndeadLeech>	Guess I'll see you guys after a reboot. :)
Apr 17 22:21:31 <kchibisov>	11 GB isn't a thing, just let them chill around.
Apr 17 22:21:48 <UndeadLeech>	I mean I could. But I can't.
Apr 17 22:21:51 <Levanx>	What kind of computer is that
Apr 17 22:21:56 <Levanx>	48 cpus ? :o
Apr 17 22:21:57 <UndeadLeech>	That's my desktop.
Apr 17 22:22:14 <Yaniel>	presumably (logical) cores
Apr 17 22:22:45 <Levanx>	yeah but still
Apr 17 22:22:49 <Levanx>	Do you have a Xeon on your desktop ?
Apr 17 22:22:57 <Yaniel>	I'm guessing two xeons
Apr 17 22:23:07 <kchibisov>	it's just threadripper for 24 cores.
Apr 17 22:23:50 <kchibisov>	https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3960x
Apr 17 22:23:53 <Yaniel>	oh right that has a 24/48 variant too
Apr 17 22:24:27 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, it's the 3960X.
Apr 17 22:25:07 <Levanx>	Wow, AMD sure went down the "moar cores" road
Apr 17 22:25:21 <UndeadLeech>	Not having a power of 2 as CPUs is a bit annoying, but I just couldn't justify paying even more.
Apr 17 22:25:43 <UndeadLeech>	At least it divides nicely by 3.
Apr 17 22:27:33 *	Levanx just checked the price on Amazon.
Apr 17 22:27:43 <Levanx>	._.
Apr 17 22:28:16 <kchibisov>	but hey, imagine gentoo on this thing.
Apr 17 22:28:24 <kchibisov>	system update is a breeze.
Apr 17 22:28:39 <Levanx>	I can imagine that, yeah
Apr 17 22:29:01 <kchibisov>	like on my 8 core system kernen takes like 90 seconds.
Apr 17 22:29:06 <Levanx>	Compiling rustc must take, hmmm, at least 10 minutes
Apr 17 22:29:13 <Yaniel>	*cries in 4 cores without HT*
Apr 17 22:29:48 <kchibisov>	but with let's say 32/64 it's just waiting for linker.
Apr 17 22:29:59 <Yaniel>	heh
Apr 17 22:31:22 <Levanx>	The time I contributed a little to rustc, on my poor i5, was quite a painful experience
Apr 17 22:32:27 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, even on this machine it's basically all linking.
Apr 17 22:32:37 <UndeadLeech>	Though debug mode Alacritty with lldb is pretty fast.
Apr 17 22:32:47 <kchibisov>	lldb?
Apr 17 22:32:55 <UndeadLeech>	lld, not lldb.
Apr 17 22:32:57 <kchibisov>	time to lldb my code.
Apr 17 22:33:02 <UndeadLeech>	:P
Apr 17 22:33:24 <kchibisov>	I feel like I don't need to sleep that often tbh.
Apr 17 22:33:42 <UndeadLeech>	What?
Apr 17 22:33:44 <kchibisov>	Like I have giga PRs around to review and shit ton of code to write.
Apr 17 22:34:01 <kchibisov>	Should be fine.
Apr 17 22:34:27 <kchibisov>	Also, UndeadLeech , is it a bug or feature with selection expansion on shell?
Apr 17 22:34:39 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, good thing search is only 1000 lines on top of the existing PR.
Apr 17 22:34:43 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Apr 17 22:35:00 <kchibisov>	I mean when you paste with middle click you auto extend selection
Apr 17 22:35:08 <kchibisov>	Have you reprod it?
Apr 17 22:36:02 <kchibisov>	it's a thing on master as well, but I'm not sure what this thing is.
Apr 17 22:36:51 <kchibisov>	I feel like it's a bug.
Apr 17 22:36:51 <UndeadLeech>	Selection always auto expands.
Apr 17 22:36:53 <UndeadLeech>	No matter what you do.
Apr 17 22:37:00 <UndeadLeech>	That has always been how it works.
Apr 17 22:37:35 <kchibisov>	Oh, it's a correct behavior.
Apr 17 22:37:55 <kchibisov>	since it's a word, and you increase word len.
Apr 17 22:38:08 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah. It's always been a bit weird to me.
Apr 17 22:38:12 <kchibisov>	so you just update it to include word.
Apr 17 22:38:15 <kchibisov>	whatever.
Apr 17 22:38:20 <UndeadLeech>	But expansion is done at render time, not at selection time.
Apr 17 22:38:35 <kchibisov>	yeah, I know, we started doing so recently.
Apr 17 22:38:38 <UndeadLeech>	So I don't want to say it should definitely work the way it does, but it has always at least until now.
Apr 17 22:41:10 <kchibisov>	But at least we found out a lot of strange issues about our reflow.
Apr 17 22:42:16 <UndeadLeech>	Gotta look at the bright things. If something's not working amazingly well, it's an opportunity to make it.
Apr 17 22:42:51 *	kchibisov looks at our renderer, closes our renderer code.
Apr 17 22:43:03 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think that's terrible tbh.
Apr 17 22:43:08 <UndeadLeech>	Like reflow is much worse.
Apr 17 22:43:19 <kchibisov>	it's not terrible, it's strange.
Apr 17 22:43:20 <UndeadLeech>	The worst parts are just all the OpenGL stuff.
Apr 17 22:43:26 <UndeadLeech>	Which is how OpenGL works.
Apr 17 22:43:42 <kchibisov>	everything in render/mod.rs is just strange.
Apr 17 22:43:53 <kchibisov>	starting from live reload of shaders from build directory.
Apr 17 22:44:05 <kchibisov>	I mean project root or whatever.
Apr 17 22:44:18 <UndeadLeech>	Huh, don't really feel the same. All the glyph/font/atlas stuff is pretty good imho.
Apr 17 22:44:38 <UndeadLeech>	Live shader reload is a bit strange, that's true.
Apr 17 22:45:11 <UndeadLeech>	Which is why I've proposed removing it before. I feel like we either need to make it a first class citizen or just scrap it. It might have originally been there to make development easier, I'm not sure.
Apr 17 22:45:38 <UndeadLeech>	Like that's the only usecase I see for how it works at the moment.
Apr 17 22:46:14 <kchibisov>	you should edit your shader in nano to make it work.
Apr 17 22:46:51 <UndeadLeech>	Right, there was some kind of issue with reloading files instead of directories.
Apr 17 22:47:06 <UndeadLeech>	Though I don't really remember what it was.
Apr 17 22:47:17 <UndeadLeech>	Vim replaces the file instead of changing it?
Apr 17 22:47:27 <kchibisov>	I've used this feature only once.
Apr 17 22:47:55 <UndeadLeech>	I've never used this feature for anything other than testing it out to mess with funky shaders.
Apr 17 22:48:37 <kchibisov>	I feel like util.rs files are just neccessary evil sometimes.
Apr 17 22:48:47 <UndeadLeech>	Never!
Apr 17 22:48:53 <kchibisov>	like I have no idea where to put some glue code.
Apr 17 22:49:35 <kchibisov>	Like I don't need it in public, just in 2 different modules.
Apr 17 22:49:39 <kchibisov>	which are not connected
Apr 17 22:49:49 <UndeadLeech>	Just found the `limit` function, which we use in exactly one place.
Apr 17 22:49:50 <UndeadLeech>	Nice.
Apr 17 22:50:41 <kchibisov>	I really don't see where you'll put something like `spawned_named` tbh.
Apr 17 22:50:52 <kchibisov>	spawn_named*
Apr 17 22:51:00 <kchibisov>	or start_daemon
Apr 17 22:51:37 <kchibisov>	touch util.rs
Apr 17 22:52:11 <UndeadLeech>	alacritty_terminal/thread.rs?
Apr 17 22:52:27 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, nvm you're talking about the process stuff not thread.
Apr 17 22:52:35 <UndeadLeech>	alacritty_terminal/process.rs?
Apr 17 22:52:45 <kchibisov>	and alacritty_terminal/thread.rs as well
Apr 17 22:53:10 <kchibisov>	just 2 files with 1 function each.
Apr 17 22:53:25 <UndeadLeech>	At least it's not 1 file with a shitty name!
Apr 17 22:53:26 <kchibisov>	and copyright message larger than the entire file.
Apr 17 22:53:50 <UndeadLeech>	I don't really understand the capyright message anyways.
Apr 17 22:54:00 <kchibisov>	I also wonder whether we should use it for new files
Apr 17 22:54:00 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not quite sure about its purpose.
Apr 17 22:54:09 <kchibisov>	But we can't just remove it
Apr 17 22:54:17 <UndeadLeech>	Why not?
Apr 17 22:54:32 <kchibisov>	This is not how it works, since you should likely request perm.
Apr 17 22:54:52 <UndeadLeech>	It's apache2 anyways though.
Apr 17 22:54:59 <UndeadLeech>	Like it doesn't change the license.
Apr 17 22:55:06 <kchibisov>	Since you're technically relicense source.
Apr 17 22:55:06 <UndeadLeech>	You're not.
Apr 17 22:55:18 <UndeadLeech>	That's why I don't really understand it.
Apr 17 23:00:06 <kchibisov>	idk, LLVM is also using it right in source.
Apr 17 23:00:27 <UndeadLeech>	Does it have the license listed separately?
Apr 17 23:00:33 <kchibisov>	yeah
Apr 17 23:00:44 <kchibisov>	it's Apache 2 with LLVM extenstions.
Apr 17 23:01:27 <kchibisov>	each project has LICENSE.txt
Apr 17 23:01:51 <UndeadLeech>	Is it the same everywhere?
Apr 17 23:02:04 <UndeadLeech>	I feel like this would only be useful if the entire project isn't under the same license.
Apr 17 23:02:25 <kchibisov>	it's some political thing tbh.
Apr 17 23:02:41 <UndeadLeech>	As far as I know, there is absolutely no legal requirement for it.
Apr 17 23:02:52 <UndeadLeech>	So removing it from the top of files does not change anything about the licensing.
Apr 17 23:03:42 <ifreund>	yeah i've never understood that thing either, but so many projects seem to do it
Apr 17 23:05:05 <UndeadLeech>	For now I've just gone with the approach of not adding it to new files, but I suppose I could remove it from everywhere for uniformity.
Apr 17 23:05:53 <kchibisov>	I'd rather understand the reason behind such thing first tbh.
Apr 17 23:05:57 <kchibisov>	like there should be a reason.
Apr 17 23:06:42 <ifreund>	i feel like in 90% of cases people are just doing it cause they see others do it
Apr 17 23:06:44 <UndeadLeech>	As far as I understand it, the purpose is to make it easier to find the license of each specific file without risk of confusion.
Apr 17 23:07:02 <UndeadLeech>	Like if someone just copy/pasted our util.rs into their own project, it would automatically copy over the license too.
Apr 17 23:07:26 <UndeadLeech>	So the license is automatically enforced.
Apr 17 23:07:47 <kchibisov>	I feel like it makes the mose sense for GPL
Apr 17 23:07:53 <kchibisov>	most*
Apr 17 23:08:08 <kchibisov>	you see GPL, you don't touch this thing.
Apr 17 23:08:57 <UndeadLeech>	Like for apache 2 you need to include the full license of the original file too.
Apr 17 23:09:13 <UndeadLeech>	So if one wanted to copy our util.rs, it would be done automatically.
Apr 17 23:09:23 <UndeadLeech>	If it's not part of the file, they'd have to do it manually.
Apr 17 23:10:06 <kchibisov>	I mean that if you copy random GPL-3 code on the internet to your MIT project you're fucked, right?
Apr 17 23:10:37 <kchibisov>	e.g. you can't copy code from gcc to LLVM most of the time.
Apr 17 23:10:47 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Apr 17 23:10:48 <kchibisov>	so LLVM has to rewrite the same functions in asm sometimes.
Apr 17 23:12:56 <UndeadLeech>	MIT is compatible with GPL, but not the other way around. So you can have MIT in GPL projects, but not GPL in MIT projects.
Apr 17 23:13:37 <kchibisov>	yeah, so if you copy MIT code in GPL code you should preserve MIT, right?
Apr 17 23:14:05 <kchibisov>	Like it should be right in the source.
Apr 17 23:14:29 <UndeadLeech>	> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
Apr 17 23:14:32 <UndeadLeech>	copies or substantial portions of the Software.
Apr 17 23:14:46 <UndeadLeech>	This is what the MIT license says. So yeah it probably needs to be distributed with the software.
Apr 17 23:17:34 <kchibisov>	So it makes sense to have it in files.
Apr 17 23:17:50 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure it does.
Apr 17 23:17:52 <kchibisov>	like you can have LLVM right in your project and change it.
Apr 17 23:17:54 <UndeadLeech>	Like it's not our problem.
Apr 17 23:18:29 <kchibisov>	Like you can clearly state that 'this code is a part of XXX' with 'YYY changes'
Apr 17 23:18:48 <kchibisov>	and YYY changes has a different license than XXX.
Apr 17 23:18:56 <kchibisov>	it should be valid, right?
Apr 17 23:19:20 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but honestly I don't see why we would make our code worse to make license compatibility easier for others.
Apr 17 23:19:30 <UndeadLeech>	I don't really want to bother with that mess.
Apr 17 23:19:50 <kchibisov>	me neiter, but I don't mind those headers.
Apr 17 23:20:23 <UndeadLeech>	I kinda do.
Apr 17 23:20:27 <UndeadLeech>	But it's fine for now.
Apr 17 23:21:19 <kchibisov>	Just start putting your name and it'll be fine.

Apr 18 18:13:40 <UndeadLeech>	No, Termite's character does not exist.
Apr 18 18:13:49 <UndeadLeech>	We're using the font, Termite does not.
Apr 18 18:14:50 <randomia>	Oh thank you. I thought I was going bonkers there.
Apr 18 18:15:29 <randomia>	Have a nice day UndeadLeech :)
Apr 18 20:38:31 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: How would you expect search to work with highlighting everything? Freeze new input?
Apr 18 20:41:01 <kchibisov>	I feel like it applies to normal search as well?
Apr 18 20:41:20 <UndeadLeech>	In a way, yeah.
Apr 18 20:41:28 <UndeadLeech>	But tracking a million points is harder than traking two.
Apr 18 20:42:07 <kchibisov>	Oh, can we hold screen?
Apr 18 20:42:18 <UndeadLeech>	That's what I'm asking. If we should do that.
Apr 18 20:42:24 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure that it's the right thing to do, but it'll be interesting.
Apr 18 20:42:33 <kchibisov>	like you just start changing display_offset.
Apr 18 20:42:34 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah I have similar feelings.
Apr 18 20:42:57 <kchibisov>	I feel like it's fine tbh.
Apr 18 20:43:09 <kchibisov>	like at which point do you want to search scrolling text?
Apr 18 20:43:19 <kchibisov>	I always want to stop it.
Apr 18 20:43:31 <UndeadLeech>	I'm wondering if we should do that in general, once we have it in place anyways.
Apr 18 20:43:45 <kchibisov>	I guess.
Apr 18 20:44:09 <UndeadLeech>	Also wondering if that tiny bit of code removed from scroll_up scroll_down would affect performance at all.
Apr 18 20:47:38 <UndeadLeech>	On the other hand, rotation isn't that difficult.
Apr 18 20:48:38 <cole-h>	As a user, I think I'd rather freeze new input. If you're searching for something, it's usually something  that has already been displayed, so searching newly-displayed stuff has little to no value IMO
Apr 18 20:48:54 <UndeadLeech>	How about selection?
Apr 18 20:49:44 <UndeadLeech>	And vi mode too I suppose.
Apr 18 20:49:48 <cole-h>	Like if I were to hold Shift+Left click while stuff scrolls? Hm.
Apr 18 20:51:11 <cole-h>	Most of the time I do that, I'm already scrolled up a little bit (and so new content doesn't affect it). So, I think freezing that should be fine as well?
Apr 18 20:52:22 <cole-h>	I don't know about vi, though.
Apr 18 20:53:52 <UndeadLeech>	I'm also not even sure anymore if it's worth it to try and track points during resize then.
Apr 18 20:54:21 <UndeadLeech>	Or if we should just always freeze and then clear action whenever resizing.
Apr 18 21:34:11 <holomorph>	hi, i'm making some bindings like so http://ix.io/2iAH to replicate some xterm modifyOtherKeys business.  i'm wondering how i would bind things like C-(, C-), or C-?
Apr 18 21:35:09 <holomorph>	glutin appears to be missing keycodes for these, and i'm not sure what showkey --scancodes is telling me or if i can use scancodes for such a key combo
Apr 18 21:37:42 <kchibisov>	You can get scancodes by `alacritty --print-events | grep -i keyboardinput`
Apr 18 21:44:09 <holomorph>	kchibisov: oic. got it, thank you
Apr 18 21:46:41 <kchibisov>	if it shows you vitrualkeycode then you can bind by it + modifier
Apr 18 21:48:50 <holomorph>	which comes from glutin, so yeah
Apr 18 22:06:59 <mynamehere>	Sorry to keep bothering you guys, but I have been doing some distro hopping and installing various distros across different systems.... Right now I am trying pop_OS and alacritty is acting strange. Backspaces move and don't remove any of the words. tmux responds with "open terminal failed: missing or unsuitable terminal: alacritty" and  commands such as clear and reset respond with "unknown
Apr 18 22:07:01 <mynamehere>	terminal type"
Apr 18 22:07:24 <mynamehere>	backspaces move forward*
Apr 18 22:07:44 <wma>	you need to copy the terminfo
Apr 18 22:08:25 <wma>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/INSTALL.md#terminfo
Apr 18 22:45:28 <mynamehere>	Okay, so now all that works, but there are only colors if tmux is activated
Apr 18 22:47:05 <gamara>	Hey does anyone know how to get a terminal to load into scratch pad on startup on sway? I cant seem to get this to work at all I am running 4.2 and none of the methods I have found seem to work.
Apr 18 22:48:38 <mynamehere>	well actually that'll work for now, thanks @wma!

Apr 19 14:45:37 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Have you ever used search in Kitty?
Apr 19 14:45:58 <kchibisov>	I've never used any terminal for more than 1 hour.
Apr 19 14:46:18 <UndeadLeech>	So is that a yes or a no?
Apr 19 14:46:23 <kchibisov>	no
Apr 19 14:46:33 <kchibisov>	and it's true for everything except tmux/alacritty.
Apr 19 14:46:44 <kchibisov>	and I have some memory about iterm.
Apr 19 14:46:58 <kchibisov>	like I've pressed it for sure in it, but I don't rememeber.
Apr 19 14:47:01 <UndeadLeech>	Ah. I thought you were the one suggesting the separate terminal opening the scrollback in less like Kitty.
Apr 19 14:47:11 <kchibisov>	No
Apr 19 14:47:28 <UndeadLeech>	I'm just wondering about the drawbacks of that approach.
Apr 19 14:47:52 <UndeadLeech>	Like is a vi mode and search even necessary, when you can open the scrollback in vim in the same terminal emulator without any hassle?
Apr 19 14:49:10 <kchibisov>	If you can do that inplace -> no issues.
Apr 19 14:49:38 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you could start up a separate terminal and replace the current one.
Apr 19 14:49:58 <kchibisov>	but it sounds like one giant hack.
Apr 19 14:50:00 <UndeadLeech>	And it would automatically support all vim motions, not just some of them. Though with vim you wouldn't get color.
Apr 19 14:50:21 <UndeadLeech>	It does, but search and vimode is getting a bit hacky too tbh.
Apr 19 14:50:41 <kchibisov>	I mean search and vimode are fine.
Apr 19 14:50:49 <UndeadLeech>	Like I'm just thinking that we might be able to simplify things so much more if we just let vi do what it's good at, instead of trying to do it ourselves.
Apr 19 14:51:17 <UndeadLeech>	Otoh, I'm trying to figure out a good reason not to, because I don't want to throw away everything I've been doing for the past like month. :P
Apr 19 14:51:18 <kchibisov>	then add tabs
Apr 19 14:51:35 <kchibisov>	if you really want to make it work, we need tabs, etc.
Apr 19 14:51:41 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Apr 19 14:51:53 <kchibisov>	opening shit in place without creating a new instance
Apr 19 14:52:13 <kchibisov>	like I don't want to open one more terminal.
Apr 19 14:52:13 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you can just replace the terminal that is currently active and store the old one for later use.
Apr 19 14:52:26 <kchibisov>	yeah, but you're already 50% done tabs.
Apr 19 14:52:28 <kchibisov>	if you do that.
Apr 19 14:52:46 <UndeadLeech>	I mean everything but the UI, yeah. But the UI is like the exact thing I don't want to do.
Apr 19 14:52:54 <UndeadLeech>	We'll need to 50% do tabs to support it for macOS too.
Apr 19 14:53:05 <UndeadLeech>	So I feel like some of this work will need to be done sooner or later anyways.
Apr 19 14:53:07 <kchibisov>	and for multi window.
Apr 19 14:53:11 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah exactly.
Apr 19 14:53:13 <kchibisov>	but I like our current vi mode.
Apr 19 14:53:37 <kchibisov>	and I'll refuse to open vim in place with grid.
Apr 19 14:53:42 <UndeadLeech>	I don't disagree with that. I feel like swapping to another application could be a bit jarring.
Apr 19 14:53:57 <UndeadLeech>	Let me actually play around with Kitty for a bit. See how it works out.
Apr 19 14:54:06 <kchibisov>	don't forget that I can paste from vi mode right into app.
Apr 19 14:54:28 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, right. You don't need to close vi to get back to Alacritty.
Apr 19 14:54:49 <kchibisov>	don't forget to give it some milk, once you've done.
Apr 19 14:54:55 <UndeadLeech>	:P
Apr 19 14:55:04 <kchibisov>	But I don't like spawning vi.
Apr 19 14:55:11 <kchibisov>	like you'll break layout of the app, etc.
Apr 19 14:55:28 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean by that?
Apr 19 14:55:48 <kchibisov>	imagine opening weechat in vim.
Apr 19 14:56:04 <kchibisov>	I mean vim with weechat content to just select
Apr 19 14:56:08 <UndeadLeech>	I mean since the horizontal width is the same, it shouldn't be too bad.
Apr 19 14:56:17 <kchibisov>	my weechat is using tabs
Apr 19 14:56:24 <kchibisov>	vim is using spaces
Apr 19 14:56:38 <kchibisov>	weechat is larger than vim.
Apr 19 14:56:50 <kchibisov>	due to line number by default in vim.
Apr 19 14:56:52 <UndeadLeech>	Ah you mean like different tabwidth configured?
Apr 19 14:56:57 <kchibisov>	ofc.
Apr 19 14:56:59 <UndeadLeech>	Right, right.
Apr 19 14:57:07 <kchibisov>	you'll loose colors, etc.
Apr 19 14:57:13 <kchibisov>	and live update of content.
Apr 19 14:57:16 <UndeadLeech>	I mean Kitty is using `less` by default.
Apr 19 14:57:20 <UndeadLeech>	Which works much better.
Apr 19 14:57:27 <kchibisov>	select with keyboard in less
Apr 19 14:57:41 <UndeadLeech>	But it obviously doesn't work for vi mode, just for search yeah.
Apr 19 14:57:57 <kchibisov>	so I should use vi as pager
Apr 19 14:58:05 <kchibisov>	and we should dump with truecolors
Apr 19 14:58:40 <kchibisov>	this is just never ending shit show.
Apr 19 14:58:54 <UndeadLeech>	It's difficult. But if a pager would exist that allowed vi mode, it should work out great.
Apr 19 14:59:04 <UndeadLeech>	And that might be a problem that can be tackled independently.
Apr 19 14:59:44 <kchibisov>	and then you should also live reload pager
Apr 19 14:59:59 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think that's necessary tbh.
Apr 19 15:00:11 <UndeadLeech>	Like we were discussing freezing Alacritty anyways.
Apr 19 15:00:11 <kchibisov>	what if I just chilling in vi mode and open random links
Apr 19 15:00:20 <kchibisov>	I mean for search when scrolling is done
Apr 19 15:00:30 <kchibisov>	but in alt-screen you won't freeze anything
Apr 19 15:00:47 <kchibisov>	I mean freezing scrolling, not content update
Apr 19 15:00:49 <UndeadLeech>	Either everywhere or nowhere.
Apr 19 15:01:12 <kchibisov>	but we need a good way to update our terminal atomically
Apr 19 15:01:16 <UndeadLeech>	I was always talking about freezing content update, since that's what URxvt/VTE do.
Apr 19 15:01:49 <kchibisov>	I mean we need it at some point.
Apr 19 15:01:57 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Apr 19 15:02:04 <kchibisov>	sync updates.
Apr 19 15:02:30 <kchibisov>	since you need a way to perform atomic changes to a visible content
Apr 19 15:04:11 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, though we can get away with a lot more for that. Since it's probably going to be a sub one second window.
Apr 19 15:04:19 <UndeadLeech>	So in theory we could probably just stop rendering completely.
Apr 19 15:04:27 <UndeadLeech>	Though obviously that wouldn't be ideal.
Apr 19 15:05:00 <kchibisov>	there're a lot of edge cases, but you can buffer input before calling `fn input`
Apr 19 15:05:06 <kchibisov>	and then push it all at once.
Apr 19 15:05:21 <kchibisov>	but it'll be complex.
Apr 19 15:05:49 <kchibisov>	at least we have testing clients already(tmux/mpv).
Apr 19 15:06:23 <kchibisov>	but let's go back to search
Apr 19 15:07:28 <kchibisov>	I feel like we shouldn't freeze it entirely, I was talking about stopping scrolling by changing display offset.
Apr 19 15:07:41 <kchibisov>	Just because it makes the most sense to do.
Apr 19 15:08:20 <kchibisov>	I mean fixing the viewport, but I'm fine with content update
Apr 19 15:08:23 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that's fair, if you automatically scroll up during search, you at least don't need to live re-search.
Apr 19 15:08:54 <kchibisov>	However something like search during asrw is complex.
Apr 19 15:09:13 <kchibisov>	So we can search lazy.
Apr 19 15:09:27 <UndeadLeech>	Honestly I don't think we should support drawing over content without clearing it first.
Apr 19 15:09:31 <UndeadLeech>	Like being aware that it happens, sure.
Apr 19 15:09:38 <UndeadLeech>	But I don't think our selection and search should work around it.
Apr 19 15:11:25 <kchibisov>	tmux also entirely freezes btw
Apr 19 15:11:36 <UndeadLeech>	During search/vi mode?
Apr 19 15:11:39 <kchibisov>	yeah
Apr 19 15:12:13 <kchibisov>	I'm not really sure that I like it, but I've never paid attention tbh
Apr 19 15:12:45 <UndeadLeech>	It seems to be a pretty common pattern.
Apr 19 15:12:49 <UndeadLeech>	Does it do that when selecting?
Apr 19 15:13:01 <kchibisov>	selection is part of this mode
Apr 19 15:13:14 <kchibisov>	just entering it - freezes.
Apr 19 15:13:16 <UndeadLeech>	There's also mouse selection though, right?
Apr 19 15:13:24 <kchibisov>	let me try
Apr 19 15:13:52 <kchibisov>	yeah, because it's done via this mode
Apr 19 15:14:02 <kchibisov>	And you can't have live selection in tmux
Apr 19 15:14:12 <UndeadLeech>	Why not?
Apr 19 15:14:18 <kchibisov>	ask them?
Apr 19 15:14:24 <UndeadLeech>	:P
Apr 19 15:15:01 <UndeadLeech>	But yeah, you're right. It always freezes.
Apr 19 15:15:15 <kchibisov>	but imagine how you can flex with live search
Apr 19 15:15:41 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but I absolutely hate all this mess already.
Apr 19 15:16:02 <kchibisov>	it'll be like the only terminal with live search updates, etc.
Apr 19 15:16:29 <UndeadLeech>	But is that actually something anyone needs? Or does it just make things unnecessarily complicated?
Apr 19 15:16:46 <kchibisov>	I like live update in vimode
Apr 19 15:17:28 <kchibisov>	does termite freeze in vi mode?
Apr 19 15:18:01 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, in vi mode and during selection.
Apr 19 15:18:39 <kchibisov>	VTE doesn't freeze during selection
Apr 19 15:19:10 <kchibisov>	oh, nvm, it's just buggy
Apr 19 15:19:23 <UndeadLeech>	Also don't resize while in vi mode with termite.
Apr 19 15:19:31 <UndeadLeech>	It seems to be impossible to recover from that.
Apr 19 15:19:42 <kchibisov>	I don't have termite
Apr 19 15:19:49 <kchibisov>	just plain vte-2.91
Apr 19 15:20:02 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough. That doesn't have vi mode though, right?
Apr 19 15:20:06 <kchibisov>	and since I don't have a lot of xorg shit I test only vte/tmux/alacritty
Apr 19 15:20:15 <kchibisov>	right, I just test vte
Apr 19 15:21:40 <kchibisov>	Oh, can we freeze in normal mode, but not in alt-screen?
Apr 19 15:21:59 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Apr 19 15:22:18 <kchibisov>	hm, idk tbqh, it seems like alt-screen is easier to handle.
Apr 19 15:22:54 <kchibisov>	since you don't have scrollback, etc.
Apr 19 15:23:06 <kchibisov>	but I really have questions about complete freeze for vi mode.
Apr 19 15:23:10 <UndeadLeech>	I'm just not really sure what I really want, or which approach I like most. So it's tough to implement something if you don't know where you want to go with it.
Apr 19 15:25:20 <kchibisov>	The thing is that we need to support complete freeze somehow for sync updates.
Apr 19 15:25:43 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that's not really something I worry about, since it's something concrete that has a clear solution.
Apr 19 15:25:58 <UndeadLeech>	If I know that's what I want to do, implementing it is just a matter of executing it.
Apr 19 15:26:04 <kchibisov>	I don't have a solution for it.
Apr 19 15:26:15 <kchibisov>	like you should do it fast.
Apr 19 15:26:22 <UndeadLeech>	Though I would like to skip buffering.
Apr 19 15:26:38 <kchibisov>	The thing is that you should have this pending buffer.
Apr 19 15:26:43 <kchibisov>	and draw old synced buffer
Apr 19 15:26:56 <kchibisov>	so it's purely terminal freeze problem.
Apr 19 15:27:35 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that'll never happen unless we handle selection separately.
Apr 19 15:27:56 <kchibisov>	like if you have BSU CONTENT_1 ESU BSU CONTENT_2 .. . You should be able to draw CONTENT_1 while you're in CONTENT_2
Apr 19 15:28:50 <kchibisov>	assuming you don't have time between or you've skipped transition from ESU -> BSU
Apr 19 15:29:05 <UndeadLeech>	Like if the buffer written is small enough, it shouldn't matter anyways.
Apr 19 15:29:15 <kchibisov>	however you can in theory just lock temrinal and force trigger redraw
Apr 19 15:29:27 <kchibisov>	terminal*
Apr 19 15:29:34 <kchibisov>	I mean after ESU
Apr 19 15:30:14 <kchibisov>	but you can do that only in ESU -> BSU
Apr 19 15:30:30 <UndeadLeech>	I really don't see much of a problem with this.
Apr 19 15:30:31 <kchibisov>	and if you won't be able to redraw fast enough
Apr 19 15:30:43 <kchibisov>	I mean performance, etc.
Apr 19 15:30:56 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think it will be problematic tbh.
Apr 19 15:31:03 <kchibisov>	ok
Apr 19 15:31:41 <kchibisov>	but it's just a matter of trying different things, since all of the are +- concrete
Apr 19 15:32:25 <kchibisov>	I'm really unsure about losing live update for vi mode, and freezing for every selection.
Apr 19 15:33:00 <UndeadLeech>	I'm unsure about everything related to vi mode and selection basically.
Apr 19 15:33:43 <UndeadLeech>	Like I've got search with highlighting all matches mostly working, but I don't know about clearing and rotation.
Apr 19 15:33:50 <UndeadLeech>	Or resize.
Apr 19 15:34:19 <kchibisov>	Well in theory it's not a big problem with your reflow PR
Apr 19 15:34:43 <UndeadLeech>	Having to reflow all matches seems like a waste though.
Apr 19 15:34:59 <kchibisov>	escapcially if you reflow each character
Apr 19 15:35:13 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it would be two points for every match.
Apr 19 15:35:27 <kchibisov>	Imagine reflowing `.`
Apr 19 15:35:39 <kchibisov>	with all matches
Apr 19 15:37:20 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, pretty much.
Apr 19 15:37:32 <kchibisov>	and then you do it in asrw and start resizing.
Apr 19 15:37:57 <UndeadLeech>	That's why I've been wondering if it's even worth it to merge reflow in the current state.
Apr 19 15:38:06 <UndeadLeech>	Or if we just shouldn't reflow vi cursor and selection.
Apr 19 15:43:59 <kchibisov>	I mean you need reflow selection.
Apr 19 15:44:04 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Apr 19 15:44:40 <kchibisov>	if you resize frozen content you should reflow selection as well
Apr 19 15:45:20 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Apr 19 15:45:21 <kchibisov>	and selection should be visible in general, like it's now.
Apr 19 15:45:43 <kchibisov>	I mean I don't want selection like in tmux tbh
Apr 19 15:45:59 <UndeadLeech>	But why?
Apr 19 15:46:07 <kchibisov>	idk, preference
Apr 19 15:46:16 <kchibisov>	like it feels weird in tmux to use its selection
Apr 19 15:46:21 <kchibisov>	and I never use it due to that
Apr 19 15:46:24 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but there has to be some logical reason to it.
Apr 19 15:46:44 <kchibisov>	there's no logical reason behind it.
Apr 19 15:47:16 <UndeadLeech>	I mean then that doesn't help.
Apr 19 15:47:20 <kchibisov>	I just like to see my selection on screen to highlight stuff from time to time.
Apr 19 15:47:39 <kchibisov>	And I use it to highlight stuff for others from time to time.
Apr 19 15:47:48 <kchibisov>	with tmux selection it's impossible.
Apr 19 15:49:09 <kchibisov>	And most terminals are showing you selection and live updates.
Apr 19 15:49:52 <kchibisov>	like ok, VTE freezes during selection, but once I've selected, it's properly rotated.
Apr 19 15:50:11 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Apr 19 15:50:35 <UndeadLeech>	I wouldn't want to freeze permanently.
Apr 19 15:50:47 <kchibisov>	during selection process - ok.
Apr 19 15:51:11 <kchibisov>	once selection is done, and it's on screen you should reflow/rotate it.
Apr 19 15:51:26 <UndeadLeech>	Rotate it, sure. But do you need to reflow it?
Apr 19 15:51:42 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure, it was your idea initially
Apr 19 15:51:54 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, mostly because of search.
Apr 19 15:52:03 <UndeadLeech>	But I don't even know how I want that to behave.
Apr 19 15:52:10 <kchibisov>	I don't need reflow for selection 50% of the time
Apr 19 15:52:25 <UndeadLeech>	Like 90% of that reflow PR is perfectly good. The cursor moved to grid, the selection moved to terminal, all fine.
Apr 19 15:52:38 <UndeadLeech>	I just don't know about passing vi cursor and selection to the grid for reflow.
Apr 19 15:53:06 <kchibisov>	yeah, it's good, I'd like docs for pub stuff and I should check your reflow logic.
Apr 19 15:53:35 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure about field docs for all items. What we have right now is kinda terrible tbh.
Apr 19 15:53:56 <kchibisov>	I mean if something is pub, it should have docs.
Apr 19 15:54:08 <kchibisov>	that's just good practise.
Apr 19 15:54:26 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but `/// Selection\npub selection: Selection` doesn't help at all.
Apr 19 15:54:28 <kchibisov>	and clippy even has a lint for such thing
Apr 19 15:54:36 <kchibisov>	you can add more docs
Apr 19 15:55:07 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, that would probably be the way to go.
Apr 19 15:55:16 <UndeadLeech>	Write better docs, rather than remove them.
Apr 19 15:55:23 <kchibisov>	// Active terminal selection\nselection: Option<Selection>
Apr 19 15:55:38 <UndeadLeech>	That doesn't really improve anything tbh.
Apr 19 15:55:54 <UndeadLeech>	Just more words.
Apr 19 16:12:09 <UndeadLeech>	Ultimately my question was though if it's even worth it to implement search directly in Alacritty. And I'm not sure about that.
Apr 19 16:17:33 <UndeadLeech>	Though it is useful to navigate vi mode.
Apr 19 18:29:24 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: You said you use the ability to pass while in vi mode, right?
Apr 19 18:29:35 <UndeadLeech>	Is that for pasting multiple times?
Apr 19 18:48:28 <kchibisov>	it's to use simplier hotkey, like `p`.
Apr 19 18:53:17 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, fair enough.
Apr 19 18:53:53 <UndeadLeech>	It seems near impossible to do search without freezing though, since it'll basically clear itself as soon as you start it.
Apr 19 18:54:10 <UndeadLeech>	Since zsh sends a Clear::Below once the search bar goes away on confirmation.
Apr 19 18:54:33 <UndeadLeech>	And we can't partially clear search, since we cannot re-search while content is being written.

Apr 21 08:40:09 <Hamilton>	kchibisov, Thanks :D
Apr 21 08:41:28 <casperstorm>	you talked about you fixed the bold font issue kchibisov or was it a dream?
Apr 21 08:41:38 <casperstorm>	the mac os rendering issue or what not
Apr 21 08:45:05 <kchibisov>	I'm aware on how to fix it.
Apr 21 08:45:25 <casperstorm>	cool, whats the issue?
Apr 21 08:45:29 <kchibisov>	it's a macOS Mojave+ feuture/limitation
Apr 21 08:47:12 <kchibisov>	so you should set defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO right in alacritty to make it work.
Apr 21 08:47:30 <casperstorm>	yeah thought so, saw that before.
Apr 21 08:47:42 <kchibisov>	this is a global update, but it's possible to do that just for alacritty.
Apr 21 08:47:49 <kchibisov>	iterm is doing the same thing
Apr 21 08:48:37 <kchibisov>	because thin strokes requires subpixel AA, but macOS Mojave+ doesn't have it
Apr 21 08:49:32 <casperstorm>	well, it has it, just disabled if i understand correctly
Apr 21 08:50:09 <kchibisov>	So solution is to write user defaults in alacritty and enable subpixel AA
Apr 21 09:02:20 <casperstorm>	There are a few objc apis we could use, but not sure we have a graphical context to pass it.
Apr 21 09:02:36 <casperstorm>	so yes that might be the best solution what you are proposing, for now at least.
Apr 21 09:02:45 <casperstorm>	until they deprecate it.
Apr 21 09:03:09 <casperstorm>	see: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics/1456263-cgcontextsetallowsfontsubpixelqu?language=objc
Apr 21 09:09:41 <kchibisov>	we're setting them
Apr 21 09:10:06 <casperstorm>	huh? where?
Apr 21 09:10:16 <kchibisov>	The problem is that without the mentioning setting they are no-op
Apr 21 09:10:38 <kchibisov>	Once you toggle this setting, you'll see subpixel AA in alacritty
Apr 21 09:11:12 <kchibisov>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/3bfb5958bc39360aeb071055660c2509650b6a95/font/src/darwin/mod.rs#L506
Apr 21 09:11:50 <kchibisov>	so as I said, we should write NSUserDefaults, or whatever this thing is called.
Apr 21 09:22:50 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Btw, is there a reason for why this setting has been disabled globally, do you know?
Apr 21 09:22:56 <UndeadLeech>	Is there a plan to remove this?
Apr 21 09:23:53 <kchibisov>	ask apple?
Apr 21 09:24:09 <UndeadLeech>	Gotcha, just curious if you found anything.
Apr 21 09:24:18 <UndeadLeech>	Because it seems strange that every application would have to set this.
Apr 21 09:24:47 <kchibisov>	idk, maybe they assume that you use only their retina displays, since without subpixel AA the font will look like shit.
Apr 21 09:25:04 <kchibisov>	on 1080p displays, etc.
Apr 21 09:26:27 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, that's kinda what I've been thinking.
Apr 21 09:26:51 <UndeadLeech>	"Nothing other than our high dpi displays exist, so why do we need subpixel AA?"
Apr 21 09:27:18 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, retina, not high dpi. They'd never use a term they haven't standardized themselves! That would be terrible marketing!
Apr 21 09:28:27 <kchibisov>	fwiw 1080p looks like shit most of the time, so they are not far from trueth.
Apr 21 09:29:11 <kchibisov>	But overly thick font stroke is a question.
Apr 21 09:29:25 <UndeadLeech>	Eh I don't think I agree.
Apr 21 09:30:27 <kchibisov>	idk, I'm running away from 1080p, etc.
Apr 21 09:31:30 <UndeadLeech>	I mean I don't think I would get a new 24inch+ monitor with 1080p. But it's not that bad and for smaller displays it's still perfectly great.
Apr 21 09:31:41 <UndeadLeech>	Phones for example, really don't need 1440p+ for that.
Apr 21 09:32:35 <kchibisov>	I was purely about 21+ inch monitors
Apr 21 09:33:47 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough.
Apr 21 09:34:27 <kchibisov>	idc about phones, just use proper DPR and you're fine.
Apr 21 09:34:53 <kchibisov>	like 3+ DPR is a way to go for phones.

Apr 23 01:02:01 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Is it correct that you've looked into mio 0.7.0 before?
Apr 23 01:02:36 <kchibisov>	we likely don't need it, since it doesn't have level triggering
Apr 23 01:03:07 <UndeadLeech>	I mean we need it. Since it'll just build up more and more ancient depedencies we cannot update.
Apr 23 01:03:21 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think sitting on some super outdated unmaintained version of a depedency is a good idea.
Apr 23 01:03:50 <kchibisov>	well, if you want to add level-triggering to it
Apr 23 01:04:07 <UndeadLeech>	I mean there's no intention to use level triggering. You should do that yourself with mio 0.7.0.
Apr 23 01:04:45 <kchibisov>	it's just wrong.
Apr 23 01:04:54 <UndeadLeech>	How so?
Apr 23 01:05:41 <kchibisov>	level triggering is default on epoll
Apr 23 01:06:08 <kchibisov>	and is done by kernel
Apr 23 01:06:22 <kchibisov>	why the fuck should I do that myself?
Apr 23 01:06:37 <UndeadLeech>	Are you aware of why it was removed? Was it because of Windows?
Apr 23 01:06:49 <kchibisov>	have no idea.
Apr 23 01:07:02 <kchibisov>	but sctk gave up on that
Apr 23 01:07:03 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's either macOS or Windows, which we both need to support.
Apr 23 01:07:16 <kchibisov>	on macOS you have kqueue
Apr 23 01:07:29 <kchibisov>	on linux you have epoll
Apr 23 01:07:37 <kchibisov>	on bsd you have kqueue
Apr 23 01:07:54 <kchibisov>	so you should figure out what we have on windows
Apr 23 01:08:16 <kchibisov>	so macOS/linux isn't a problem here
Apr 23 01:10:17 <kchibisov>	Also, if you need some polling, https://github.com/Smithay/calloop/blob/master/src/sys/mod.rs calloop already has impls for epoll/kqueue
Apr 23 01:10:44 <kchibisov>	so in theory you can extract that code into a lib.
Apr 23 01:13:35 <UndeadLeech>	We still need to work on Windows.
Apr 23 01:13:50 <UndeadLeech>	Which I'd assume is the reason for this API.
Apr 23 01:14:07 <kchibisov>	I mean we're working somehow right now
Apr 23 01:14:56 <kchibisov>	So porting old mio code into new lib isn't a problem, I guess.
Apr 23 01:15:13 <UndeadLeech>	I mean the problem's not with not working, but with overhead according to mio.
Apr 23 01:15:30 <kchibisov>	on Windows?
Apr 23 01:15:41 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't state that, but I'd assume so.
Apr 23 01:15:56 <kchibisov>	maybe mio is too network oriented
Apr 23 01:16:10 <kchibisov>	like it was impossible to use it in sctk.
Apr 23 01:16:22 <kchibisov>	was just broken.
Apr 23 01:16:26 <UndeadLeech>	https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/issues/928
Apr 23 01:16:29 <kchibisov>	due to edge-triggering
Apr 23 01:20:46 <kchibisov>	so they said - they are broken, and called it a day? wtf
Apr 23 01:22:01 <kchibisov>	I mean whatever, but it already proved that it's impossible to use edge-triggering, unless you want to have lost events all the time.
Apr 23 01:22:27 <UndeadLeech>	I mean they support all kinds of shit including Solaris.
Apr 23 01:22:37 <UndeadLeech>	I don't know which of their supported platforms has problems.
Apr 23 01:22:50 <UndeadLeech>	It seems macOs has problems with oneshot, but I don't know about level.
Apr 23 01:23:21 <kchibisov>	you mean macOS/BSD?
Apr 23 01:23:30 <kchibisov>	since kqueue isn't not macOS only
Apr 23 01:23:36 <kchibisov>	s/not//
Apr 23 01:23:37 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah. The issue was just about macOS.
Apr 23 01:23:44 <UndeadLeech>	Who knows how they managed to break kqueue.
Apr 23 01:24:03 <UndeadLeech>	https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/issues/911#issuecomment-465619538
Apr 23 01:26:43 <kchibisov>	it seems like they should use EV_DISPATCH instead of EV_ONESHOT?
Apr 23 01:27:10 <UndeadLeech>	I don't know, this is about oneshot, not level. Which seems far easier to work around.
Apr 23 01:27:26 <kchibisov>	I was also talking about oneshot right now.
Apr 23 01:28:26 <kchibisov>	Also, I don't want to debug edge-triggering issues, just saying.
Apr 23 01:29:42 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Apr 23 01:29:54 <UndeadLeech>	You don't want to deal with maintaining it yourself?
Apr 23 01:30:16 <kchibisov>	I mean, I had enough of missing events when writting sctk app.
Apr 23 01:30:36 <UndeadLeech>	That doesn't seem like it would be a problem.
Apr 23 01:32:16 <kchibisov>	I mean, I don't want to use mio 0.7.0
Apr 23 01:32:25 <UndeadLeech>	Because?
Apr 23 01:32:45 <kchibisov>	because it doesn't have level-triggering
Apr 23 01:32:56 <UndeadLeech>	Which we could work around.
Apr 23 01:33:05 <kchibisov>	how?
Apr 23 01:33:28 <kchibisov>	do you want to do kernel's job?
Apr 23 01:33:32 <UndeadLeech>	By looping around all I/O operations?
Apr 23 01:33:38 <kchibisov>	I'd rather trust kernel
Apr 23 01:33:49 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see how this is about 'trust'.
Apr 23 01:34:02 <kchibisov>	I mean it'll be faster if kernel does that for us
Apr 23 01:34:04 <UndeadLeech>	If your loop fails there are more serious issues going on than level or edge.
Apr 23 01:34:13 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure if it will.
Apr 23 01:34:48 <UndeadLeech>	I would be very careful with statements like that without actually having benchmarked it.
Apr 23 01:35:09 <kchibisov>	I mean there's a reason why libevent exists
Apr 23 01:35:49 <UndeadLeech>	Which isn't because the existence of level means that 0.6 is faster than 0.7.
Apr 23 01:36:22 <UndeadLeech>	libevent would also exist even if level wasn't a thing tbh.
Apr 23 01:36:43 <kchibisov>	I mean what's the use case behind edge?
Apr 23 01:36:56 <kchibisov>	I mean `for` edge?
Apr 23 01:37:06 <UndeadLeech>	Cross-platform support it seems?
Apr 23 01:37:35 <kchibisov>	yeah, yeah, but you have select(3)?
Apr 23 01:37:43 <UndeadLeech>	So?
Apr 23 01:37:58 <kchibisov>	it's on every platform
Apr 23 01:38:42 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that's not really the case, but I don't see how that's relevant.
Apr 23 01:38:47 <kchibisov>	since it's POSIX
Apr 23 01:38:55 <UndeadLeech>	Windows isn't POSIX.
Apr 23 01:39:07 <kchibisov>	Windows has something for that already
Apr 23 01:39:19 <kchibisov>	I'm just saying that you have Windows + select for everything else
Apr 23 01:39:55 <kchibisov>	And I bet you have something for that on Windows already
Apr 23 01:39:57 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see how you want to use Windows + POSIX select to support level triggering.
Apr 23 01:40:20 <kchibisov>	I mean that you use special API on Windows and select on each otehr platform.
Apr 23 01:41:33 <UndeadLeech>	So you want to emulate level triggering on platforms that don't support it, like mio previously did?
Apr 23 01:41:52 <kchibisov>	Windows doesn't have level triggering at all?
Apr 23 01:43:00 <UndeadLeech>	I don't know which platform is the cause of this.
Apr 23 01:43:05 <UndeadLeech>	Might be iOS for all I know.
Apr 23 01:43:12 <kchibisov>	it has kqueue
Apr 23 01:43:27 <UndeadLeech>	Yes, but that's not the point.
Apr 23 01:43:31 <UndeadLeech>	The point is that I can't tell you.
Apr 23 01:43:38 <kchibisov>	android should have epoll
Apr 23 01:44:18 <UndeadLeech>	There's no point in making guesses, but according to mio it seems that the cross-platform level abstraction resulted in overhead.
Apr 23 01:44:32 <kchibisov>	ok, ok.
Apr 23 01:44:37 <UndeadLeech>	So it's possible that switching to edge triggering would improve performance.
Apr 23 01:44:52 <kchibisov>	and lost events.
Apr 23 01:46:09 <UndeadLeech>	Why would it lead to lost events?
Apr 23 01:46:25 <kchibisov>	man epoll
Apr 23 01:46:35 <kchibisov>	Level-triggered and edge-triggered
Apr 23 01:47:22 <kchibisov>	man 7 epoll to be more precise
Apr 23 01:47:41 <UndeadLeech>	What about it?
Apr 23 01:48:16 <kchibisov>	I mean it has an example who you can lose events.
Apr 23 01:48:23 <kchibisov>	s/who/how
Apr 23 01:51:11 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see what you mean.
Apr 23 01:51:38 <kchibisov>	I mean if you read some buffer but not fully, you'll block.
Apr 23 01:51:43 <kchibisov>	assume PTY
Apr 23 01:52:10 <kchibisov>	even if you have data in it.
Apr 23 01:53:46 <kchibisov>	from what I see that is exactly what we can end up with?
Apr 23 01:54:22 <UndeadLeech>	We already do not use level for PTY reads.
Apr 23 01:54:45 <UndeadLeech>	Actually nvm.
Apr 23 01:54:46 <kchibisov>	Oh, so maybe our X11 issue is due to that?
Apr 23 01:54:59 <UndeadLeech>	Nvm that nvm, for the PTY itself we don't use it.
Apr 23 01:55:06 <UndeadLeech>	We use it related to PTYs, but not for reading it.
Apr 23 01:55:24 <UndeadLeech>	Due to what?
Apr 23 01:55:49 <kchibisov>	I mean if we've used edge on PTY read, I see how we can miss something.
Apr 23 01:55:49 <UndeadLeech>	You mean because we don't always read until Interrupted | WouldBlock, but stop on MAX_BYTES?
Apr 23 01:55:52 <kchibisov>	but I don't see edge
Apr 23 01:56:18 <UndeadLeech>	It's PollOpt::edge() | PollOpt::oneshot().
Apr 23 01:57:29 <UndeadLeech>	IIRC I've already tried removing the MAX_READ condition to fix this though.
Apr 23 01:57:51 <kchibisov>	have you tried PollOpt::level()?
Apr 23 01:58:13 <UndeadLeech>	I mean without MAX_READ there shouldn't be any problem.
Apr 23 01:58:31 <UndeadLeech>	You do mean that the problem could be that we don't read everything and then don't get woken up again, right?
Apr 23 01:58:38 <kchibisov>	kind of
Apr 23 01:58:50 <kchibisov>	so your poll will block infinitely
Apr 23 01:59:04 <kchibisov>	However from what I remember that wasn't the problem
Apr 23 01:59:20 <kchibisov>	the problem was that we won't be able to wakeup in some edge case
Apr 23 01:59:36 <kchibisov>	however wakeup event should wakeup winit, which is also using mio
Apr 23 01:59:48 <UndeadLeech>	If we don't read all the bytes, we won't get woken up again untill the next EAGAIN when using edge triggers.
Apr 23 02:00:22 <UndeadLeech>	If you're talking about the PTY, though I'm not sure you are.
Apr 23 02:00:23 <kchibisov>	yeah, but I don't know into what mio translates it.
Apr 23 02:00:51 <kchibisov>	from my experience I've never got a wake up with edge.
Apr 23 02:01:04 <kchibisov>	like reading wayland display was infinite block with edge for me, most of the time.
Apr 23 02:01:35 <kchibisov>	unless I've flushed fd.
Apr 23 02:01:40 <kchibisov>	from other thread
Apr 23 02:01:59 <UndeadLeech>	If that was the case, Alacritty wouldn't work.
Apr 23 02:02:06 <UndeadLeech>	Like at all.
Apr 23 02:02:36 <kchibisov>	I mean likely, I don't know our setup for mio, maybe it's fine.
Apr 23 02:04:13 <kchibisov>	but the only thing I haven't tried is using level.
Apr 23 02:04:29 <UndeadLeech>	For wayland stuff you mean?
Apr 23 02:04:40 <kchibisov>	For wayland stuff mio was already removed.
Apr 23 02:04:50 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean then?
Apr 23 02:05:05 <kchibisov>	I mean for our X11 bug.
Apr 23 02:05:20 <kchibisov>	but I feel like it's winit problem, since it loses events.
Apr 23 02:05:29 <kchibisov>	somehow, but loses.
Apr 23 02:05:47 <UndeadLeech>	You mean https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/824? Why is this X11 specific?
Apr 23 02:06:08 <kchibisov>	was only reproduced on X11.
Apr 23 02:06:28 <kchibisov>	and reported on X11 as well.
Apr 23 02:06:51 <UndeadLeech>	I mean I'm using X11 and I can't repro it at all.
Apr 23 02:06:57 <kchibisov>	you've done it once.
Apr 23 02:07:01 <UndeadLeech>	Might just be that more people are using X11?
Apr 23 02:07:09 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure if I've reproed this bug or the other one tbh.
Apr 23 02:07:15 <UndeadLeech>	I wouldn't trust anything I've said about reproing it.
Apr 23 02:07:47 <kchibisov>	you've reproduced it this summer with weechat.
Apr 23 02:08:22 <UndeadLeech>	I've reproduced the issue fixed by evlp2 with weechat.
Apr 23 02:08:27 <UndeadLeech>	I don't know about 824.
Apr 23 02:08:38 <kchibisov>	no, it was 824
Apr 23 02:09:02 <kchibisov>	since I've reproduced the same issue on master shortly after with tmux
Apr 23 02:09:11 <UndeadLeech>	I have absolutely zero evidence that I was actually able to reproduce this bug.
Apr 23 02:09:12 <kchibisov>	and on evlp2 branch
Apr 23 02:09:20 <kchibisov>	I have logs.
Apr 23 02:09:22 <UndeadLeech>	I've never been able to reproduce it before evlp2 and have never seen it since.
Apr 23 02:09:33 <kchibisov>	me neither.
Apr 23 02:09:34 <UndeadLeech>	You have logs of me thinking I might have reproduced it.
Apr 23 02:09:41 <UndeadLeech>	But I have never been able to confirm it.
Apr 23 02:10:07 <kchibisov>	likely, but the issue you've described was exactly 824.
Apr 23 02:10:14 <UndeadLeech>	It could have been a networking problem for all I know.
Apr 23 02:10:29 <UndeadLeech>	Or I ran the wrong branch.
Apr 23 02:10:53 <kchibisov>	and since we know that winit can lose events, maybe there's something.
Apr 23 02:11:49 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but that's likely because winit might be doing something stupid.
Apr 23 02:12:20 <UndeadLeech>	Like as far as I know, we use edge just fine and that can actually help with performance.
Apr 23 02:13:04 <kchibisov>	likely, since from what I've seen the issue wasn't with us polling and sending wakeups.
Apr 23 02:13:30 <kchibisov>	sending wakeup to winit could unfreeze us, but it had nothing to do with pty reading.
Apr 23 02:14:19 <UndeadLeech>	My latest understanding about it was that winit wakeups were dropped, especially in the visual bell bug that seemed to be the case.
Apr 23 02:14:30 <UndeadLeech>	But the details got very hazy once winit introduced another bug that was so similar.
Apr 23 02:15:10 <UndeadLeech>	But the visual bell problem itself can't possibly be due to PTY, so that makes winit a more likely target.
Apr 23 02:16:19 <UndeadLeech>	I'll mark both issues as X11-only for now, maybe that'll trigger some more input if anyone ever actually managed to repro on Wayland.
Apr 23 02:16:40 <kchibisov>	visual bell was on macOS as well
Apr 23 02:16:48 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, really?
Apr 23 02:16:52 <kchibisov>	yes
Apr 23 02:16:57 <UndeadLeech>	Indeed.
Apr 23 02:17:03 <UndeadLeech>	So maybe it is about more than just X11.
Apr 23 02:17:54 <UndeadLeech>	Then I'll remove the tags, but I'd still like to know if anyone was able to repro 824 on non-wayland.
Apr 23 02:18:10 <UndeadLeech>	But that seems to be pretty conclusive evidence that something funky might be going on with more than just x11.
Apr 23 02:18:26 <UndeadLeech>	Like that seems to show that winit swallows wakeups on multiple platforms.
Apr 23 02:39:31 <UndeadLeech>	Oh god damn it. Someone updated their stuff again breaking our build.
Apr 23 02:41:04 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, but we can update to 1.41.0.

Apr 23 07:52:52 <Levanx>	about mio, if I understand correctly the main difficulty they meet with Windows is that it's selector system is completion-based, rather than readiness-based, and that this is the main source of overhead in mio on Windows.
Apr 23 07:53:12 <Levanx>	Not completely sure how it translates to edge/level triggering though
Apr 23 08:05:17 <casperstorm>	UndeadLeech: thanks for the feedback in the utf8/locale PR. let me know if you wanna discuss anything over irc.

Apr 23 10:22:09 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: Ah okay, so can you confirm this edge/level thing is actually about Windows?
Apr 23 10:22:54 <Levanx>	I'm not sure, but afaik this windows thing has always be the pain point for mio
Apr 23 10:23:09 <UndeadLeech>	Seems like it's very likely then, yeah.
Apr 23 10:23:34 <UndeadLeech>	I just named Windows as my best guess for what is causing the problem, to be fair that wouldn't be very surprising.
Apr 23 10:23:51 <UndeadLeech>	Though once they move their kernel to Linux that should all hopefully be fixed. :)
Apr 23 10:23:53 <UndeadLeech>	Any moment now.
Apr 23 10:27:20 <UndeadLeech>	casperstorm: I'm not 100% certain how to best approach this tbh. We could just check environment variable, but that would break setups where locale magically works.
Apr 23 10:27:22 <Levanx>	Looking at the issues, it looks like it was actually linked to macos kqueue
Apr 23 10:27:38 <UndeadLeech>	That was about oneshot though, no mention of level problems with kqueue.
Apr 23 10:28:14 <Levanx>	But it looks a lot to me like mio's maintainer got fet up with trying to maintain cross-platform compatibility and decided to focus on the only use that really mattered to them : edge-triggers to scalable web apps
Apr 23 10:28:30 <casperstorm>	I think the only case we dont support right now is launching alacritty from terminal - most(?) cases should be handled now, tho.
Apr 23 10:28:30 <Levanx>	maintainers *
Apr 23 10:30:46 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: I mean if there are problems with it on Windows, that has an effect on more than just webapps.
Apr 23 10:32:29 <Levanx>	I mean, they are considering bringing level&oneshot back, just not on a cross-platform way : https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio/issues/1049
Apr 23 10:33:52 <Levanx>	I really don't know much about what mio does with windows. But I think they are basically emulating an epoll-like api, so probably thay can do whatever they want at this point ?
Apr 23 10:34:28 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, so that seems a lot more like giving up on cross-platform support for it, than giving up on supporting it. Which makes it seems unlikely that the only reason is that they don't care about it at all.
Apr 23 10:36:00 <Levanx>	Well, looks like their initial point of view was "everything can be emulated using edge triggers so we'll just focus on that"
Apr 23 10:36:22 <UndeadLeech>	I mean for you it probably doesn't matter, but Alacritty has to support Windows anyways. Though I think we just use `level` on unix...
Apr 23 10:36:37 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: I mean that's not wrong, is it?
Apr 23 10:37:36 <Levanx>	Well, only if you assume that you won't have the same socket monitored by several mostly independent event loops.
Apr 23 10:37:58 <Levanx>	Which can be a convenient thing to do for multithreaded wayland apps
Apr 23 10:39:01 <Levanx>	If you monitor the wayland socket with multiple event loops, hen it becomes readable, level trigger wakes them all, while edge-trigger only wakes one
Apr 23 10:39:55 <UndeadLeech>	Using multiple indepedently registered SourceFd sources?
Apr 23 10:40:35 <Levanx>	Yeah.
Apr 23 10:40:48 <Levanx>	That's just how epoll works
Apr 23 10:40:52 <UndeadLeech>	Or are you just not reading all of it and relying on level triggering to wake you up again until you'd block?
Apr 23 10:41:15 <Levanx>	and an other issue we encountered with smithay is that when you register an epoll fd into an other epoll instance, some weirf things can happen when using edge-triggers
Apr 23 10:42:03 <Levanx>	Well, if I have two event loops waiting on the same client wayland socket (using a different event queue), it's very likely that when the socket becomes readable, it'll contain events for both
Apr 23 10:42:34 <Levanx>	so both need to wake up and process their events (even if only one will actually read them from the socket)
Apr 23 10:43:17 <UndeadLeech>	I'm just wondering if level triggering really woke up both initially, or if it just woke up the other one because the socket wasn't drained.
Apr 23 10:43:33 <Levanx>	kchibisov encountered issues ith smithay-clipboard due to exactly that
Apr 23 10:45:33 <Levanx>	I think it's part of the specification of epoll's level-triggered mode that all waiting epoll are woken up
Apr 23 10:45:34 <Levanx>	let me check
Apr 23 10:46:29 <UndeadLeech>	Also have you tried the new unix socket APIs?
Apr 23 10:46:37 <UndeadLeech>	Those are already specific to unix, maybe that would work?
Apr 23 10:47:00 <Levanx>	the "new" unix socket api ?
Apr 23 10:47:11 <Levanx>	Though I'm bound to using the sockets that libwayland uses
Apr 23 10:48:17 <UndeadLeech>	It seems to be very networking focused, I'm not actually quite sure if they're meant to be used for anything else.
Apr 23 10:49:08 <Levanx>	which api are you talking about?
Apr 23 10:50:42 <UndeadLeech>	https://docs.rs/mio/0.7.0/mio/net/index.html
Apr 23 10:51:09 <UndeadLeech>	Also you're correct, edge triggering will intentionally wakeup only one thread as an optimization.
Apr 23 10:51:11 <Levanx>	Ah, mio's API
Apr 23 10:51:30 <UndeadLeech>	Oh yeah, sorry I didn't mention that part. :D
Apr 23 10:52:13 <UndeadLeech>	Though it does say that this is the case if multiple threads have inherited the same epoll file descriptor.
Apr 23 10:52:14 <Levanx>	Actually I'm using directly nix, because I need to sendmsg/recvsmg with auxilliary data, to pass file descriptors between client & server
Apr 23 10:52:25 <UndeadLeech>	Fair enough.
Apr 23 10:53:56 <Levanx>	(and when using the system libwayland, it's it that does that)
Apr 23 10:54:19 <Levanx>	I'm just monitoring the socket to know when I should call libwayland's functions to process events
Apr 23 10:58:41 <UndeadLeech>	It seems like this is a common problem though: https://idea.popcount.org/2017-02-20-epoll-is-fundamentally-broken-12/
Apr 23 10:59:47 <UndeadLeech>	Do you know if mio automatically makes level triggering exclusive?
Apr 23 11:00:42 <Levanx>	Well, mio 0.7 does not do level triggering at all, so...
Apr 23 11:00:45 <UndeadLeech>	Old mio that is. :P
Apr 23 11:06:30 <Levanx>	Don't know tbh. Decided to ditch it completely, allowed me to drastically reduce the dependencies of calloop :p
Apr 23 11:07:02 <UndeadLeech>	Oh I mean that's certainly the way to go.
Apr 23 11:07:05 <UndeadLeech>	What do you do now?
Apr 23 11:07:38 <Levanx>	directly call into epoll / kqueue
Apr 23 11:07:46 <Levanx>	I don't really care about windows support tbh ^^"
Apr 23 11:08:16 <UndeadLeech>	Wasn't calloop cross-platform before?
Apr 23 11:09:25 <Levanx>	kind of ? It wasn't really usable on platforms not relying on FDs
Apr 23 11:10:30 <UndeadLeech>	Hm, might be good to state that. Also the README needs an update.
Apr 23 11:11:11 <Levanx>	at, that's possible
Apr 23 11:11:26 <UndeadLeech>	I hope so. :)
Apr 23 11:20:49 <casperstorm>	UndeadLeech: indeed, was a bit confused by locale and env variables. I am unsure how I can move this forward if you are questioning the functionality of it.
Apr 23 11:26:12 <UndeadLeech>	Could check if the environment variable is set?
Apr 23 11:29:02 <casperstorm>	can i use env::var("LC_CTYPE")?
Apr 23 11:29:50 <UndeadLeech>	I can give it a try later. But you can check if a variable is set with env::var, yes.
Apr 23 11:30:31 <casperstorm>	let me just update the code and you can give me feedback again?
Apr 23 11:30:47 <UndeadLeech>	Sure.
Apr 23 12:32:21 <casperstorm>	UndeadLeech: i've updated the PR now, let me know what you think.
Apr 23 12:49:08 <eoli3n_>	Hi
Apr 23 12:49:12 <eoli3n_>	is there a way to add inside padding ?
Apr 23 12:49:26 <UndeadLeech>	Like the window.padding config option?
Apr 23 12:50:27 <eoli3n_>	i tried that
Apr 23 12:50:34 <eoli3n_>	it doesnt change internal padding
Apr 23 12:50:43 <UndeadLeech>	How does it not?
Apr 23 12:50:56 <eoli3n_>	i think it applies to "window" but i use a tilling window manager
Apr 23 12:51:03 <eoli3n_>	lets retry
Apr 23 12:51:11 <UndeadLeech>	It definitely doesn't.
Apr 23 12:51:20 <eoli3n_>	ah my bad
Apr 23 12:51:28 <eoli3n_>	miss to uncomment a line
Apr 23 12:51:55 <basic>	is there a way to have the font size adjust itself to the screensize?
Apr 23 12:52:02 <basic>	or does this not make sense at all?
Apr 23 12:52:21 <kchibisov>	it's done by default based on your DPR
Apr 23 12:52:36 <basic>	what does R stand for?
Apr 23 12:52:41 <Yaniel>	ratio
Apr 23 12:52:50 <Yaniel>	(Display Pixel Ratio)
Apr 23 12:53:05 <basic>	i see, but on my laptop it varies to hard that it is annoying me :/
Apr 23 12:53:09 <basic>	so that is just me?
Apr 23 12:53:21 <Yaniel>	then you need to fix your laptop's configuration
Apr 23 12:53:33 <Yaniel>	to report the correct DPR for each display
Apr 23 12:53:50 <kchibisov>	yeah, if it's X11 you should make xrandr report saner values
Apr 23 12:54:17 <basic>	how can i check those values?
Apr 23 12:54:24 <kchibisov>	Also, the same is the same physically, not in pixels.
Apr 23 12:54:29 <Yaniel>	xrandr
Apr 23 12:54:36 <basic>	okway, my laptop screen seems not to report the screen size
Apr 23 12:54:41 <basic>	HDMI-A-0 connected 3440x1440+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 797mm x 333mm
Apr 23 12:54:52 <kchibisov>	797mm x 333mm
Apr 23 12:54:55 <basic>	eDP connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 173mm
Apr 23 12:55:02 <kchibisov>	309mm x 173mm
Apr 23 12:55:03 <basic>	well, it does
Apr 23 12:55:20 <Yaniel>	is it correct though?
Apr 23 12:55:29 <kchibisov>	seems like it tbh
Apr 23 12:55:35 <basic>	yes
Apr 23 12:55:39 <Yaniel>	and yeah, alacritty tries to keep font size the same in mm, not in pixels
Apr 23 12:56:12 <basic>	so it looks so "zoomed" to be because my laptop is too small
Apr 23 12:56:20 <basic>	solution: get rich and have a portable beamerh
Apr 23 12:56:23 <basic>	?
Apr 23 12:56:48 <Yaniel>	?
Apr 23 12:56:52 <kchibisov>	?
Apr 23 12:57:16 <basic>	so if i measure AAAAAAAAAAAAA on my big screen
Apr 23 12:57:19 <kchibisov>	run `alacritty --print-events | grep -i scale` and move your window across the screens
Apr 23 12:57:27 <basic>	it should be as big as equivalent thing on laptop screen?
Apr 23 12:57:44 <Yaniel>	it should yes
Apr 23 12:58:00 <Yaniel>	try what kchibisov suggested, it should print an event when the window moves to the other screen
Apr 23 12:58:08 <basic>	[2020-04-23 13:58:33.617366770] [INFO] glutin event: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(X(WindowId(117440514))), event: ScaleFactorChanged { scale_factor: 1.6666666666666667, new_inner_size: PhysicalSize { width: 1143, height: 857 } } }
Apr 23 12:58:16 <basic>	[2020-04-23 13:58:34.865588052] [INFO] glutin event: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(X(WindowId(117440514))), event: ScaleFactorChanged { scale_factor: 1.1666666666666667, new_inner_size: PhysicalSize { width: 800, height: 600 } } }
Apr 23 12:58:44 <basic>	that looks correct i guess
Apr 23 12:59:22 <kchibisov>	and font should be the samw physically then
Apr 23 13:02:29 <kchibisov>	you can have fixed scale factor like all other apps by using Xft.dpi: 96 settin in xresources
Apr 23 13:02:41 <basic>	oh, okay, cool thanks

Apr 23 18:32:16 <fixel->	hi, trying to run alacritty on macos (installed via homebrew) but no modifier shortcuts seem to work (C-a or C-c or C-d) -- any ideas what's going on?
Apr 23 18:33:08 <fixel->	(i do see the keypresses when using --print-events, does that mean i need to map them somehow?)
Apr 23 18:34:14 <Yaniel>	yes you need to map them to something in your config file
Apr 23 18:34:35 <kchibisov>	you shoulnd't if it's C - c /C - dd
Apr 23 18:34:39 <kchibisov>	C-d*
Apr 23 18:35:01 <kchibisov>	What are you expecting them to do?
Apr 23 18:35:37 <Yaniel>	yeah for most shortcuts you should use Command instead of Control as per macOS convention
Apr 23 18:35:54 <Yaniel>	and because Control-c etc have special meanings in terminal emulators
Apr 23 18:36:18 <fixel->	i'd expect C-d to terminate the running shell, C-c to "interrupt" and stop the current prompt, starting a new one
Apr 23 18:36:25 <kchibisov>	they should work?
Apr 23 18:36:33 <kchibisov>	you don't have to bind them.
Apr 23 18:37:55 <kchibisov>	Do you see something when you try `C-d` into `cat`?
Apr 23 18:39:56 <fixel->	my best guess at what the corresponding event for `C-d` is when using --print-events: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(Id(140477264353008)), event: KeyboardInput { device_id: DeviceId(DeviceId), input: KeyboardInput { scancode: 62, state: Released, virtual_keycode: Some(RControl), modifiers: (empty) }, is_synthetic: false } }
Apr 23 18:40:30 <kchibisov>	Can you try `LControl`?
Apr 23 18:40:40 <cole-h>	There's a difference between RControl and LControl AFAIK
Apr 23 18:40:41 <fixel->	in alacritty i get a `d` (rather than terminating cat)
Apr 23 18:41:26 <kchibisov>	I mean who knows what macOS does here, but I don't have a keyboard with RControl.
Apr 23 18:41:35 <fixel->	for lcontrol: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(Id(140719080954656)), event: KeyboardInput { device_id: DeviceId(DeviceId), input: KeyboardInput { scancode: 59, state: Released, virtual_keycode: Some(LControl), modifiers: (empty) }, is_synthetic: false } }
Apr 23 18:41:46 <kchibisov>	I mean does binding with LControl works?
Apr 23 18:41:49 <cole-h>	But does LControl work as you expect RControlto?
Apr 23 18:42:45 <fixel->	sorry, not sure what you guys mean: @kchibisov do you mean that i should bind LControl in alacritty.yml?
Apr 23 18:43:08 <kchibisov>	I mean does LControl + C/D works?
Apr 23 18:43:10 <fixel->	@cole-h they have the same effect in other terminal emulators for me (iterm2 and terminal.app)
Apr 23 18:43:11 <kchibisov>	when you just press them.
Apr 23 18:43:51 <fixel->	kchibisov: in alacritty neither lcontrol nor rcontrol + d work as i expect them to
Apr 23 18:44:19 <kchibisov>	Can you share the entire `alacritty --print-events` log?
Apr 23 18:44:30 <kchibisov>	while you're reproducing the issue.
Apr 23 18:44:47 <kchibisov>	Also, what keyboard layout are you using?
Apr 23 18:44:56 <kchibisov>	And what alacritty version
Apr 23 18:45:16 <kchibisov>	you can get version information with `alacritty --version`
Apr 23 18:47:38 <fixel->	https://pastebin.com/vvGLccab
Apr 23 18:48:40 <fixel->	keyboard layout is workman, alacritty version 0.4.2 f68de37
Apr 23 18:49:15 <kchibisov>	Oh, that's likely the issue.
Apr 23 18:49:25 <fixel->	the keyboard layout?
Apr 23 18:49:31 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Apr 23 18:49:58 <fixel->	re pastebin: i started alacritty, hit C-d (which prints d) and then Cmd-Q to quit alacritty
Apr 23 18:50:15 <kchibisov>	yeah, I read pastebin, it seems like we're not getting proper char.
Apr 23 18:50:36 <kchibisov>	It's not some predefined layout on macOS, right?
Apr 23 18:51:59 <fixel->	yep (not pre-defined) and yep - when i change to qwerty C-d and friends work
Apr 23 18:52:21 <fixel->	any idea on how to approach this?
Apr 23 18:52:31 <kchibisov>	IIRC dvorak/etc works, how did you setup your layout?
Apr 23 18:53:03 <kchibisov>	I mean they work without special bindings, etc.
Apr 23 18:53:28 <fixel->	started out with this: https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/tree/master/mac
Apr 23 18:58:33 <kchibisov>	I guess this is somehow related https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/issues/13
Apr 23 18:59:11 <kchibisov>	you can define bindings for all things, but if we don't get proper chars from the os, it could be annoying
Apr 23 19:00:25 <fixel->	could be - i haven't come across it though from what I recall and i use those readline/emacs bindings a lot (also in browsers and other apps)
Apr 23 19:00:59 <fixel->	i mean C-a to jump to the start, C-k to kill, C-e to jump to the end and so on
Apr 23 19:01:28 <kchibisov>	I don't know anything about custom layouts on macOS, maybe our windowing library should do more to handle them, but since dvorak/colemak works, I'm a bit skeptical.
Apr 23 19:01:42 <kchibisov>	If the solution is to hardcode everything it's not really a solution.
Apr 23 19:02:05 <kchibisov>	But yeah, you can add bindings in alacritty.yml for Ctrl + c, etc.
Apr 23 19:02:31 <fixel->	yep - some for mapping those binding imho, as an emacs user i probably use most possible combinations of C-* ;)
Apr 23 19:02:44 <fixel->	some/same/
Apr 23 19:03:57 <fixel->	i've modified the layout some years ago, i'll try to switch to the vanilla one and see how that goes - need to log out for that, thanks for your help so far kchibisov!
Apr 23 19:05:30 <kchibisov>	I mean maybe there's something our library doesn't handle, but debugging such things could be a bit of a task.
Apr 23 19:11:06 <fixel->	same issue on the vanilla workman keyboard layout -- i'm guessing the `scanCode` is incorrect?
Apr 23 19:11:24 <fixel->	(ie 62 doesn't correspond to d)
Apr 23 19:11:32 <kchibisov>	it's not related to scanCode, etc.
Apr 23 19:11:44 <kchibisov>	OS is sending some characters with each key press.
Apr 23 19:12:07 <kchibisov>	So, it sends proper chars for, let's say Ctrl + C/D automatically on qwerty
Apr 23 19:12:23 <kchibisov>	which corresponds to proper chars for Ctrl + C/D
Apr 23 19:12:29 <kchibisov>	so we just forward them.
Apr 23 19:29:17 <fixel->	fyi looks like remapping keys via Karabiner-Elements works
Apr 23 19:40:03 <fixel->	yep - so just remapped via Karabiner Elements - and everything i've tested so far works as expected -- cheers!

Apr 24 13:06:16 <r3dux>	I have noticed that alacritty doesn't seem to adhere to my set mouse cursor.... hovering the mouse over apps like ranger and weechat in alacritty displays the default mouse cursor, as soon as the mouse leaves the terminal is goes back to my set cursor.... how to fix this?
Apr 24 13:07:16 <casperstorm>	which os?
Apr 24 13:07:48 <r3dux>	manjaro and arch... both systems seem to have the same issue.
Apr 24 13:08:31 <r3dux>	I set my cursor theme inside of lxappearance if it is relevant.
Apr 24 13:09:03 <r3dux>	casperstorm: Does this cursor need to be declared in alacritty.yml or something?
Apr 24 13:09:24 <Levanx>	x11 or Wayland?
Apr 24 13:10:22 <r3dux>	On manjaro i3 so I am assuming X though wayland does come installed in manjaro i3 for some reason
Apr 24 13:11:24 <r3dux>	Levanx: I was actually wondering why wayland comes with manjaro i3 when I was under the understanding that i3 doesnt run on wayland and that if one was using wayland they would have to go with sway instead.
Apr 24 13:12:07 <r3dux>	The wayland thing was my first thought though as I have seen there is some issues with alacritty in waylands... but i3 is X only... right??
Apr 24 13:12:30 <Levanx>	Yeah, i3 is X only
Apr 24 13:12:55 <r3dux>	Well, that solves that mystery.... wonder why wayland comes with manjaro-i3 in that case...
Apr 24 13:13:53 *	Levanx doesn't know either
Apr 24 13:14:04 <r3dux>	Anyways... is there a fix for this? I haven't had any other issues but the cursor switching back and forth is super annoying... it defaults back to the dark breeze cursor which is hard to see...
Apr 24 13:17:20 <casperstorm>	I havn't heard about this issue before, have you searched through issue on github?
Apr 24 13:18:18 <r3dux>	casperstorm: I have. All I saw were wayland issues.
Apr 24 13:18:43 <casperstorm>	I don't know a fix for it, so if no one else comes up maybe i can ask you to fill one out then ill look at it later?
Apr 24 13:19:37 <r3dux>	nomatter which cursor I choose it seems to use my os's default which is breeze snow... I thought maybe I needed to declare my set cursor in the config somewhere.
Apr 24 13:20:22 <r3dux>	casperstorm: Will do, ill submitt an issue if no one chimes in, thank you. Otherwise this terminal is awesome.

Oct 15 20:31:02 <UndeadLeech>	https://paste.rs/aFE.png
Oct 15 20:31:09 <UndeadLeech>	Looks like I might have it.
Oct 15 20:54:00 <nixpulvis>	still using the custom drop?
Oct 15 20:56:32 <UndeadLeech>	Nope, I actually managed to do it without the ManuallyDrop.
Oct 15 20:56:51 <UndeadLeech>	I think the size reduction of the Box<T> managed to get the whole cell struct small enough that cloning it is relatively efficient.
Oct 15 21:03:50 <kchibisov>	btw, have you tried using cow storage for internal buffer?
Oct 15 21:08:38 <UndeadLeech>	Why?
Oct 15 21:08:59 <UndeadLeech>	Putting a Cow in a struct seems kinda... useless?
Oct 15 21:09:18 <nixpulvis>	why?
Oct 15 21:09:42 <kchibisov>	you don't change internal buffer too much?
Oct 15 21:10:09 <UndeadLeech>	Where is it supposed to be stored?
Oct 15 21:10:15 <UndeadLeech>	What is it borrowing from?
Oct 15 21:10:25 <kchibisov>	From cursor template.
Oct 15 21:10:32 <UndeadLeech>	Hah.
Oct 15 21:10:40 <kchibisov>	Though, it could not beneficial.
Oct 15 21:11:27 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah let's reference a template cell from everywhere and then permanently change half our grid because our template cell needs to constantly change.
Oct 15 21:11:48 <UndeadLeech>	Even if one would manage to escape the lifetime hell that puts you in, it just doesn't make any sense.
Oct 15 21:12:29 <kchibisov>	I forgot that cow in rust has lifetime.
Oct 15 21:12:36 <kchibisov>	I mean CoW thingy.
Oct 15 21:12:39 <UndeadLeech>	I mean of course. It's a reference or owned.
Oct 15 21:13:02 <UndeadLeech>	If you reference something, it needs to be stored somewhere else. You need to link to that which is always a lifetime.
Oct 15 21:13:05 <kchibisov>	it's impl detail, you can do it without reference.
Oct 15 21:13:12 <UndeadLeech>	You cannot.
Oct 15 21:13:40 <kchibisov>	You can.
Oct 15 21:13:51 <UndeadLeech>	Something that isn't owned, always comes with a reference and every reference comes with a lifetime.
Oct 15 21:14:13 <kchibisov>	But the back buffer is owned, it's just shared.
Oct 15 21:14:28 <kchibisov>	it's more like Rc, but you clone buffer on access.
Oct 15 21:14:37 <kchibisov>	swift does something like that with their strings.
Oct 15 21:14:42 <kchibisov>	And a lot of other structures.
Oct 15 21:14:53 <UndeadLeech>	So you want to do reference counting?
Oct 15 21:15:16 <kchibisov>	it's CoW + Rc thing.
Oct 15 21:15:30 <UndeadLeech>	I mean the whole CoW concept doesn't work at all.
Oct 15 21:15:35 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see what you want to gain from a cow.
Oct 15 21:16:01 <kchibisov>	I was thinking of reducing allocations.
Oct 15 21:16:09 <UndeadLeech>	There are no allocations.
Oct 15 21:16:20 <UndeadLeech>	The whole point is that we avoid allocations like the plague.
Oct 15 21:16:27 <nixpulvis>	cow helps in cases like process forking, where there's a lot of read-only shared data pre-allocated.
Oct 15 21:16:58 <kchibisov>	I mean cow pages are different story.
Oct 15 21:17:19 <nixpulvis>	cow pages?
Oct 15 21:17:45 <kchibisov>	I mean that's how you do fork, no?
Oct 15 21:17:51 <kchibisov>	I mean performant fork.
Oct 15 21:17:54 <UndeadLeech>	You just end up constantly dealing with a CoW when the actual usecase of a CoW isn't even 1% of your runtime.
Oct 15 21:18:05 <UndeadLeech>	Such a massive waste of time.
Oct 15 21:18:27 <UndeadLeech>	And the benefit basically doesn't exist at all.
Oct 15 21:18:52 <nixpulvis>	I just don't know what about a cow page is differant from a cow?

Oct 16 13:09:59 <Skaface82>	hey
Oct 16 13:11:13 <kchibisov>	Hello.
Oct 16 13:11:24 <Skaface82>	I have an interesting situation.. it seems that durng a several hour long rsync, alacritty overheated and blew up my video card
Oct 16 13:11:49 <kchibisov>	what kind of video card is that?
Oct 16 13:11:59 <kchibisov>	nvidia?
Oct 16 13:12:12 <Skaface82>	a geforce 720 i think it was
Oct 16 13:12:17 <kchibisov>	We don't draw unless something is happening, and our GPU usage is very low even under a full load.
Oct 16 13:12:33 <kchibisov>	Like 2-3%.
Oct 16 13:12:37 <Skaface82>	im only assuming that is what happened
Oct 16 13:13:01 <kchibisov>	Well, you'd have better luck with software that can profile GPU usage.
Oct 16 13:13:33 <kchibisov>	If you know that alacritty uses 100% of GPU, then it's likely our fault, but you can't say that, since your display server is using your GPU as well.
Oct 16 13:14:26 <Skaface82>	oh yeah, sorry im not trying to blame anyone, I just thought it was worth mentioning in case it has happened to anyone else :)
Oct 16 13:14:35 <kchibisov>	I doubt it was.
Oct 16 13:15:05 <kchibisov>	But anyway, if OpenGL application can crash your entire system there's something wrong with the systeme already.
Oct 16 13:15:11 <kchibisov>	I
Oct 16 13:15:15 <kchibisov>	I mean in a way you say that.
Oct 16 13:18:09 <Skaface82>	it was probably just a coincidence

Oct 16 20:02:14 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Oct 16 20:02:57 <kchibisov>	But I was slow, since I was checking for matches! macro.
Oct 16 20:03:11 <UndeadLeech>	It took me a bit too, since I had to check PartialEq is implemented!
Oct 16 20:03:28 <kchibisov>	I mean you can use matches macro here.
Oct 16 20:03:34 <UndeadLeech>	But you don't want to.
Oct 16 20:03:34 <kchibisov>	I've cross checked it.
Oct 16 20:03:38 <kchibisov>	I wonder why>
Oct 16 20:03:40 <UndeadLeech>	PartialEq > matches!.
Oct 16 20:03:51 <kchibisov>	Ah.
Oct 16 20:03:53 <kchibisov>	Ok.
Oct 16 20:03:54 <UndeadLeech>	But you can use matches! in scenario where you cannot use PartialEq.
Oct 16 20:05:48 <kchibisov>	I just looked at the link to fedora packing crossfont, and it feels like they have very slow process of bringing rust...
Oct 16 20:05:52 <kchibisov>	I guess they ship it like python.
Oct 16 20:06:29 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean by very slow? They have to package every single crate then link dynamically, right?
Oct 16 20:06:43 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure that they link it dynamically.
Oct 16 20:07:07 <UndeadLeech>	I'm just wondering why they even bother, when they need to have one version of a crate.
Oct 16 20:07:12 <kchibisov>	I'm just saying that packaging all our dependencies is like ~200 packages.
Oct 16 20:07:19 <UndeadLeech>	Because when you get to Alacritty, you'll never get zero duplicates.
Oct 16 20:07:29 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: we have only one :- )
Oct 16 20:07:46 <UndeadLeech>	One what?
Oct 16 20:07:49 <kchibisov>	One duplicate.
Oct 16 20:07:54 <UndeadLeech>	What?
Oct 16 20:08:02 <kchibisov>	cargo tree -d
Oct 16 20:08:28 <UndeadLeech>	The new lockfile makes this so difficult.
Oct 16 20:08:51 <kchibisov>	I guess that's why you have 'cargo tree' now :P
Oct 16 20:08:54 <UndeadLeech>	How did the mio duplicates get resolved?
Oct 16 20:09:05 <kchibisov>	We don't use 0.7 anywhere.
Oct 16 20:09:20 <nixpulvis>	oh cargo tree is backed in now?
Oct 16 20:09:21 <UndeadLeech>	I thought someone else was though.
Oct 16 20:09:26 <nixpulvis>	baked* even
Oct 16 20:09:38 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: I'm not sure.
Oct 16 20:10:01 <kchibisov>	And it seems like the project that uses num-traits 1.x.x just not updating it.
Oct 16 20:10:06 <kchibisov>	even though it's active.
Oct 16 20:10:31 <UndeadLeech>	line_drawing you mean?
Oct 16 20:10:37 <kchibisov>	Yeah.
Oct 16 20:10:49 <kchibisov>	It's not that active, but last commit 15 Aug.
Oct 16 20:10:53 <kchibisov>	I'd assume that it's not entirely dead.
Oct 16 20:10:58 <UndeadLeech>	That should be trivial to update, let me check.
Oct 16 20:11:27 <UndeadLeech>	I kinda don't believe that we only have one duplicate though.
Oct 16 20:11:34 <kchibisov>	run cargo tree.
Oct 16 20:11:40 <UndeadLeech>	I have. I still don't.
Oct 16 20:12:02 <kchibisov>	I mean I was trying my best to bring things up to date.
Oct 16 20:12:25 <kchibisov>	Like wayland rework removed like ~20 duplicates.
Oct 16 20:12:33 <kchibisov>	maybe more.
Oct 16 20:13:12 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah but the last time I checked we had a couple of duplicate dependencies that were basically unfixable.
Oct 16 20:13:17 <UndeadLeech>	Completely unrelated to alacritty.
Oct 16 20:13:38 <UndeadLeech>	Let's see how it goes I guess: https://github.com/expenses/line_drawing/pull/17
Oct 16 20:13:41 <UndeadLeech>	Seems to be non-breaking.
Oct 16 20:14:01 <kchibisov>	You've checked that it doesn't break crate?
Oct 16 20:14:11 <UndeadLeech>	I ran `cargo test`.
Oct 16 20:14:15 <kchibisov>	fair enough.
Oct 16 20:16:20 <UndeadLeech>	Maybe someone downgraded their mio or something...
Oct 16 20:16:36 <kchibisov>	we can look at history for mio.
Oct 16 20:16:49 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean by that?
Oct 16 20:16:57 <kchibisov>	I mean in Cargo.lock.
Oct 16 20:17:29 <UndeadLeech>	If we actually manage to remove all duplicates for 0.6.0, that would really impress me.
Oct 16 20:17:45 <UndeadLeech>	I genuinely did not believe that to be possible.
Oct 16 20:18:10 <kchibisov>	We never had mio 0.7 as part of Cargo.lock.
Oct 16 20:18:18 <nixpulvis>	that'd be really nice.
Oct 16 20:18:22 <UndeadLeech>	Huh, maybe I'm mixing things up in my head.
Oct 16 20:18:29 <kchibisov>	we had 2 nix versions.
Oct 16 20:18:38 <kchibisov>	For a very long time.
Oct 16 20:19:31 <UndeadLeech>	I don't remember that being too much of an issue though.
Oct 16 20:19:43 <UndeadLeech>	Like the biggest problem with duplicates was always that one of them couldn't be upgraded for some strange reason.
Oct 16 20:21:22 <UndeadLeech>	Hmm, seems like `cargo tree` only lists for the current platform?
Oct 16 20:26:01 <kchibisov>	I guess, but I don't care about duplicates on anything other than Linux/BSD.
Oct 16 20:26:46 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, fair enough.
Oct 16 20:27:56 <UndeadLeech>	You don't expect any changes to #6 PR of crossfont for 0.6.0 either, right?
Oct 16 20:28:02 <UndeadLeech>	Because I'd actually cut a new version now I think.
Oct 16 20:28:10 <kchibisov>	I guess.
Oct 16 20:28:58 <UndeadLeech>	There have been a few changes like the BGR fix, the FreeType minimum version fix and the dependency bump. So it makes sense to release a new patch version.
Oct 16 20:29:18 <kchibisov>	I mean, I don't mind.
Oct 16 20:29:39 <UndeadLeech>	Let me just make sure Alacritty really builds against it without any errors, just to make sure. :P
Oct 16 20:43:16 <kchibisov>	I think we'll be able to do rc relatively soon.
Oct 16 20:43:34 <UndeadLeech>	My non_copy_cells PR is getting into shape. But I need to do a ton of cleanup still.
Oct 16 20:43:42 <UndeadLeech>	But I kinda want to finish it up this weekend.
Oct 16 21:11:38 <nixpulvis>	did we want to get my little macOS PR into 0.6?
Oct 16 21:11:48 <kchibisov>	if you finish it, then sure.
Oct 16 21:12:20 <nixpulvis>	I'm starting to lose faith in the upstream crate's PR ever getting merged, as expected I guess....
Oct 16 21:12:35 <nixpulvis>	but I *still* really hate the idea of writing all these damn structs.
Oct 16 21:12:39 <UndeadLeech>	Which macOS PR?
Oct 16 21:12:42 <kchibisov>	I mean just bindgen it and put in alacritty.
Oct 16 21:12:49 <kchibisov>	no need to send anything upstream.
Oct 16 21:12:51 <nixpulvis>	keeping the CWD on new instance.
Oct 16 21:12:54 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, that one.
Oct 16 21:13:13 <nixpulvis>	oh you'd'll be ok with bindgen inside alacritty?
Oct 16 21:13:20 <nixpulvis>	that would make me very happy.
Oct 16 21:13:22 <UndeadLeech>	I'd expect a RC no earlier than next weekend probably.
Oct 16 21:13:26 <UndeadLeech>	Where weekend means like thursday.
Oct 16 21:13:41 <nixpulvis>	cool
Oct 16 21:13:54 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: no, you run bindgen, you put a file inside alacritty.
Oct 16 21:14:02 <nixpulvis>	:(
Oct 16 21:14:05 <nixpulvis>	why?
Oct 16 21:14:11 <kchibisov>	And remove crap from it.
Oct 16 21:14:22 <nixpulvis>	I can tell bindgen in build.rs to filter.
Oct 16 21:14:23 <UndeadLeech>	I really don't feel like it's gonna generate so much stuff that it would be easier to run bindgen inside of Alacritty.
Oct 16 21:14:32 <UndeadLeech>	And it will never change.
Oct 16 21:14:50 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: I mean we can remove stuff from bindgen.
Oct 16 21:14:53 <UndeadLeech>	Generally I'd just like to avoid "write only" files as much as possible.
Oct 16 21:15:12 <nixpulvis>	it's a compile artifact.
Oct 16 21:15:22 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't have to be.
Oct 16 21:15:37 <nixpulvis>	I don't like committing generated files.
Oct 16 21:15:50 <UndeadLeech>	Exactly. Which is why it should be post processed and cleaned up.
Oct 16 21:16:07 <UndeadLeech>	I think the point kchibisov is making is that you can just generate the initial file with bindgen and then work based on that.
Oct 16 21:16:08 <nixpulvis>	what are the practical concerns? that our builds depend on macOS to make a macOS binary?
Oct 16 21:16:15 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: yes.
Oct 16 21:16:28 <kchibisov>	You run bindgen and remove things from it unless it compiles.
Oct 16 21:16:43 <nixpulvis>	I can generate a minimal artifact from bindgen directly tho.
Oct 16 21:16:47 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: Bindgen is complexity I'd usually like to avoid.
Oct 16 21:17:12 <UndeadLeech>	Having a module that is "normal" Rust code without any code generation makes things easier to understand.
Oct 16 21:17:23 <nixpulvis>	but now we own the structures it creates in our codebase.
Oct 16 21:17:27 <UndeadLeech>	So unless that module is like thousands of lines, I think it's easier to manually write them and make them nice.
Oct 16 21:17:42 <nixpulvis>	I'd rather depend on a well known tool like bindgen, than take on a bunch of it's structs.
Oct 16 21:17:43 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: it doesn't matter you use it anyway.
Oct 16 21:18:05 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, one way or another you use that fixed API.
Oct 16 21:18:24 <nixpulvis>	sure, but that's the interface.
Oct 16 21:18:46 <kchibisov>	I really don't want to run bindgen in build.rs
Oct 16 21:19:07 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: What's the interface?
Oct 16 21:19:08 <kchibisov>	The thing is that the result is so simple that putting it directly in alacritty makes sense.
Oct 16 21:19:16 <UndeadLeech>	You have to define the interface one way or another.
Oct 16 21:19:21 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Oct 16 21:19:39 <nixpulvis>	I still don't see what the problem is, but I guess it's not going to cause serious issues either way.
Oct 16 21:20:37 <UndeadLeech>	It's simply about "magic generate some stuff" vs "we define the API here as normal Rust code".
Oct 16 21:20:41 <kchibisov>	The problem is that you bring huge build time dependency for no reason.
Oct 16 21:20:58 <UndeadLeech>	That too. Build time code generation should be avoided as much as possible imho.
Oct 16 21:21:13 <UndeadLeech>	It's a trade-off of course.
Oct 16 21:21:14 <kchibisov>	Certain stuff implies code generation though (e.g. wayland), which is not the case here.
Oct 16 21:21:38 <nixpulvis>	"Build time code generation" lol what? that's what a compiler is!
Oct 16 21:21:41 <nixpulvis>	what about macros?
Oct 16 21:21:42 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, you gotta find a balance. I'm not defining the entire OpenGL API in our own crate as interface. That doesn't make much sense.
Oct 16 21:21:56 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: I don't like macros either.
Oct 16 21:22:05 <nixpulvis>	your crazy
Oct 16 21:22:11 <nixpulvis>	anyway...
Oct 16 21:22:18 <UndeadLeech>	Which is why if possible, I will suggest to avoid them to reduce the complexity.
Oct 16 21:22:32 <UndeadLeech>	That again, is a trade-off.
Oct 16 21:22:39 <kchibisov>	Yeah, fuck macros.
Oct 16 21:22:40 <nixpulvis>	should I move `locale.rs` into my new macos.rs module too? I feel like I could make this all grouped together easily.
Oct 16 21:22:52 <kchibisov>	They just increase build time.
Oct 16 21:22:54 <UndeadLeech>	It's a useful tool that can be very powerful and get a lot of work done in a little time. But it can also make things significantly harder to understand.
Oct 16 21:23:12 <nixpulvis>	if you care so much about build time, stop writing Rust, and just write asm.
Oct 16 21:23:20 <UndeadLeech>	I don't expect anyone to be able to understand our keyboard mapping macros, but with how many keybindings there are to define, that's the most readable option.
Oct 16 21:23:35 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: but rust without macros compiles pretty fast.
Oct 16 21:23:45 <nixpulvis>	not really.
Oct 16 21:23:53 <UndeadLeech>	Yes really.
Oct 16 21:23:54 <UndeadLeech>	Seriously.
Oct 16 21:24:21 <kchibisov>	Have you tried building rust that doesn't overly use
Oct 16 21:24:23 <nixpulvis>	I was hoping one day our default keybindsings could be described in the same way as in the config file itself, to make it easier for users to copy and modify.
Oct 16 21:24:23 <UndeadLeech>	Most of the heavy hitters when it comes to compile times are macro stuff. Especially the procedural ones like serde.
Oct 16 21:24:26 <kchibisov>	macros stuff, etc.
Oct 16 21:25:00 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: Yeah, you could change things to use a custom file format, maybe CSV-y or just our config itself. But that might increase complexity a bit.
Oct 16 21:25:04 <nixpulvis>	I guess I haven't played with compile times in a while, my memory is fuzzy.
Oct 16 21:25:48 <nixpulvis>	still my point stands, you can't beat the build speed of already built.
Oct 16 21:25:55 <UndeadLeech>	Macros are very significant when it comes to compile-times. I don't think it makes sense to avoid tiny macros to save on compilation usually, but it's certainly true that big procedural macros (especially derives) generate a TON of code.
Oct 16 21:26:03 <nixpulvis>	shit, just layout the ELF yourself,.
Oct 16 21:26:15 <UndeadLeech>	But I wouldn't argue that compile time is a big issue here, not for me at least.
Oct 16 21:26:27 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: hide your 24 cores.
Oct 16 21:26:28 <UndeadLeech>	I care much more about the complexity of things, debugging etc.
Oct 16 21:26:31 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Oct 16 21:26:48 <nixpulvis>	I care a lot about reproducability.
Oct 16 21:27:08 <nixpulvis>	so I'd probably want to at least document *how* I generated the module, no?
Oct 16 21:27:23 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't really matter, since writing it by hand is perfectly fine too.
Oct 16 21:27:30 <UndeadLeech>	Like for your usecase, it would be trivial to write by hand.
Oct 16 21:27:51 <nixpulvis>	but it's not really ideal. The code is defined by the system's headers.
Oct 16 21:28:10 <UndeadLeech>	So? That's what I'd be looking at when defining the interface.
Oct 16 21:28:24 <UndeadLeech>	If a computer program does that for you or you do it by hand doesn't really matter as long as it builds.
Oct 16 21:29:00 <nixpulvis>	OK, I can't wait to see that I got two fields out of order, and the whole thing randomly crashes.
Oct 16 21:29:26 <kchibisov>	You can even use that computer program to generate that file and edit it by hand.
Oct 16 21:29:53 *	nixpulvis smashes `dd` `p` on *accident*.
Oct 16 21:30:10 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's up to you how you want to create it. I'd honestly write it by hand because I've never done that and I'd be curious how well that works out with something so trivial, but if you use bindgen that works fine too. All that matters in the end is the output.
Oct 16 21:30:21 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: you generate with bingen, then grab that result and edit it unless it compiles, I can do it myself.
Oct 16 21:30:31 <UndeadLeech>	Since this isn't something that has to be repeated regularly and the output interface is all that matters, it doesn't really matter how you did it.
Oct 16 21:30:45 <kchibisov>	I doubt system C api will ever change.
Oct 16 21:30:45 <nixpulvis>	no need. I'm just confused why y'all hate bindgen so much.
Oct 16 21:31:06 <kchibisov>	bindgen has one specific reason, to build firefox.
Oct 16 21:31:14 <nixpulvis>	>.<
Oct 16 21:31:15 <kchibisov>	Since they generate bridges on the fly.
Oct 16 21:31:33 <kchibisov>	Because of complexity of firefox.
Oct 16 21:31:49 <nixpulvis>	It saves a lot of people a lot of time.
Oct 16 21:31:52 <kchibisov>	Like you can't manually do that for their multi million source code base.
Oct 16 21:32:00 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: yes, but not for 100 LoC file.
Oct 16 21:32:10 <nixpulvis>	let's agree to disagree.
Oct 16 21:32:20 <kchibisov>	I'd rather see what you've added in that file, rather than check how you've setup bindgen.
Oct 16 21:32:49 <nixpulvis>	inspect the artifact in target :P
Oct 16 21:33:08 <kchibisov>	I should grab them from our CI though.
Oct 16 21:33:40 <nixpulvis>	yea, that's part of my issue here... this forces me to spend more time programming on my damn mac
Oct 16 21:33:41 <kchibisov>	I can't inspect them, I'm on Linux, I don't have libproc.
Oct 16 21:33:58 <nixpulvis>	I guess I'll just boot up it's sshd... but I'm still not happy about it.
Oct 16 21:34:42 <kchibisov>	I mean if you don't want I can do that.
Oct 16 21:34:54 <nixpulvis>	no worries
Oct 16 21:35:06 <kchibisov>	Like we all happen to have macOS>
Oct 16 21:35:29 <kchibisov>	And it's not like you can blindly impl that on Linux, you still have to at least run it and see how it goes.
Oct 16 21:36:05 <nixpulvis>	there's a few bugs on macOS, but generally things work OK.
Oct 16 21:36:18 <UndeadLeech>	I don't mind bindgen. It's a tool, it has its usecases. But I don't think this is one of them.
Oct 16 21:36:43 <nixpulvis>	still way better than windows, despite windows trying a little bit these days.
Oct 16 21:37:33 <UndeadLeech>	Also with how simple this should be, I think it makes far more sense to implement it first and then discuss it. I don't know how the result will look like either, I'm just guessing at that point. Once it's done, it's gonna be much more concrete.
Oct 16 21:38:06 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: I've seen the C header, was like 100 LoC.
Oct 16 21:38:20 <nixpulvis>	I mean, it's done already using bindgen :P but also a crate, which I completely agree at this point is worth avoiding.
Oct 16 21:38:50 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, that's what my estimation is based on. But it's still only an estimation. There's a reason for why I made this suggestion, but that of course doesn't mean that my surface level guess is 100% accurate.
Oct 16 21:39:51 <UndeadLeech>	I said from the beginning that my primary concern is to avoid the crate. Using bindgen or not both are reasonable, I just think without it is going to give us better results.
Oct 16 21:40:27 <UndeadLeech>	Also since you asked about locale.rs, I'd be fine with moving it to macos/locale.rs or whatever, but I don't think it would be smart to just make a generic "macos.rs". I feel like that would easily get out of hand.
Oct 16 21:41:13 <nixpulvis>	agreed
Oct 16 21:41:13 <kchibisov>	I'd like platform/macOS/locale.rs
Oct 16 21:41:19 <nixpulvis>	can do
Oct 16 21:41:28 <kchibisov>	And I'd move wayland_theme there as well.
Oct 16 21:41:39 <nixpulvis>	oh yea, that was bothing me too.
Oct 16 21:41:46 <nixpulvis>	bothering even*
Oct 16 21:41:47 <kchibisov>	I mean into platform/nix/wayland.rs
Oct 16 21:42:05 <kchibisov>	But I'm not sure tbqh.
Oct 16 21:42:15 <nixpulvis>	So we all have macs? does that mean we can test #4133. I haven't touched this thing enough to really know how to control the GPUs.
Oct 16 21:42:16 <kchibisov>	We may be fine with just macOS/locale.rs
Oct 16 21:42:31 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: we have macs, but it doesn't mean that we use macs.
Oct 16 21:42:41 <nixpulvis>	I can give it a look today
Oct 16 21:43:15 <nixpulvis>	the platform/ file is a winit convention, but we already just have tty/windows/ for example...
Oct 16 21:43:18 <kchibisov>	I can't test 4133.
Oct 16 21:43:23 <kchibisov>	I don't have dGPU.
Oct 16 21:44:09 <kchibisov>	for UndeadLeech it's using dGPU with None.
Oct 16 21:44:17 <kchibisov>	I mean Some(None)
Oct 16 21:44:39 <kchibisov>	(or whatever it was when forcing integrated GPU)
Oct 16 21:44:59 <nixpulvis>	So System Preferences has the checkbox for "Automatic graphics switching" but the "About This Mac" window tells me I have Intel Iris Pro...
Oct 16 21:45:38 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: do you have dGPU, right?
Oct 16 21:45:40 <nixpulvis>	ok good, that's just the active one? how strange.
Oct 16 21:46:00 <nixpulvis>	it does in fact appear to have a 750M
Oct 16 21:46:31 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: how are you testing it?
Oct 16 21:46:41 <kchibisov>	I doubt any mac had dGPU with 750M.
Oct 16 21:47:39 <kchibisov>	it's really more like if it's 13.3 inch -> iGPU, 15+ -> dGPU.
Oct 16 21:47:45 <nixpulvis>	are you saying my sytem report is lying to me?
Oct 16 21:48:00 <kchibisov>	I mean if it's some ancient mac, maybe.
Oct 16 21:48:15 <nixpulvis>	"Late 2013"
Oct 16 21:48:26 <kchibisov>	Maybe it has 1GB or something.
Oct 16 21:48:36 <kchibisov>	But yeah, that could be true.
Oct 16 21:48:39 <nixpulvis>	2GB
Oct 16 21:54:35 <UndeadLeech>	#4133 is for Linux, not macOS.
Oct 16 21:54:51 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't work on macOS>
Oct 16 21:55:28 <kchibisov>	yeah, and the only one who can test it on macOS is someone with bumble bee.
Oct 16 21:55:42 <nixpulvis>	oh god
Oct 16 21:55:49 <nixpulvis>	I could put arch on this damn thing.
Oct 16 21:55:56 <kchibisov>	err, s/macOS/Linux/
Oct 16 21:56:11 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: don't you have thinkpad with nvidia?
Oct 16 21:56:20 <nixpulvis>	nope
Oct 16 21:56:39 <kchibisov>	I though that you had x1 carbon or something like that.
Oct 16 21:56:43 <kchibisov>	thoght*
Oct 16 21:56:55 <nixpulvis>	#4133 saying it's for macOS in the description unless I'm losing my mind.
Oct 16 21:57:06 <nixpulvis>	I do have an x1 carbon.
Oct 16 21:57:07 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: I've told on that PR that it's for Linux.
Oct 16 21:57:10 <UndeadLeech>	Because I confused myself.
Oct 16 21:57:12 <UndeadLeech>	I was wrong.
Oct 16 21:57:15 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: well, it should have nvidia, right?
Oct 16 21:57:20 <kchibisov>	or it's intel only somehow?
Oct 16 21:57:29 <nixpulvis>	oh... I guess I can't trust the description.
Oct 16 21:57:41 <nixpulvis>	it's a tiny little laptop.
Oct 16 21:57:49 <nixpulvis>	very thin
Oct 16 21:57:53 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: it doesn't matter they should have dGPU.
Oct 16 21:58:12 <nixpulvis>	I swear I've checked this in the past, but remind me.
Oct 16 21:58:33 <kchibisov>	Oh, they don't have it...
Oct 16 21:58:42 <nixpulvis>	lspci | grep VGA lists a single Intel device.
Oct 16 21:58:57 <kchibisov>	I swear some of them has dGPU.
Oct 16 21:59:19 <nixpulvis>	strange, vtebench runs in a fraction of the window on macos.
Oct 16 21:59:30 <kchibisov>	new one?
Oct 16 21:59:32 <UndeadLeech>	Hm?
Oct 16 21:59:54 <nixpulvis>	like, it's not printing to the whole thing.
Oct 16 22:00:45 <kchibisov>	Ah, it's x1 extreme with dGPUs.
Oct 16 22:00:52 <nixpulvis>	dense grid for example uses only about 1/3 of the top. and the others seem to avoid the right 1/3 of the columns. Unicode takes up the full thing tho.
Oct 16 22:03:04 <kchibisov>	Could you do 'tput cols'
Oct 16 22:03:15 <kchibisov>	and 'tput lines'
Oct 16 22:06:36 <nixpulvis>	yea damn, my mac with energy: Powersave still seems to be using the dGPU.
Oct 16 22:07:33 <nixpulvis>	tput cols tells me 122 which is correct.
Oct 16 22:08:05 <UndeadLeech>	Fyi iTerm also doesn't switch between iGPU/dGPU.
Oct 16 22:08:09 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure it's possible.
Oct 16 22:08:20 <nixpulvis>	>.<
Oct 16 22:08:26 <nixpulvis>	useless fucking computers.
Oct 16 22:08:39 <UndeadLeech>	You can edit the Info.plist, but that's hardly graphics switching.
Oct 16 22:08:45 <UndeadLeech>	But on Linux this should work, if I could test it.
Oct 16 22:10:39 <kchibisov>	I wonder if that GPU stuff should be in env variable.
Oct 16 22:10:47 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Oct 16 22:10:54 <kchibisov>	I mean, not in config.
Oct 16 22:10:59 <UndeadLeech>	No.
Oct 16 22:11:13 <kchibisov>	Like I don't feel like adding an option, that doen't really work into config.
Oct 16 22:11:15 <UndeadLeech>	Nothing should be in the env.
Oct 16 22:11:27 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it should work on Linux.
Oct 16 22:11:34 <kchibisov>	'should'.
Oct 16 22:11:46 <UndeadLeech>	I mean if it ever gets merged, it is because it does work on Linux.
Oct 16 22:11:58 <UndeadLeech>	So that's a relatively safe assumption.
Oct 16 22:33:16 <Skaface82>	kchibisov: I come back in shame, I suggested the possibility of my video card dieing while scrolling heaps of text for hours in alacrity, turns out after swapping video cards and messing around I realised that my cat pressed the input switch button on my monitor :D
Oct 16 22:33:40 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Oct 16 22:33:57 <kchibisov>	(╭ರ_•́)
Oct 16 23:44:13 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: you've check that crossfont#13 works with alacritty, right?
Oct 16 23:44:35 <kchibisov>	I know that it does, just asking, since you've explicitly mentioned that at some point.
Oct 16 23:46:51 <UndeadLeech>	Yep.
Oct 16 23:47:33 <UndeadLeech>	Oh wow, the scrolling_top benchmarks yesterday had a massive performance change.
Oct 16 23:47:38 <UndeadLeech>	Probably due to 1.47.0 update.
Oct 16 23:50:25 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, kchibisov did you publish it?
Oct 16 23:51:11 <kchibisov>	Yeah, I've done everything.
Oct 16 23:51:24 <UndeadLeech>	Pfft, taking all the credit for yourself, huh? :D
Oct 16 23:51:56 <kchibisov>	I mean if you've pushed a tag faster than me somehow :P

Oct 17 01:07:42 *	Topic for #alacritty set by UndeadLeech!~UndeadLee@165.227.76.134 (Sat Aug  1 00:45:32 2020)
Oct 17 01:35:12 <nixpulvis>	what happened in 1.47.0?
Oct 17 01:35:26 <UndeadLeech>	Dunno.
Oct 17 01:35:28 <UndeadLeech>	Changes probably.
Oct 17 01:35:40 <nixpulvis>	classic, fucking changes.
Oct 17 01:37:03 <nixpulvis>	what crate is 1.47 on anyway?
Oct 17 01:38:02 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Oct 17 01:38:08 <UndeadLeech>	I'm talking about Rust.
Oct 17 01:38:16 <nixpulvis>	lolol oh
Oct 17 01:38:27 <UndeadLeech>	They updated LLVM, so it might be related to that. Some optimizations maybe.
Oct 17 01:39:37 <nixpulvis>	i guess I've been using 1.48 anyway...
Oct 17 01:40:37 <UndeadLeech>	Beta you mean?
Oct 17 01:41:13 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: it's just strange how fast it is.
Oct 17 01:41:38 <UndeadLeech>	I find it strange that my branch's performance has degraded since yesterday.
Oct 17 01:41:46 <UndeadLeech>	As long as it's faster, that's fine by me.
Oct 17 01:41:57 <kchibisov>	roted a bit.
Oct 17 01:42:16 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: it could mean that llvm was guessing something oddly.
Oct 17 01:42:34 <UndeadLeech>	Previously you mean? Yeah.
Oct 17 01:42:42 <UndeadLeech>	Though it's still worse than bottom, which makes sense.
Oct 17 01:43:27 <UndeadLeech>	I think the last remaining issue with the non_copy_cell stuff is the performance of Row::new. Since that involves a lot of stuff.
Oct 17 01:43:35 <kchibisov>	but it's ~2x improvement.
Oct 17 01:43:37 <UndeadLeech>	And unfortunately our benchmarks are a bit short.
Oct 17 01:44:16 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not too concerned with the top benchmarks at all tbh.
Oct 17 01:44:45 <kchibisov>	I am concerned, since looking at 2x speedups on amd64 is strange.
Oct 17 01:44:49 <kchibisov>	from a compiler bump.
Oct 17 01:44:59 <UndeadLeech>	Is it though?
Oct 17 01:45:09 <kchibisov>	Yeah.
Oct 17 01:45:21 <UndeadLeech>	I've had 2x performance differences just by switching around two statements in my non_copy_cells stuff.
Oct 17 01:45:25 <UndeadLeech>	It wouldn't surprise me.
Oct 17 01:45:38 <kchibisov>	I mean from optimizations.
Oct 17 01:45:52 <UndeadLeech>	Knowing what you're allowed to switch around is an optimization.
Oct 17 01:45:59 <kchibisov>	Like whatever you switch around doesn't matter, since you're writing that code.
Oct 17 01:46:14 <UndeadLeech>	I have to switch that stuff around to influence code generation though.
Oct 17 01:46:18 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: well, that's true, but you can't really switch around sometimes.
Oct 17 01:46:32 <kchibisov>	But I guess.
Oct 17 01:46:47 <kchibisov>	I forgot that you can switch around though.
Oct 17 01:46:50 <UndeadLeech>	Stuff like auto vectorization can also make a massive difference.
Oct 17 01:46:57 <kchibisov>	I was writing for arch where you can't do that.
Oct 17 01:47:25 <kchibisov>	I mean writing optimizations in llvm.
Oct 17 01:48:01 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you're much more familiar with LLVM than I am. But this is just hottish code where small changes can easily make big differences. Especially since this part of the code isn't optimized well.
Oct 17 01:48:21 <kchibisov>	Like you know, I'm expecting that amd64 is very polished just by looking at the amount of things it has for amd64.
Oct 17 01:48:26 <UndeadLeech>	But of course I haven't verified at all that this result is consistent, I might have just been doing something strange yesterday at 2am.
Oct 17 01:48:41 <UndeadLeech>	I'm currently constantly running benchmarks for non_copy_cells.
Oct 17 01:49:04 <kchibisov>	Though, maybe llvm changed something on higher level with ir passes.
Oct 17 01:49:15 <UndeadLeech>	Could have also been a Rust change.
Oct 17 01:49:25 <kchibisov>	Or a change from both sides.
Oct 17 01:49:34 <UndeadLeech>	Could also be completely unrelated to all of that and just be random fluctuation.
Oct 17 01:49:45 <UndeadLeech>	I just know that I updated 1.47.0, so that's the most likely cause I'd say.
Oct 17 01:49:52 <kchibisov>	Like llvm is a bit C-ish.
Oct 17 01:50:19 <UndeadLeech>	Isn't that kinda the point of C++? :P
Oct 17 01:50:30 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: I mean in terms of IR and passes.
Oct 17 01:51:06 <kchibisov>	Like I'm not talking about API of llvm.
Oct 17 01:51:37 <UndeadLeech>	God damn it, I don't remember what made this work yesterday.
Oct 17 01:51:53 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: try previos rust?
Oct 17 01:52:03 <kchibisov>	Maybe that what broke things for you.
Oct 17 01:52:11 <UndeadLeech>	Tried it already.
Oct 17 01:52:20 <UndeadLeech>	Though I could try again, I made some changes.
Oct 17 01:52:27 <UndeadLeech>	Just always so many factors.
Oct 17 01:52:35 <UndeadLeech>	I think I ran with 1.47.0 yesterday too though.
Oct 17 01:53:05 <kchibisov>	Though, rust overcomes llvm limitations with their mir.
Oct 17 01:53:21 <kchibisov>	limitations -> missing optimizations.
Oct 17 01:54:03 <kchibisov>	But a lot of modern kinda safe languages on top of llvm having their own internal language.
Oct 17 02:10:39 <nixpulvis>	rust has the ability to do some additional transforms that LLVM can't because the types are weaker.
Oct 17 02:11:15 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: the point are not types most of the time.
Oct 17 02:11:17 <UndeadLeech>	Weak<ER>
Oct 17 02:11:28 <kchibisov>	the point is thta you can't do constant propagation properly in llvm.
Oct 17 02:11:51 <kchibisov>	I mean you can, but not for all things that you may be interested in.
Oct 17 02:13:17 <kchibisov>	And in fact rust added it in mir in like 2019.
Oct 17 02:13:53 <kchibisov>	(I still don't get why rust called their ir as mir, since llvm also has mir)
Oct 17 02:19:32 <UndeadLeech>	Because it's between the HIR and the LLVM IR?
Oct 17 02:20:53 <kchibisov>	yeah, and then you have mir after LLVM IR...
Oct 17 02:21:14 <kchibisov>	it's like HIR -> MIR -> LLVM IR -> MIR(from llvm) ->
Oct 17 02:21:54 <kchibisov>	And no, llvm's thing is machiine ir, and rust's one is mid-level ir.
Oct 17 02:21:58 <kchibisov>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 17 02:24:26 <nixpulvis>	should have called it Myrrh
Oct 17 02:25:59 <kchibisov>	I'd call HIR as OIR and MIR as AOIR.
Oct 17 02:26:33 <nixpulvis>	O? A?
Oct 17 02:27:09 <kchibisov>	Well, A is for another.
Oct 17 02:27:14 <nixpulvis>	figured
Oct 17 02:27:17 <kchibisov>	And O could be literally anything.
Oct 17 02:27:32 <nixpulvis>	well damn that's useless
Oct 17 02:27:44 <kchibisov>	Could be our, could be other.
Oct 17 02:28:01 <nixpulvis>	another other ....
Oct 17 02:28:02 <kchibisov>	clearly shows that you've reached a point that you have too many irs to care about.
Oct 17 02:28:43 <kchibisov>	I'd use our though.
Oct 17 02:28:50 <nixpulvis>	yes, everything should be some ideal dependent LLVM MIR
Oct 17 02:29:41 <nixpulvis>	funny you mention const prop tho. Since I'm trying to think about information flow atm.
Oct 17 02:29:59 <kchibisov>	data flow?
Oct 17 02:30:05 <nixpulvis>	sure
Oct 17 02:31:40 <kchibisov>	The thing is that the amount of layers of different passes on different intermidiate represenations is getting bigger an bigger.
Oct 17 02:32:22 <nixpulvis>	why?
Oct 17 02:32:32 <kchibisov>	The good thing that all transformations are deterministic and once you've got a math it works.
Oct 17 02:32:45 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: I mean they try to run code faster?
Oct 17 02:33:04 <kchibisov>	And most of the time some IR is lacking something.
Oct 17 02:33:20 <nixpulvis>	just make my curcuits small.
Oct 17 02:33:21 <kchibisov>	or some phase of transforming IR is lacking something.
Oct 17 02:35:46 <nixpulvis>	but yea, sometimes it takes a custom data structure to do some algorithm properly.
Oct 17 02:36:39 <nixpulvis>	stupid question: can LLVM reason about 1 + 1 = 2?
Oct 17 02:37:00 <kchibisov>	that's called constant evoluation.
Oct 17 02:37:04 <nixpulvis>	i know
Oct 17 02:37:07 <kchibisov>	it can do that for sure.
Oct 17 02:37:10 <nixpulvis>	so I assume yes
Oct 17 02:37:12 <nixpulvis>	good
Oct 17 02:37:22 <nixpulvis>	where does that stop working?
Oct 17 02:37:24 <kchibisov>	The point with constant propagation is a bit different.
Oct 17 02:37:34 <kchibisov>	CE != CP
Oct 17 02:37:55 <kchibisov>	CE is easier to do than CP.
Oct 17 02:37:59 <nixpulvis>	they're related tho.
Oct 17 02:38:03 <nixpulvis>	oh?
Oct 17 02:38:19 <kchibisov>	Yes, they are.
Oct 17 02:38:31 <kchibisov>	But the point is that you don't need CE in rust.
Oct 17 02:38:35 <kchibisov>	But you could need CP in rust.
Oct 17 02:38:45 <UndeadLeech>	Do you guys think it's even worth it to bother optimizing the grid initialization to the last %?
Oct 17 02:39:12 <UndeadLeech>	I'm wondering if we should change our benchmarks to fill the grid before every run. Like write 100k lines outside of the benchmark.
Oct 17 02:39:14 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: depends, but grid initialization should be relatively fast?
Oct 17 02:39:23 <kchibisov>	I mean that you don't initialize it a lot.
Oct 17 02:39:29 <kchibisov>	s/fast/rare/
Oct 17 02:39:35 <UndeadLeech>	I mean define "relatively fast".
Oct 17 02:40:21 <UndeadLeech>	This is what I'm currently working with: https://paste.rs/CTf.png
Oct 17 02:40:23 <nixpulvis>	I'd at least make one new benchmark tracking that spesifically...
Oct 17 02:40:34 <UndeadLeech>	On my 6700k the gap is significantly bigger than my computer.
Oct 17 02:40:35 <nixpulvis>	I do open new terminals quite frequently.
Oct 17 02:40:45 <kchibisov>	I really don't care about scrolling that much.
Oct 17 02:40:55 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: Yeah, but we're talking like a few milliseconds.
Oct 17 02:40:58 <kchibisov>	Like if it's due to init that's likely fine.
Oct 17 02:41:24 <nixpulvis>	I doubt it's a big problem... but what's the issue if you don't care enough to track it?
Oct 17 02:42:09 <kchibisov>	The point is that scrolling sucking a bit due to grid initialization isn't a bit of a deal, since 'yes' is pretty artificial benchmark.
Oct 17 02:42:43 <nixpulvis>	kchibisov: wikipedia's example of CP uses CE directly in making it's case... I'm not sure how far you get with CP alone.
Oct 17 02:43:22 <UndeadLeech>	I mean even in a 'yes' benchmark scenario, you're not going to notice a difference of 10ms.
Oct 17 02:43:48 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: you need to test with more payload.
Oct 17 02:43:54 <nixpulvis>	how would you implement this? just warm up with a bunch of text pushed? How will other terminals act?
Oct 17 02:44:09 <kchibisov>	s/more/bigger/
Oct 17 02:44:21 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: I know, that's why I have suggested to change the payload size of vtebench.
Oct 17 02:44:32 <kchibisov>	You mean default?
Oct 17 02:44:38 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Oct 17 02:44:44 <kchibisov>	I guess you can bump it.
Oct 17 02:44:48 <UndeadLeech>	Or alternatively initializing scrollback.
Oct 17 02:45:15 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: the thing is that you can propage constants in rust and then lower llvm's CE will do the thing.
Oct 17 02:45:18 <UndeadLeech>	I'm just not entirely sure if your benchmarks aren't too tiny at the moment.
Oct 17 02:45:23 <kchibisov>	propagate*
Oct 17 02:45:32 <kchibisov>	I'm not saying that you can do only CP.
Oct 17 02:45:41 <kchibisov>	I'm saying that CP is harder to do in llvm ir in some cases.
Oct 17 02:45:48 <kchibisov>	But whoever will do CE doesn't matter.
Oct 17 02:46:05 <kchibisov>	And llvm will do its own CP as well.
Oct 17 02:46:20 <nixpulvis>	I see. Yea CP needs to deal with reaching variable stuff
Oct 17 02:46:41 <UndeadLeech>	Ooooh, constant propagation.
Oct 17 02:47:33 <kchibisov>	though, knowing that rust can do CE, I guess it can run it as well.
Oct 17 02:47:45 <kchibisov>	And do a multipass CP -> CE..
Oct 17 02:48:01 <nixpulvis>	CP is something rust's type system seems very well suited for.
Oct 17 02:48:04 <kchibisov>	I mean it can do CE on language level, I bet they have infra already.
Oct 17 02:48:18 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: yeah, I guess that's why you have it there.
Oct 17 02:48:31 <kchibisov>	since llvm's one lacks const info in some cases.
Oct 17 02:48:47 <kchibisov>	And it can't speculate with how pointers are working in rust.
Oct 17 02:49:07 <nixpulvis>	it can speculate ;)
Oct 17 02:49:22 <nixpulvis>	nothing good ever comes from speculative execution tho.
Oct 17 02:49:29 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Oct 17 02:49:40 <UndeadLeech>	I bet AMD disagrees with you.
Oct 17 02:49:43 <kchibisov>	nixpulvis: I mean speculate in terms of make some assumptions about pointer usage.
Oct 17 02:50:16 <kchibisov>	And how it could be used accross module boundaries.
Oct 17 02:52:35 <kchibisov>	That's a good example of C-ish in llvm https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878
Oct 17 02:52:52 <kchibisov>	Since I bet you don't have that many noalias things in C.

Oct 17 17:44:11 <nixpulvis>	oh look at that, I got a response in heim-rs/darwin-libproc. I don't really think this changes anything tho.
Oct 17 17:44:35 <kchibisov>	it doesn't, we're not adding one more crate for one file.
Oct 17 17:45:19 <nixpulvis>	I find it kinda funny that the maintainer doesn't have macOS on hand either.
Oct 17 17:47:28 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Oct 17 17:53:41 *	kchibisov just found out that he forgot to close some old issue that is kind of obsolete.
Oct 17 19:59:27 <prion>	when i run alacritty with -o i get this error
Oct 17 19:59:47 <prion>	Found argument '-o' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context
Oct 17 20:00:03 <kchibisov>	Could you give the entire command line?
Oct 17 20:00:38 <prion>	alacritty -o font.size=10
Oct 17 20:00:55 <kchibisov>	What's the output of alacritty --version?
Oct 17 20:01:02 <prion>	0.5.0
Oct 17 20:01:13 <kchibisov>	-o isn't supported on 0.5.0
Oct 17 20:01:33 <prion>	then why does 0.5.0 come with a man page that documents -o
Oct 17 20:01:33 <kchibisov>	you should build master branch.
Oct 17 20:02:13 <UndeadLeech>	prion: 0.5.0 doesn't come with a man page that documents -o.
Oct 17 20:02:24 <kchibisov>	prion: there's no -o in a man page https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/v0.5.0/extra/alacritty.man
Oct 17 20:02:26 <kchibisov>	for 0.5.0
Oct 17 20:02:45 <kchibisov>	if someone provided you a manpage with -o it's not our fault.
Oct 17 20:02:53 <prion>	ok then i'm confused... how did i end up in this state
Oct 17 20:03:08 <prion>	i cloned the repo and built from source
Oct 17 20:03:09 <kchibisov>	idk, maybe you have a man page from master branch somewhere.
Oct 17 20:03:15 <kchibisov>	Ok.
Oct 17 20:03:18 <prion>	on Oct 8
Oct 17 20:03:25 <kchibisov>	yes, it's master branch.
Oct 17 20:03:29 <kchibisov>	And it has -o.
Oct 17 20:03:48 <kchibisov>	where did you install the alacritty?
Oct 17 20:03:58 <kchibisov>	And check that 'which' resolved to it.
Oct 17 20:05:06 <prion>	it's in ~/.cargo/bin/alacritty... but now that i think of it, maybe i did "cargo install alacritty" before i built from source
Oct 17 20:05:25 <prion>	ok i also have /usr/local/bin/alacritty which is 0.6.0-dev
Oct 17 20:05:37 <kchibisov>	And .cargo/bin/alacritty is likely 0.5.0.
Oct 17 20:06:38 <prion>	yep
Oct 17 20:07:00 <nixpulvis>	also depends where you were loading the man page from...
Oct 17 20:07:38 <prion>	cargo uninstall alacritty fixed everything
Oct 17 20:07:42 <prion>	sorry for the confusion

Oct 18 21:20:11 <kchibisov>	How ppl can even defend terminal that prints 90KB of text in 1.1 seconds....
Oct 18 21:20:13 <kchibisov>	Like how.
Oct 18 21:29:44 <UndeadLeech>	Which one is that?
Oct 18 21:30:01 <kchibisov>	https://github.com/91861/wayst
Oct 18 21:30:33 <kchibisov>	I mean, if you put 'st' in a terminal name you already marked your software as shit.
Oct 18 21:30:50 <kchibisov>	In a way that it refers to 'st'.
Oct 18 21:30:53 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's literally called waste, sooo...
Oct 18 21:31:04 <kchibisov>	good one.
Oct 18 21:31:19 <UndeadLeech>	But that seems extremely slow.
Oct 18 21:31:35 <kchibisov>	I mean it reaches 5fps on first benchmark on vtebench
Oct 18 21:31:56 <kchibisov>	And I'm not sure that it was able to finish 2nd dense cells.
Oct 18 21:32:22 <kchibisov>	And I crashed it like twice in a raw from completely different things.
Oct 18 21:32:56 <kchibisov>	I mean, I don't think that I can expect much from 3 month old C software.
Oct 18 21:33:33 <kchibisov>	But before you add all your features, I think it makes sense to make your shit a bit stable in first.
Oct 18 21:37:49 <kchibisov>	I've noticed that 1s for 90KB, because it was priniting dmesg in 300ms, which was 30KB.
Oct 18 21:38:08 <kchibisov>	And it was the first time I was waiting for dmesg to print.
Oct 18 21:50:40 <UndeadLeech>	That sounds pretty bad, yeah. And generally you should have a good foundation in place before building up on it. Usually terminals don't get faster over time after more features are added.
Oct 18 21:50:50 <UndeadLeech>	At that point why even bother with C?
Oct 18 21:54:27 <kchibisov>	To use  -ffast-math in CFLAGS.
Oct 18 21:54:46 <leibniz[m]>	http://i.imgur.com/bq22ZOf.png
Oct 18 21:54:47 <leibniz[m]>	Just a temporary question, why emojis are messed up again? I've added the fall back noto emoji color to my configs and it worked with non nerd font variants.
Oct 18 21:54:47 <leibniz[m]>	(I'm gonna revert to the non-nerd for other reasons)
Oct 18 21:54:49 <kchibisov>	They force it by default in clags.
Oct 18 21:55:02 <kchibisov>	leibniz[m]: it's some other font showing them.
Oct 18 21:55:16 <kchibisov>	alacritty can only render them, but it doesn't prefer any particular font for them.
Oct 18 21:57:35 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: Can I detect which font? It must be that nerd font has this black and white emojis because otherwise alacritty was using noto emoji color
Oct 18 22:02:44 <kchibisov>	leibniz[m]: you may try fc-match -s 'YOUR_FONT'.
Oct 18 22:02:57 <kchibisov>	Will show the order of fonts we're picking.
Oct 18 22:06:05 <kchibisov>	Something like 'DejaVu Sans Mono' has those monochrome things most of the time.
Oct 18 22:07:25 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: yeah it's weird. when I fc-match -s Inconsolata, the noto color comes second.But for the nerd font variant it doesn't even come anywher
Oct 18 22:07:44 <kchibisov>	Are you using Inconsolate in config?
Oct 18 22:07:55 <kchibisov>	or InconsolateLGC Nerd Font?
Oct 18 22:08:03 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: InconsolateLGC Nerd Font
Oct 18 22:08:26 <kchibisov>	So you do'fc-match -s "InconsolateLGC Nerd Font"
Oct 18 22:09:25 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: got a match for "Inconsolata LGC Nerd Font Mono"...confusing names.
Oct 18 22:09:31 <leibniz[m]>	why noto color is last?
Oct 18 22:09:38 <kchibisov>	leibniz[m]: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 18 22:09:45 <leibniz[m]>	for regular inconsolara notocolor is second
Oct 18 22:09:48 <kchibisov>	Do you have a fontconfig rules for Inconsolate?
Oct 18 22:11:08 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: no . but for monospace:     <alias> <family>monospace</family><prefer><family>DejaVu Sans Mono</family><family>Noto Color Emoji</family></prefer></alias>
Oct 18 22:11:44 <kchibisov>	it's your own config? Not the system one?
Oct 18 22:12:37 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: /.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf..its mine.
Oct 18 22:12:56 <leibniz[m]>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/153#issuecomment-630636358
Oct 18 22:13:06 <leibniz[m]>	added due to this issue
Oct 18 22:13:26 <kchibisov>	Ok. you can try replacing DejaVu Sans Mono in that file with Inconsolata LGC Nerd Font Mono.
Oct 18 22:13:55 <kchibisov>	And then 'fc-cache -srvf' and use 'monospace' in alacritty.yml.
Oct 18 22:14:09 <kchibisov>	You can try doing fc-match -s "monospace" afterwards.
Oct 18 22:17:15 <leibniz[m]>	kchibisov: thanks. :)

Nov 06 21:52:04 <UndeadLeech>	lol
Nov 06 21:52:23 <UndeadLeech>	We had it on macOS too, right?
Nov 06 21:52:40 <UndeadLeech>	Which literally just stopped accepting data after a certain point.
Nov 06 22:46:49 <kchibisov>	Hm, I wonder whether it's worth it to run rustfmt first.
Nov 06 23:51:13 <UndeadLeech>	I intentionally structured it this way so less external resources are used. Like rustfmt is fairly quick, but requires installing a new tool.
Nov 07 01:12:10 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Can you still repro https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3959?
Nov 07 01:12:51 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, nvm. That's a different issue.
Nov 07 01:14:20 <UndeadLeech>	I'd be curious how you feel about this issue though.
Nov 07 01:14:33 <UndeadLeech>	I don't feel like it should be solved the way it's suggested.
Nov 07 01:14:39 <kchibisov>	I'll look once I fix Wayland stuff.
Nov 07 01:14:45 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, take your time.
Nov 07 01:15:02 <UndeadLeech>	The cursor issue is fixed with the new renderer, right?
Nov 07 01:15:45 <UndeadLeech>	Like the cursor being drawn behind underline and stuff.
Nov 07 01:15:55 <kchibisov>	I think, anyway I think it's kind of pointless to fix anything with our current renderer, knowing that new-renderer-pr is likely what we'll have.
Nov 07 01:16:21 <kchibisov>	I'm not sure whether it's fixed, I'd also like to check new-renderer-pr orderings.
Nov 07 01:16:34 <kchibisov>	Since from what I remember it's not really above.
Nov 07 01:16:50 <kchibisov>	And there was a reason why it can't be made above, but I don't remember.
Nov 07 01:17:00 <UndeadLeech>	Oh interesting, I'll at least leave a note on the issue then.
Nov 07 01:17:12 <kchibisov>	Ah, it's due to block cursor.
Nov 07 01:17:25 <kchibisov>	since block cursor is a glyph and character should be above it.
Nov 07 01:17:36 <kchibisov>	The same for hollow block.
Nov 07 01:17:42 <UndeadLeech>	You mean box? Because block cursor shouldn't be a glyph?
Nov 07 01:17:52 <kchibisov>	Box.
Nov 07 01:18:02 <kchibisov>	Anyway, I think we can tune new-renderer after we want to.
Nov 07 01:18:04 <UndeadLeech>	There's no problem with box cursor to be in front.
Nov 07 01:18:16 <kchibisov>	I also thought that way.
Nov 07 01:18:28 <kchibisov>	But I was trying not to push with fixing such thing there.
Nov 07 01:18:41 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, no worries. Can always be done later.
Nov 07 01:18:42 <kchibisov>	Since the goal was to have something working and something we can work with.
Nov 07 01:19:08 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, I'm perfectly fine with having just a MVP merged, as long as that's solid.
Nov 07 01:19:28 <kchibisov>	yeah, it fixes perf issues with unicode I was having.
Nov 07 01:19:40 <kchibisov>	And should also fixed cropped wide chars.
Nov 07 01:19:57 <UndeadLeech>	Nice. We gotta go and hunt down all the issues then.
Nov 07 01:20:02 <UndeadLeech>	Aliasing is also fixed, right?
Nov 07 01:20:10 <kchibisov>	What aliasing?
Nov 07 01:20:14 <kchibisov>	overlapping?
Nov 07 01:20:18 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Nov 07 01:20:26 <kchibisov>	it's not.
Nov 07 01:20:33 <UndeadLeech>	That's a bummer.
Nov 07 01:20:40 <kchibisov>	It can be fixed though.
Nov 07 01:20:58 <UndeadLeech>	That's one of the very, very few things I really want to see fixed in Alacritty.
Nov 07 01:21:14 <UndeadLeech>	Like the last major thing that annoys me personally.
Nov 07 01:21:18 <kchibisov>	I guess, it looks better with overlapping though.
Nov 07 01:21:28 <kchibisov>	At some point it wasn't overlapping at all.
Nov 07 01:21:51 <kchibisov>	But then we have certain fonts that like to draw out of bounds, so you should honor them...
Nov 07 01:22:08 <UndeadLeech>	Huh, it seems to render things bolder?
Nov 07 01:22:23 <kchibisov>	You mean in general or when it overlaps?
Nov 07 01:22:47 <UndeadLeech>	https://paste.rs/kls.png
Nov 07 01:23:10 <UndeadLeech>	The subpixel RGB kinda looks wrong. In fact there doesn't seem to be any.
Nov 07 01:23:42 <kchibisov>	The strange thing is that '1' and `:` are the same.
Nov 07 01:23:55 <kchibisov>	Only vertical lines look different.
Nov 07 01:24:10 <kchibisov>	Maybe some math error, since the glyph is tight?
Nov 07 01:24:36 <kchibisov>	Like `1` has the same subpixel AA>
Nov 07 01:24:37 <UndeadLeech>	It just seemed strangely thick.
Nov 07 01:25:02 <kchibisov>	Yeah, I've noticed that as well, but wasn't sure what to expect from such lines.
Nov 07 01:25:42 <kchibisov>	You may leave a comment about that I guess, since I've also noticed it, but it was only on specific thin glyphs.
Nov 07 01:25:48 <kchibisov>	The rest looks the same, right?>
Nov 07 01:25:54 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah I'll at least ask if he knows why this is the case.
Nov 07 01:25:59 <UndeadLeech>	I haven't extensively tested this yet.
Nov 07 01:26:18 <kchibisov>	I mean, even on a picture `1` has the same red and blue things.
Nov 07 01:27:30 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, it definitely does subpixel RGB.
Nov 07 01:27:32 <kchibisov>	Also, subpixel AA blending was the hardest thing on that PR and he explicitly asked to test it.
Nov 07 01:28:13 <kchibisov>	Since our master naturally blended everything somehow, however he's certain things manually.
Nov 07 01:31:58 <UndeadLeech>	Huh, that sounds strange.
Nov 07 01:32:21 <kchibisov>	I mean, it blended due to usage of blending in shaders thing.
Nov 07 01:32:27 <kchibisov>	Which is OpenGL 3.3.
Nov 07 01:33:03 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah but the blending shouldn't be that difficult? Like you just need to blend a background color with another RGBA color.
Nov 07 01:33:16 <UndeadLeech>	That shouldn't just lead to the RGB getting lost.
Nov 07 01:34:17 <kchibisov>	it's not lost as you can see.
Nov 07 01:34:21 <kchibisov>	it's clearly there.
Nov 07 01:34:28 <kchibisov>	Just not for that char for whatever reason.
Nov 07 01:35:10 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah exactly, that's why I'm confised.
Nov 07 01:35:12 <UndeadLeech>	confused*
Nov 07 01:35:26 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure how that would be affected by the way you blend. Unless you do some pixel specific stuff.
Nov 07 01:36:12 <kchibisov>	let me check atlas
Nov 07 01:37:24 <kchibisov>	Oh, they are drawn by some other pass.
Nov 07 01:37:39 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Nov 07 01:37:47 <kchibisov>	It has 3 renderers.
Nov 07 01:37:51 <kchibisov>	grid, quad, and rects.
Nov 07 01:38:07 <kchibisov>	And lines in vim are rendered by something else, since they are not in grid atlas.
Nov 07 01:38:20 <UndeadLeech>	Huh? What do you mean?
Nov 07 01:38:26 <UndeadLeech>	They're glyphs, are they not?
Nov 07 01:38:35 <kchibisov>	yes, but they may went to different atlas.
Nov 07 01:38:49 <kchibisov>	err, different renderer.
Nov 07 01:39:05 <kchibisov>	Let me check who drawn them
Nov 07 01:39:25 <UndeadLeech>	rects is underline and stuff, right? What's the difference between grid and quad? I'd assume one of them renders the atlas'ed glyphs?
Nov 07 01:41:34 <kchibisov>	Yeah, lines were drawn by glyphrect shader.
Nov 07 01:41:50 <kchibisov>	not the grid one.
Nov 07 01:41:59 <kchibisov>	Thus they may blend things differently.
Nov 07 01:42:36 <kchibisov>	Not sure why it happened though.
Nov 07 01:44:47 <UndeadLeech>	What are these shaders there for? 
Nov 07 01:45:08 <kchibisov>	screen.f.glsl draws the entire screen, but works for good glyphs.
Nov 07 01:45:26 <kchibisov>	glyphrect.f.glsl draws bad glyphs.
Nov 07 01:45:35 <kchibisov>	And rect thing draws rects.

Nov 07 22:11:22 <kchibisov>	Also, UndeadLeech , if you will be fine with having builtin font for box drawing for which you can opt-in let me know.
Nov 07 22:12:32 <kchibisov>	Assuming that drawing without blending is overly complicated, since you need min/max blending, which is insanity.
Nov 07 22:43:11 <UndeadLeech>	Honestly I'm not completely sure anymore.
Nov 07 22:45:56 <kchibisov>	About which part? That we need opt-int builtin font?
Nov 07 22:46:07 <kchibisov>	Or that it can't be fixed with 'no blend'.
Nov 07 22:48:22 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure if there's actually any good way to fix this without providing our own font.
Nov 07 22:48:57 <kchibisov>	I mean, maybe draw the entire screen's alpha mask into texture with max blending.
Nov 07 22:49:27 <kchibisov>	And then get alpha mask from that texture instead of atlas.
Nov 07 22:50:14 <kchibisov>	Maybe with colors.
Nov 07 22:50:23 <kchibisov>	but I'm not sure if it'll work.
Nov 07 22:50:29 <UndeadLeech>	By max blending you mean taking the maximum value at each point?
Nov 07 22:50:41 <kchibisov>	yeah, opengl has such mode.
Nov 07 22:50:51 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, that's the only thing I can think of.
Nov 07 22:51:11 <kchibisov>	But it should work only on alpha masks without any colors.
Nov 07 22:51:27 <kchibisov>	But having a texture of screen size is insane.
Nov 07 22:51:36 <kchibisov>	for each frame.
Nov 07 22:51:53 <UndeadLeech>	You'd only have one texture at a time, right?
Nov 07 22:52:05 <kchibisov>	you create new each time
Nov 07 22:52:18 <kchibisov>	Since you should overlap the entire screen.
Nov 07 22:52:29 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean by that?
Nov 07 22:52:58 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you'd have to clear it every time, but you wouldn't have to keep old frames around.
Nov 07 22:53:10 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Nov 07 22:53:15 <kchibisov>	But it's insanity anyway.
Nov 07 22:54:10 <UndeadLeech>	~33MB for a 4k screen.
Nov 07 22:54:21 <kchibisov>	yeah, insanity.
Nov 07 22:55:01 <kchibisov>	And slow.
Nov 07 22:55:18 <kchibisov>	And I'm not even sure that it'll work.
Nov 07 22:55:32 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah I don't know much about GPU/OpenGL performance, but based on the bandwidth limitations we ran into with instance data that doesn't seem smart.
Nov 07 22:56:01 <kchibisov>	The problem is iGPUs.
Nov 07 22:56:13 <kchibisov>	also, we may remove instance rendering all together.
Nov 07 22:57:21 <kchibisov>	I've talked with w23 about that like yesterday, since quad.rs is way faster than instancing and instancing is very complicated for certain CPUs/drivers.
Nov 07 22:57:45 <kchibisov>	Also, it'll use only one pass instead of 2.
Nov 07 23:00:25 <kchibisov>	But it'll be on top of master's API.
Nov 07 23:00:37 <UndeadLeech>	Also fyi I think Kitty only renders things that are within cell boundaries.
Nov 07 23:01:05 <kchibisov>	kitty does a lot of weird tricks.
Nov 07 23:01:33 <kchibisov>	Like it repositions glyphs inside cell, etc.
Nov 07 23:01:46 <kchibisov>	Just to make them 'fit'.
Nov 07 23:01:52 <UndeadLeech>	It does?
Nov 07 23:02:07 <kchibisov>	My glyphs look different in kitty with the same font size.
Nov 07 23:02:29 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, but you haven't actually looked at the code?
Nov 07 23:02:42 <UndeadLeech>	Might just be resizing glyphs, I think it could potentially be doing that.
Nov 07 23:02:48 <kchibisov>	But only with some of the fonts.
Nov 07 23:02:58 <kchibisov>	I've looked and it seems to have some logic to do so.
Nov 07 23:03:29 <kchibisov>	But I can't say more...
Nov 07 23:03:51 <kchibisov>	I just know that they are more artificially centered sometimes.
Nov 07 23:05:09 <kchibisov>	Anyway, some fonts draw glyphs outside of cell boundaries.
Nov 07 23:05:42 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but one could certainly argue those fonts are borked in a monospace context.
Nov 07 23:06:10 <kchibisov>	I mean they are monospace.
Nov 07 23:06:28 <kchibisov>	They are just a bit weird.
Nov 07 23:06:32 <UndeadLeech>	I mean they report monospace metrics, but they don't render monospace glyphs.
Nov 07 23:06:46 <UndeadLeech>	The glyph size is clearly beyond the monospace cell metrics.
Nov 07 23:06:47 <kchibisov>	They render though.
Nov 07 23:06:57 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Nov 07 23:07:10 <UndeadLeech>	Fonts don't render anything? Fonts are just fonts.
Nov 07 23:07:15 <kchibisov>	They're just slightly bigger.
Nov 07 23:07:29 <UndeadLeech>	Exactly?
Nov 07 23:07:40 <UndeadLeech>	I mean ultimately the problem is that monospace is a big fucking lie.
Nov 07 23:07:43 <kchibisov>	https://paste.rs/zXs.png
Nov 07 23:07:55 <UndeadLeech>	Because even if you maybe have a perfectly nice primary font, as soon as you get into font fallback, you're SoL.
Nov 07 23:08:06 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: What's that?
Nov 07 23:08:40 <kchibisov>	An example of drawing slightly above.
Nov 07 23:08:46 <kchibisov>	A monospace font.
Nov 07 23:09:00 <kchibisov>	And yeah, kitty cuts it.
Nov 07 23:09:22 <kchibisov>	Looks just awfully bad.
Nov 07 23:09:34 <UndeadLeech>	That just looks like a shitty font.
Nov 07 23:09:50 <kchibisov>	I mean, it doesn't matter, why it cuts the glyph.
Nov 07 23:10:21 <kchibisov>	You can't just define a list of monospace fonts users can use.
Nov 07 23:10:41 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you can absolutely say you don't support fonts that are not behaving properly.
Nov 07 23:10:46 <UndeadLeech>	Like proportional fonts.
Nov 07 23:10:56 <kchibisov>	Yeah, but this font is clearly a monospace one.
Nov 07 23:11:02 <UndeadLeech>	It's not.
Nov 07 23:11:06 <kchibisov>	It's.
Nov 07 23:11:11 <UndeadLeech>	It claims to be a monospace font.
Nov 07 23:11:16 <UndeadLeech>	You can claim whatever you want.
Nov 07 23:11:36 <kchibisov>	It just uses as much from the cell as it can.
Nov 07 23:11:48 <UndeadLeech>	Only because you report monospace metrics, doesn't mean you have a functional monospace font.
Nov 07 23:12:07 <UndeadLeech>	If you render outside of the cell, you use MORE from the cell than you can.
Nov 07 23:12:17 <UndeadLeech>	Which is clearly incorrect, because you're reporting incorrect metrics at that point.
Nov 07 23:12:24 <UndeadLeech>	Incorrect metrics => your font is broken.
Nov 07 23:12:25 <kchibisov>	it's not outside of cell, it's outside of cell you've picked for it.
Nov 07 23:12:38 <kchibisov>	monospace font is the one that has the same advance for each char.
Nov 07 23:12:39 <UndeadLeech>	That is based on the metrics reported by the font though?
Nov 07 23:12:40 <kchibisov>	nothing more.
Nov 07 23:12:44 <kchibisov>	there's nothing about fitting into cell.
Nov 07 23:12:59 <kchibisov>	It depends what metrics are you using.
Nov 07 23:13:09 <UndeadLeech>	I can make you a monospace font that will never work on any computer.
Nov 07 23:13:14 <kchibisov>	There's literally a PR on crossfont that makes this font always fit into cell.
Nov 07 23:13:15 <UndeadLeech>	That's 100% the fonts fault.
Nov 07 23:13:23 <UndeadLeech>	Having the correct advance is not sufficient for a functional font.
Nov 07 23:13:38 <kchibisov>	Please, show me a paper that defined functional font.
Nov 07 23:14:01 <UndeadLeech>	Why the fuck would some random paper have authority over that?
Nov 07 23:14:13 <kchibisov>	I mean, what is functional font?
Nov 07 23:14:37 <kchibisov>	And what metrics should define the cell size you'll be using?
Nov 07 23:15:02 <UndeadLeech>	I mean feel free to read the freetype documentation.
Nov 07 23:15:05 <kchibisov>	And why require monospace fonts to be rendered inside grid.
Nov 07 23:15:13 <kchibisov>	I've read, nothing about cell.
Nov 07 23:15:30 <UndeadLeech>	That's completely incorrect. The glyph metrics are very well defined.
Nov 07 23:15:31 <kchibisov>	And vte terminals are using other metrics.
Nov 07 23:15:37 <UndeadLeech>	https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/metrics.png
Nov 07 23:16:05 <UndeadLeech>	If you report the same metrics for every glyph, but you have content drawn outside those metrics, your font is broken.
Nov 07 23:16:25 <kchibisov>	it's not like that, metric is per glyph.
Nov 07 23:17:18 <UndeadLeech>	I mean either way this isn't going anywhere. I have zero interest in supporting fonts that are broken.
Nov 07 23:17:30 <UndeadLeech>	If you want a font to draw at random heights, use a different terminal.
Nov 07 23:17:49 <kchibisov>	How you'll render cjk?
Nov 07 23:18:05 <UndeadLeech>	?
Nov 07 23:18:17 <UndeadLeech>	Why would cjk pose a problem? That reports correctly as fullwidth.
Nov 07 23:18:30 <kchibisov>	Like you should start picking fallback fonts with similar metrics.
Nov 07 23:19:05 <UndeadLeech>	I did talk about this problem already.
Nov 07 23:19:05 <kchibisov>	In the end you'll have kitty's font rendering stack.
Nov 07 23:19:21 <UndeadLeech>	Why does that matter?
Nov 07 23:19:23 <kchibisov>	Since the picking nearest my metrics is what they do for sure.
Nov 07 23:19:42 <UndeadLeech>	They don't?
Nov 07 23:19:45 <kchibisov>	I'm just acknowlading that it's a valid thing to do.
Nov 07 23:19:55 <kchibisov>	I swear I saw this logic there.
Nov 07 23:20:13 <kchibisov>	recentering -> not sure, picking nearest -> for sure.
Nov 07 23:20:16 <UndeadLeech>	I mean when looking at the font fallback for emojis they were delegating the fallback to fontconfig.
Nov 07 23:20:31 <kchibisov>	They use fallback from fontconfig.
Nov 07 23:20:34 <UndeadLeech>	Just put an 'emoji' in the pattern.
Nov 07 23:20:55 <kchibisov>	but then they try varios font sizes until they find nearest for that font.
Nov 07 23:21:00 <kchibisov>	that's likely why they don't support bitmap fonts.
Nov 07 23:21:15 <UndeadLeech>	Sure.
Nov 07 23:21:25 <UndeadLeech>	But they don't skip fonts in fallback that aren't the correct metrics.
Nov 07 23:21:42 <UndeadLeech>	Picking font sizes that more closely match your primary font isn't really a bad idea.
Nov 07 23:21:42 <kchibisov>	Yes, they just try them unless they match primary font.
Nov 07 23:21:58 <kchibisov>	I've told you about that in the past, you said that it's bad idea.
Nov 07 23:22:12 <kchibisov>	I was even tempted to implement it at some point iirc.
Nov 07 23:22:14 <UndeadLeech>	It's just unnecessarily complicated.
Nov 07 23:22:26 <UndeadLeech>	But it makes sense why someone would want to do it.
Nov 07 23:22:29 <kchibisov>	Likely when I was touching crossfont a lot.
Nov 07 23:23:28 <kchibisov>	Also, if you don't want to support drawing outside of glyph boundaries at all, mention that on 'new renderer' thing.
Nov 07 23:24:03 <kchibisov>	It'll make the life so much easier.
Nov 07 23:27:23 <kchibisov>	But kitty supports drawing out side of cell boundaries actually.
Nov 07 23:27:27 <kchibisov>	But horizontally.
Nov 07 23:27:51 <kchibisov>	https://paste.rs/9be.png
Nov 07 23:32:39 <kchibisov>	But you may treatf those glyphs as full width when drawing actually, so you'll still crop them, but differently. 
Nov 07 23:32:58 <UndeadLeech>	Oh I generally don't think it's a good idea to ban rendering outside of cell boundaries. I'm just spitballing.
Nov 07 23:33:49 <kchibisov>	I mean, the easiest solution is to provide opt-in for builtin font.
Nov 07 23:34:12 <kchibisov>	even implementing it is easy.
Nov 07 23:34:26 <kchibisov>	Just time consuming.
Nov 07 23:34:38 <kchibisov>	since we have literally everything for it to work.
Nov 07 23:44:45 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Nov 07 23:44:50 <UndeadLeech>	Though easiest != best.
Nov 07 23:44:55 <UndeadLeech>	Not necessarily at least.
Nov 07 23:46:05 <kchibisov>	It depends though, it'll be the best when it'll come to aligning stuff.
Nov 07 23:46:15 <kchibisov>	And will work with arbitrary line heigh.
Nov 07 23:46:18 <kchibisov>	line height*

Nov 08 07:14:34 <UndeadLeech>	At that point you can also return an error, but neither helps with not returning the correct missing glyph symbol.
Nov 08 07:14:55 <kchibisov>	No, you return Error(RasterizedGlyph)
Nov 08 07:15:04 <UndeadLeech>	What?
Nov 08 07:15:23 <kchibisov>	Err, Error::MissingGlyph(RasterizedGlyph)
Nov 08 07:15:36 <kchibisov>	And this error is a missing symbol.
Nov 08 07:15:47 <kchibisov>	I mean, your missing glyph is right there.
Nov 08 07:15:49 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, gotcha. You mean returning the proper rasterized glyph but actually attaching the missing glyph symbol as data.
Nov 08 07:15:56 <kchibisov>	Yes.
Nov 08 07:16:14 <UndeadLeech>	I mean that API would be a bit annoying to use, but it's an option.
Nov 08 07:16:26 <kchibisov>	it won't.
Nov 08 07:16:42 <kchibisov>	You're alreadyd using Result there, just chain on unwrap.
Nov 08 07:16:46 <UndeadLeech>	How wouldn't it be? Now you have to handle three separate cases and remap them all differently.
Nov 08 07:17:43 <kchibisov>	\0 helps, since you can clearly know that if you have \0 in char field for rasterized glyph, it's missing.
Nov 08 07:17:50 <UndeadLeech>	No.
Nov 08 07:18:09 <kchibisov>	Hm?
Nov 08 07:18:29 <kchibisov>	Unless you have a glyph for \0 actually.
Nov 08 07:18:32 <UndeadLeech>	You know it's missing when it's an error anyways.
Nov 08 07:18:49 <kchibisov>	No, I mean in approach without error.
Nov 08 07:19:06 <kchibisov>	Like if glyph is missing you set its char to '\0'.
Nov 08 07:19:11 <UndeadLeech>	No way we return \0 as an error in an Ok result.
Nov 08 07:19:14 <UndeadLeech>	That's insane.
Nov 08 07:19:53 <kchibisov>	I mean I prefer the Error thing more.
Nov 08 07:20:35 <kchibisov>	Other than that I don't think there's an option to make it work.
Nov 08 07:20:48 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, but it'll me `get_glyph.unwrap_or_else(|err| match err { Missing(glyph) => glyph, _ => Default::default() })`.
Nov 08 07:20:50 <UndeadLeech>	That's messy.
Nov 08 07:21:48 <kchibisov>	Well, assuming that you'll use that in one place in your program.
Nov 08 07:22:04 <kchibisov>	Also, we can add a helper for that error.
Nov 08 07:23:10 <kchibisov>	Though, it won't really help.
Nov 08 07:24:16 <kchibisov>	The problem is that you can't identify if the glyph is missing.
Nov 08 07:24:30 <kchibisov>	I mean if the glyph you return is missing.
Nov 08 07:24:56 <kchibisov>	You may add a bool flag that it's missing glyph, but it'll increase a size of rasterized glyph.
Nov 08 07:25:46 <kchibisov>	So as an alternative I've suggest to add a fn is_missing(&self) { self.c == '\0' } and set '\0' for those missing glyphs.
Nov 08 07:26:13 <UndeadLeech>	No.
Nov 08 07:26:46 <kchibisov>	Exactly, so error approach is the only option that fits.
Nov 08 07:27:24 <UndeadLeech>	I mean I haven't looked into this yet and I don't plan to today, but from the ones you've suggested that's the only acceptable one at least.
Nov 08 07:27:56 <kchibisov>	I mean, just by judging how freetype backend works.
Nov 08 07:28:34 <kchibisov>	And that we should return missing glyph.

Jan 27 18:57:51 <BataLoopPak>	Oh, you're right

Feb 01 13:39:29 <UndeadLeech>	I've considered it, but I'm not entirely sure. Since the impact of that bug is relatively low.

Feb 01 20:07:49 <lovesegfault>	UndeadLeech: it broke a whole bunch of my scripts :/
Feb 01 20:08:24 <lovesegfault>	b/c I use a pattern of launching alacritty with fzf to select something, then write that to a fifo file in /tmp which gets picked up by the spawning proc
Feb 01 20:08:35 <lovesegfault>	but the spawning proc started failing since alacritty would segfault
Feb 01 20:08:59 <lovesegfault>	a simple || true solved it, but regardless it took me a while to figure out what was happening :P

Feb 09 15:07:30 <nixpulvis>	Hey. Thought I'd swing by today, sorry I have been slow on responding to #4768. I'm still reading it over and testing some basic things. I have a few comments so far, but I'll try and write them up on the PR later today.
Feb 09 15:13:44 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: Glad you came here to comment, I was about to give it another review myself and just merge it since you didn't say anything.
Feb 09 15:20:15 <nixpulvis>	Yea, sorry I've been a bit MIA. Life has been getting in the way.
Feb 09 15:20:41 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you have no obligation to be around lol. Just nice to have a second opinion.
Feb 09 15:21:59 <nixpulvis>	On an unrelated note, did you see this: https://bradbarrows.com/post/alacrittytabs
Feb 09 15:22:31 <UndeadLeech>	If that's related to the PR I've seen the other day, I'd rather not look at it.
Feb 09 15:22:39 <nixpulvis>	It's a shame he didn't just figure out how macOS tabs work.
Feb 09 15:23:01 <nixpulvis>	fair enough. I was very confused by the PR at a glance too.
Feb 09 15:23:19 <UndeadLeech>	It was very strange indeed.
Feb 09 15:23:59 <UndeadLeech>	Also reading the description here, that sounds completely unfunctional lol.
Feb 09 15:24:00 <nixpulvis>	He claims performanve improvements by testing with `time find ~/repos/llvm-project`.
Feb 09 15:24:12 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah that's not a test.
Feb 09 15:24:32 <UndeadLeech>	And it sounds like he's trying to write without synchronization with the terminal (no locking), which will prevent things like ctrl+c from working properly.
Feb 09 15:24:37 <UndeadLeech>	It just doesn't work like that.
Feb 09 15:24:59 <nixpulvis>	I didn't even bother trying it out TBH.
Feb 09 15:25:13 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it doesn't build, I didn't try it either.
Feb 09 15:25:20 <UndeadLeech>	But the changes make little sense.
Feb 09 15:25:44 <nixpulvis>	even if they made sense, tabs should really be at a higher level than the grid.
Feb 09 15:26:59 <UndeadLeech>	I mean yeah, alacritty_terminal shouldn't be touched.
Feb 09 15:27:29 <nixpulvis>	Anyway, I might try and be around here more IDK. But let me at least figure out this sync escape thing now.
Feb 09 15:27:57 <UndeadLeech>	Whatever floats your boat. You're aware of the escape sequence and how it should work?
Feb 09 15:28:14 <UndeadLeech>	I haven't given it a full test after sending the PR iirc, so it might still be somewhat broken.
Feb 09 15:28:36 <UndeadLeech>	I'm mostly concerned about performance problems because I've been playing around with different versions for months with zero progress.
Feb 09 15:29:09 <UndeadLeech>	Since unfortunately I see no way to do this other than branching in every byte of the parser, which is obviously very expensive.
Feb 09 15:47:47 <nixpulvis>	I think I understand how this works now, more or less.
Feb 09 15:48:03 <UndeadLeech>	Hah, you mean my code or the escape sequence itself?
Feb 09 15:48:15 <nixpulvis>	I want to give it a quick sanity check, but I fear I'm messing up my DSC string.
Feb 09 15:48:19 <nixpulvis>	Both ;)
Feb 09 15:49:27 <nixpulvis>	Would there be a way to avoid the conditional with another vtable lookup?
Feb 09 15:50:07 <nixpulvis>	essentially dynamic dispatch on the `parser`? 
Feb 09 15:51:00 <nixpulvis>	I'm not even sure that would actually be any faster in this case.
Feb 09 15:54:06 <UndeadLeech>	Dynamic dispatch is slower than branching. 
Feb 09 15:54:18 <UndeadLeech>	Had the same idea, expected the lookup to be slower so I tested it. It is indeed.

Feb 09 15:59:50 <UndeadLeech>	That's why I think doing it in the parser is the only solution.
Feb 09 15:59:57 <nixpulvis>	Wait... if you *are* frozen, you should be fine.
Feb 09 16:00:09 <UndeadLeech>	No, because you might be frozen too early.
Feb 09 16:00:25 <nixpulvis>	Oh I see what you mean
Feb 09 16:00:27 <UndeadLeech>	Imagine someone writes content synchronized, then a popup, then freezes until the user does input.
Feb 09 16:00:37 <UndeadLeech>	You might never see that popup if you freeze on the first frame.
Feb 09 16:00:51 <nixpulvis>	you need the conditional in the parser one way or another to keep the most forward frozen state.
Feb 09 16:00:53 <UndeadLeech>	So the application would wait for user feedback and the user would wait for application feedback.
Feb 09 16:00:58 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Feb 09 16:01:54 <nixpulvis>	Quick sanity check: `echo -e '\eP=1s'` should enable, and s/1/2 should disable fully?
Feb 09 16:02:11 <nixpulvis>	oh plus the '\\` at the end of each.
Feb 09 16:02:23 <nixpulvis>	I still feel like I'm not terminating correctly.
Feb 09 16:02:31 <UndeadLeech>	You need ST at the end, so \e\\.
Feb 09 16:02:36 <nixpulvis>	OH
Feb 09 16:02:40 <nixpulvis>	\e\\ is ST.
Feb 09 16:02:54 <UndeadLeech>	But you should probably do \e\x5c, because bash seems to struggle with recognizing what you're escaping when you do \e\\"
Feb 09 16:03:06 <UndeadLeech>	Well zsh, not bash.
Feb 09 16:03:07 <nixpulvis>	smart
Feb 09 16:03:20 <nixpulvis>	though, fish doesn't care
Feb 09 16:03:34 <UndeadLeech>	It would have been smart if I managed to figure it out before running into the issue like 9 times.
Feb 09 16:04:21 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, it's stuff like `\eP=1s\e\\test` that creates troubles.
Feb 09 16:05:02 <nixpulvis>	ah. I'm writing seperate echos with some sleeps in between atm.
Feb 09 16:05:17 <nixpulvis>	confirmed iTerm works at least at a basic level ;)
Feb 09 16:05:31 <UndeadLeech>	Might work too. Just saying I've completely switched to \x5c because I'm not having half my tests invalidated because the escape sequence wasn't parsed properly.

Feb 10 14:31:27 <peschk_l>	hello :)  the last alacritty version (0.7.1) caused my cursor to always blink when I'm using emacs, even with "cursor.style.blinking" set to "Never". I never had this issue with another terminal emulator (tried gnome-terminal, lxterminal amd xterm). In the end, the fix was a specific option in the emacs config. Since I suspect that other people
Feb 10 14:31:28 <peschk_l>	might get this issue as well, so I'd like to add this information to the documentation, if that's okay with the maintainers. What would the right place be ? A comment in the reference config file ? Or maybe in a Q&A section in the wiki ?
Feb 10 14:41:17 <rcf>	peschk_l: open an issue, it's definitely a bug. 
Feb 10 14:41:52 <rcf>	If never is even an option, it should only exist to prevent cvvis from having an effect. 
Feb 10 14:44:51 <peschk_l>	rcf: I dont know, looks like emacs does some weid stuff with the cursor: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NonBlinkingCursor . Maybe it hides the terminal's cursor to provide its own ? But you're right I'll open an issue, so can at least have the fix written down somewhere
Feb 10 14:45:46 <rcf>	peschk_l: you can reproduce the issue at a normal prompt with `tput cvvis`
Feb 10 14:47:07 <rcf>	Or rather, can you do this?

Feb 11 20:27:20 <Yaniel>	belak: Terminus is a bitmap font IIRC so the obvious answer would be that you set its size in px
Feb 11 20:33:06 <belak>	Yaniel: yes, terminus is a bitmap font, however it does the exact same thing with the Terminus (TTF) version
Feb 11 20:33:39 *	Yaniel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 11 20:33:50 <Yaniel>	also, does xft know your DPI or does alacritty get it from somewhere else?
Feb 11 20:34:03 <belak>	I haven't set my DPI anywhere explicitly
Feb 11 20:35:14 <belak>	Gnome applications, KDE applications, Emacs, all need 12 set for the size... Alacritty for some reason needs it to be 7 to match everything else...
Feb 11 20:35:32 <belak>	That's Xft, Pango, and whatever KDE uses
Feb 11 20:36:25 <belak>	I think something is off with Alacritty because even Source Code Pro at size 12 is massive
Feb 11 20:37:26 <Yaniel>	I have uhh
Feb 11 20:37:48 <Yaniel>	Hack at 11.0 in alacritty
Feb 11 20:39:42 <belak>	1 sec, I'll post a screenshot
Feb 11 20:40:17 <belak>	https://thelounge.elwert.cloud/uploads/d03ed0ad454db519/2021-02-11-113927_1920x1080_scrot.png 
Feb 11 20:40:58 <belak>	That seems... huge
Feb 11 20:41:33 <Yaniel>	can you get some console output from alacritty
Feb 11 20:41:50 <Yaniel>	that looks a lot like it's getting a DPI scale factor of 2 from somewhere
Feb 11 20:42:21 <belak>	What log level?
Feb 11 20:42:40 <Yaniel>	and fwiw, forcing a random piece of text to use the same font and same pt size in firefox dev tools makes it the same size as in alacritty for me
Feb 11 20:43:11 <belak>	Yeah, device pixel ratio 1.66666667
Feb 11 20:43:14 <belak>	Good call
Feb 11 20:43:33 <Yaniel>	there we go
Feb 11 20:43:46 <belak>	That seems off
Feb 11 20:45:55 <belak>	Wait, is alacritty a Wayland app?
Feb 11 20:46:03 <belak>	I wonder if running it inside X is confusing it somehow
Feb 11 20:46:23 <belak>	Ah, no I see || is_x11
Feb 11 20:46:28 <Yaniel>	alacritty can use either
Feb 11 20:46:52 <Yaniel>	but xwayland may be confused about the device pixel ratio
Feb 11 20:47:11 <Yaniel>	are your reference applications running on native wayland?
Feb 11 20:48:32 <belak>	I'm running in X and I don't think I have Xwayland set up
Feb 11 20:49:10 <belak>	I can try adding some extra logging
Feb 11 20:49:34 <Yaniel>	just need to find where alacritty is getting that DPR from now
Feb 11 20:50:01 <belak>	Ok, yeah, is_x11 is true
Feb 11 20:55:13 <Yaniel>	does xrandr report your screen's physical dimensions correctly?
Feb 11 20:57:06 <Yaniel>	either way you can override it with the WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR env variable
Feb 11 20:57:43 <belak>	It looks like it...    1920x1080     60.00*+  59.93    48.00  
Feb 11 20:57:57 <Yaniel>	no I mean the physical size
Feb 11 20:57:59 <Yaniel>	not pixel size
Feb 11 20:59:50 <belak>	Yeah, 300mm x 170mm - it's not exact, but they're off by less than 5mm each
Feb 11 21:00:14 <belak>	eDP1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 300mm x 170mm
Feb 11 21:01:15 <belak>	Yes, forcing the scale factor to 1 seems to have the intended result
Feb 11 21:01:50 <Yaniel>	maybe other applications just ignore the screen size vs resolution, while alacritty adjusts itself to account for that
Feb 11 21:01:59 <Yaniel>	I recall X11 being absolute garbage when it comes to this
Feb 11 21:02:17 <belak>	From what I can tell, the ratio comes directly from the monitor itself
Feb 11 21:02:50 <belak>	https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty/src/display/mod.rs#L196
Feb 11 21:03:58 <belak>	Both estimated dpr, and dpr are the same
Feb 11 21:04:07 <belak>	At least for this case
Feb 11 21:14:25 <belak>	I have to admit, I'm not particularly sure where this value is coming from
Feb 11 21:26:22 <belak>	All this FFI stuff is a bit obtuse... there's nothing in the underlying X11 lib that references scale_factor
Feb 11 21:45:52 <belak>	It looks like the code is in winit for anyone looking for it... The calc_dpi_factor function seems like a bunch of magic variables (at least without comments)
Feb 11 21:51:59 <belak>	I think someone misplaced a decimal in winit
Feb 11 21:53:33 <belak>	Is there a way in rust to replace a dep with a local copy?
Feb 11 21:58:24 <belak>	That was it
Feb 11 21:59:06 <belak>	Wait, maybe not
Feb 11 22:08:37 <belak>	Ok, it looks like your guess was right Yaniel - winit (and in extension alacritty) calculates a scaling factor based on the size of the display and the resolution... for some reason, nothing else seems to respect this
Feb 11 22:09:07 <belak>	The calculations are right (but I thought they were wrong because of a weird decimal in some unit conversion)
Feb 11 22:14:38 <belak>	I think for a while GTK didn't have fractional scaling, so I wonder if they just floored the calculated scaling factor rather than rounding to the nearest 1/12 like winit does
Feb 11 22:23:17 <belak>	Is there a way to specify different fonts on different platforms?
Feb 11 22:47:32 <frebib>	I managed to make Alacritty DPI behave fine on X11
Feb 11 22:47:56 <frebib>	belak: Did you set Xft.dpi in xrdb?
Feb 11 22:48:22 <belak>	I just overrode the WINIT_X11_SCALE_FACTOR environment variable
Feb 11 22:48:57 <frebib>	If you don't care about changing the DPI ever, then I suppose that works.
Feb 11 22:53:10 <frebib>	If you care about correctness or reasoning, this might help
Feb 11 22:53:10 <frebib>	https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/commit/4515b77aa51c98f49387c0118de0bfecf3634422
Feb 11 23:24:25 <belak>	I'll care about that eventually, but this fixes it for now and I don't have the time to keep fighting it lol
Feb 11 23:24:39 <belak>	I don't currently have any monitors that need to be at higher DPIs
Feb 12 00:08:29 <UndeadLeech>	QT has the option to calculate the DPR too, but alacritty is the only X11 app I'm aware of that does it by default.

Feb 12 10:28:35 <betaboon>	hello #alacritty, I'm running sway and just noticed that setting $XCURSOR_SIZE results in the cursor being half as big in alacritty than everywhere else. what could be the reason for that ? 
Feb 12 10:29:21 <UndeadLeech>	You mean by setting the cursor size, the cursor size changed?
Feb 12 10:30:23 <betaboon>	UndeadLeech: i mean when running `XCURSOR_SIZE=50 alacritty` the cursor size ends up being half as big as on other programs that are started with `XCURSOR_SIZE=50`
Feb 12 10:30:38 <UndeadLeech>	Which version?
Feb 12 10:32:05 <betaboon>	built against PR4763
Feb 12 10:32:56 <betaboon>	which is 4 commits ahead of master
Feb 12 10:33:47 <UndeadLeech>	Which "other applications" are you testing with?
Feb 12 10:35:42 <betaboon>	UndeadLeech: swaybg, waybar, firefox (in wayland mode), pcmanfm and several electron-based applications running in xwayland mode
Feb 12 10:36:07 <betaboon>	and wofi
Feb 12 10:36:35 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx any idea? Most of that seems to be GTK stuff though, which might have a separate configuration option for cursor size.
Feb 12 10:37:06 <Levanx>	Is it on an hidpi monitor ?
Feb 12 10:37:34 <betaboon>	UndeadLeech: yeah all the gtk-applications are configured using gsettings, but the xwayland applications should use XCURSOR_SIZE
Feb 12 10:37:37 <UndeadLeech>	Does sctk scale the cursor size by dpi when other applications do not?
Feb 12 10:37:54 <betaboon>	Levanx: 1080p
Feb 12 10:37:57 <UndeadLeech>	xwayland always sounds fishy.
Feb 12 10:38:24 <UndeadLeech>	DPI is all about pixels per inch, so 1080p alone says nothing.
Feb 12 10:38:55 <Levanx>	I mean, the screen scale factor is 1
Feb 12 10:39:03 <Levanx>	so it's not an hidpi issue
Feb 12 10:39:22 <Levanx>	(things being half the expected size often sound like hidpi issues)
Feb 12 10:39:51 <betaboon>	UndeadLeech: sorry. i always get confused in the hidpi area. my screen has 166ppi
Feb 12 10:40:12 <UndeadLeech>	In sway you have to set the DPI manually, right? So the actual monitor DPI shouldn't matter?
Feb 12 10:41:38 <betaboon>	UndeadLeech: i dont have the dpi set manually anywhere. i would expect sway/wlroots to detect that automatically
Feb 12 10:42:08 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure it does, but I don't use sway. I know you can set it manually if you want to though.
Feb 12 10:46:39 <betaboon>	XCURSOR_SIZE is being consumed by sctk, right ?
Feb 12 10:47:23 <UndeadLeech>	It might not be sctk directly, but somewhere in that chain.

Feb 12 13:25:30 <Levanx>	But this biases it in favor of choosing smaller images

Feb 12 21:11:19 <capin>	i'm trying to map `C-S-M` in tmux that's control+shift+meta ie. alt on a mbp keyboard in tmux as my prefix2, presently it's not working. how would i get al to pass that keybinding forward to tmux?
Feb 12 21:16:02 <UndeadLeech>	Option on macOS is a bit broken.
Feb 12 21:18:29 <capin>	not sure what that means? i posted this a while back, https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/93#issuecomment-429651216 and have had success using option aka meta on macos in the past. is there a way i can further troubleshoot this?
Feb 12 21:19:16 <UndeadLeech>	Wait, what are you trying to map ctrl+shift+alt to?
Feb 12 21:19:27 <UndeadLeech>	That's just modifiers.
Feb 12 21:19:52 <capin>	ohhh are you saying i can't just map modifiers by themselves?
Feb 12 21:20:03 <UndeadLeech>	Not really.
Feb 12 21:20:07 <capin>	i was hoping to use ctrl+shift+alt as my prefix2 for tmux
Feb 12 21:20:10 <UndeadLeech>	Not sure what you're trying to do.
Feb 12 21:20:28 <capin>	(insert exploration gfx)
Feb 12 21:21:44 <capin>	okay, so when i was reading this, https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/329157/33002 is that why he appends `f12` to the custom key mapping?
Feb 12 21:22:04 <UndeadLeech>	Maybe.
Feb 12 21:22:20 <capin>	it seems akin to what you stated above
Feb 12 21:23:04 <capin>	so if i wanted that mapping in my setup, is there anything special i need to do to get al to pass that along to tmux?
Feb 12 21:23:05 <UndeadLeech>	Also ctrl/ctrl+shift is usually the same.
Feb 12 21:23:45 <capin>	i'm content with using `S-M-C-f12` if i can get it to work
Feb 12 21:35:17 <capin>	if i want to use f12 on a macbook keyboard do i have "specifiy/declare" the function key as well?

Feb 13 19:17:48 <UndeadLeech>	Using ctrl+shift+c/v?
Feb 13 19:17:58 <UndeadLeech>	Check the config for default bindings.
Feb 13 19:18:40 <cjoke>	no, not happening. im looking at the ~/.alacritty.yml file I did copy from gitsource now. 
Feb 13 19:19:04 <UndeadLeech>	What OS/DE?

Feb 14 18:22:20 <nixpulvis>	UndeadLeech, if you're around perhaps I can take some of my search/hint/vi mode stuff offline, since it's only partially related to this PR at hand.
Feb 14 18:23:09 <nixpulvis>	I hope I'm not coming off overly critical. I'm very happy to see you've implemented link hints.
Feb 14 18:27:58 <UndeadLeech>	I am around indeed.
Feb 14 18:28:28 <UndeadLeech>	In which scenario would you want to launch this before the stuff you're matching is even visible?
Feb 14 18:28:58 <nixpulvis>	Watching a log.
Feb 14 18:29:33 <nixpulvis>	I'm not saying I generally would *want* to do this. I just think if my muscle memory triggers the mode before the input is in yet, it should still work.
Feb 14 18:29:56 <UndeadLeech>	I honestly think that would just be pointlessly confusing. I don't see much benefit blowing it up to be such a completely separate big "mode" you operate in and have to get back out of.
Feb 14 18:30:19 <nixpulvis>	But it already *is*.
Feb 14 18:30:29 <UndeadLeech>	I don't see how.
Feb 14 18:30:55 <UndeadLeech>	In fact I've actually considered completely freezing the viewport, it's just that it coincidentally works just fine without doing so.
Feb 14 18:31:03 <nixpulvis>	If my keys don't act as they normally do, I'm in a mode.
Feb 14 18:31:28 <UndeadLeech>	What is normal?
Feb 14 18:31:34 <UndeadLeech>	Does launching vim put you in a different terminal mode?
Feb 14 18:31:42 <nixpulvis>	~Vi, ~Search...
Feb 14 18:32:22 <nixpulvis>	Since launching vim puts me in the Alt buffer, yes. I can have seperate bindings for that mode.
Feb 14 18:32:24 <UndeadLeech>	I'd say the way it is right now is much more convenient for someone who's familiar with the feature.
Feb 14 18:32:37 <UndeadLeech>	It's supposed to be a quick in and out.
Feb 14 18:33:03 <nixpulvis>	Yet unlike Vi mode which I can enter and leave without moving my fingers, I must reach for ESC?
Feb 14 18:33:33 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure what you mean? By default you should leave this mode by selecting your match.
Feb 14 18:33:47 <UndeadLeech>	Pressing escape to get out of it should be the exception. 
Feb 14 18:33:47 <nixpulvis>	I'm just saying, there's something fundamentally inconsistent about the way we move around in Alacritty.
Feb 14 18:33:56 <UndeadLeech>	Also if you have to move your fingers to press esc, that's on you. :)
Feb 14 18:34:16 <nixpulvis>	I have caps-lock = esc.
Feb 14 18:34:22 <UndeadLeech>	Consistent or not, this is just the most pratical approach as far as I can see.
Feb 14 18:34:52 <nixpulvis>	I don't see how I've made things less practical with my suggestions, just a bit more implementation changes.
Feb 14 18:35:06 <UndeadLeech>	It just makes things more cumbersome.
Feb 14 18:35:21 <UndeadLeech>	You get stuff into my way that has no pratcical benefit to me.
Feb 14 18:35:32 <nixpulvis>	What is in your way?
Feb 14 18:35:50 <UndeadLeech>	If I thought there was a match and there is none, I now have to exit explicitly.
Feb 14 18:36:10 <UndeadLeech>	I previously was able to see everything, now there's an indicator in my way that doesn't tell me anything I don't know already.
Feb 14 18:36:38 <UndeadLeech>	As far as I can see, the changes only do harm.
Feb 14 18:38:13 <nixpulvis>	If you thought there was a match and there is none, I would hope to get some kind of negative feedback.
Feb 14 18:38:21 <nixpulvis>	Maybe we just ring the bell...
Feb 14 18:38:31 <UndeadLeech>	I mean I agree that negative feedback would be helpful, same with search, but it's only helpful if it doesn't annoy the fuck out of me.
Feb 14 18:38:31 <nixpulvis>	but I have that turned off...
Feb 14 18:38:48 <UndeadLeech>	Like what Kitty does for example is it throws away my entire buffer and prints a message in the top left saying there's no match.
Feb 14 18:38:55 <UndeadLeech>	I'd rather have nothing than that.
Feb 14 18:39:00 <nixpulvis>	that sounds horrible.
Feb 14 18:39:06 <UndeadLeech>	I personally think it is.
Feb 14 18:39:23 <UndeadLeech>	But that's an issue that applies both to search and hints I suppose.
Feb 14 18:39:47 <nixpulvis>	Plus, what if I want to scroll while hinting?
Feb 14 18:39:59 <UndeadLeech>	Also since you mentioned the key_bindings section: In the future I want to add more fields that use these hints for the mouse highlighting.
Feb 14 18:40:14 <nixpulvis>	seems easy enough to color the scroll indicator with the hint color or something.
Feb 14 18:40:32 <UndeadLeech>	Something like mouse_modifiers which automatically causes hints to be used for the mouse when it is enabled with the specified bindings.
Feb 14 18:40:59 <nixpulvis>	wait... I don't think I follow.
Feb 14 18:40:59 <UndeadLeech>	That's why I had to move it from the bindings to its own section, originally it was all in key_bindings until I moved it.
Feb 14 18:41:06 <nixpulvis>	how are hints and the mouse related?
Feb 14 18:41:24 <UndeadLeech>	Currently URLs are hardcoded into Alacritty. I want to change that. I want the hint system to be the thing that is used both for mouse and keyboard opening.
Feb 14 18:41:44 <UndeadLeech>	So you'd just define a hint for URLs and then tell Alacritty that you want to be able to open that hint with the mouse too.
Feb 14 18:42:08 <nixpulvis>	Oh I see what you mean, removing the `Open` (or whatever it's called) action.
Feb 14 18:42:28 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, pretty much.
Feb 14 18:42:45 <UndeadLeech>	Well removing what currently is hardcoded behind "open" and making it dynamic and configurable.
Feb 14 18:44:02 <UndeadLeech>	That's one of the reasons why I considered this hints approach, since I think those features integrate well with each other. I don't want to just "tack" something new on.
Feb 14 18:44:07 <UndeadLeech>	But I think this PR stands sufficiently well on its own. In the future then I'll write two new PRs for mouse stuff and for custom actions like Copy/Paste instead of command. So people don't need to rely on external tools for that.
Feb 14 18:44:07 <nixpulvis>	So this is basically just an action that takes an input, no?
Feb 14 18:44:24 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean by "this"?
Feb 14 18:46:08 <UndeadLeech>	Also I think I'm going to write up a 0.7.2 RC today. I think 0.8.0 is a long way out and I want those Wayland fixes shipped.
Feb 14 18:46:08 <nixpulvis>	Like, if (just pretend for a sec) hints was a mode, then it would be easy to make the action just configured by a regex.
Feb 14 18:46:16 <UndeadLeech>	I don't follow.
Feb 14 18:49:02 <nixpulvis>	Let me back up...
Feb 14 18:51:03 <nixpulvis>	So the goal is to make the mouse look for "enabled" hints and basically do what we do today in a user configurable way, right?
Feb 14 18:52:09 <UndeadLeech>	Basically. Though just to be clear this should always work, not only when the hint is active.
Feb 14 18:52:34 <nixpulvis>	if that's the case, then it already seems like the `command` and `regex` should be together, and the `binding` to activate the key-hint-selection state should be elsewhere, I would think part of the `key_bindings`.
Feb 14 18:54:16 <UndeadLeech>	Having it in two separate places would just be confusing though.
Feb 14 18:54:19 <nixpulvis>	Like, I would describe it as follows: Hints are always active, and the mouse underlining searches for them. You can activate a state (through a key_binding) to quick-select a hint. Since there can be many seperate hint regexes, there can be many seperate key_bindings to activate different states for each.
Feb 14 18:54:19 <UndeadLeech>	At that point you'd have to give it a name or an ID or something and then reference that ID.
Feb 14 18:54:23 <UndeadLeech>	That just seems much more difficult than necessary.
Feb 14 18:54:55 <nixpulvis>	I disagree strongly. But I do agree it's not instantly clear how to best do this.
Feb 14 18:55:02 <UndeadLeech>	It's something I've considered, but it sounds like a massive pain to configure.
Feb 14 18:55:27 <nixpulvis>	Please don't add key bindings outside the key bindings section :(
Feb 14 18:55:47 <UndeadLeech>	We already have mouse bindings outside the mouse bindings section.
Feb 14 18:55:58 <UndeadLeech>	I'd say this is much better than any alternative.
Feb 14 18:56:10 <nixpulvis>	Though that would also be fixed by this.
Feb 14 18:56:15 <UndeadLeech>	If there's a better alternative, I'm all ears.
Feb 14 18:56:20 <nixpulvis>	Unless there's more mouse bindings I'm forgetting.
Feb 14 18:56:30 <nixpulvis>	I can try to think more about it...
Feb 14 18:56:33 <UndeadLeech>	No, so it's basically the same.
Feb 14 18:57:12 <nixpulvis>	I'll take the point that you really don't want to bother with an indicator for this state. That's fine, I just think it would be a small nice thing.
Feb 14 18:58:00 <UndeadLeech>	I already hate the vi indicator. For vi mode it's just a necessary evil. But here it really isn't necessary.
Feb 14 18:58:36 <nixpulvis>	Seperating the "hint" from the "hint activation state" (better name needed) would actually help understanding this feature for newbs too. Since a "hint" is not really something one thinks would open a link, or perform any action itself.
Feb 14 18:59:16 <nixpulvis>	I say for newbs, but I litterally just mean for people learning the feature.
Feb 14 19:03:46 <nixpulvis>	re 0.7.2 RC: I can try and test it a bit later tonight.

Feb 16 23:11:49 <UndeadLeech>	with the current default it's like what? 10 matches or more and you'll get multiple.
Feb 16 23:13:42 <nixpulvis>	OK, let me try and construct a regex to test this.
Feb 16 23:13:50 <nixpulvis>	it didn't like ".+".
Feb 16 23:13:59 <UndeadLeech>	Why not?
Feb 16 23:14:14 <UndeadLeech>	That should have one match per line?
Feb 16 23:15:27 <nixpulvis>	IDK, maybe I'm doing something wrong.
Feb 16 23:15:53 <nixpulvis>	Oh boy...
Feb 16 23:15:55 <UndeadLeech>	I think you might have found a bug.
Feb 16 23:15:58 <nixpulvis>	I froze alacritty.
Feb 16 23:16:02 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure why this doesn't work anymore.
Feb 16 23:16:31 <UndeadLeech>	Same applies to search.
Feb 16 23:16:52 <UndeadLeech>	It must be the regex matching though, because I can't imagine the DFA is difficult to build.
Feb 16 23:17:35 <nixpulvis>	.* in search works for me in the RC.
Feb 16 23:17:46 <UndeadLeech>	What about .+?
Feb 16 23:17:59 <nixpulvis>	seems fine.
Feb 16 23:18:09 <UndeadLeech>	Huh.
Feb 16 23:18:21 <UndeadLeech>	It's probably my UI/terminal overhaul.
Feb 16 23:18:23 <nixpulvis>	idk why .+ is matching every line... but it's not hanging.
Feb 16 23:18:44 <UndeadLeech>	I'm on .8-dev and both hang for me.
Feb 16 23:18:47 <nixpulvis>	I guess ' ' is a .?
Feb 16 23:18:56 <UndeadLeech>	Of course, yes.
Feb 16 23:18:59 <UndeadLeech>	Space.
Feb 16 23:19:00 <nixpulvis>	right lol
Feb 16 23:19:13 <nixpulvis>	took me a second to remember what I'm doing here.
Feb 16 23:19:28 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it doesn't make much sense, but this definitely shouldn't freeze Alacritty.
Feb 16 23:19:36 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure what is hanging here.
Feb 16 23:19:41 <UndeadLeech>	Other than Alacritty of course.
Feb 16 23:21:37 <UndeadLeech>	#4800.
Feb 16 23:21:39 <nixpulvis>	yea, freezing on master,
Feb 16 23:22:19 <UndeadLeech>	Not much of a surprise that this commit broke a bunch of stuff, so it's kinda nice to cut a 0.7.2 and give this a bunch more testing.
Feb 16 23:23:53 <nixpulvis>	yea makes sense.
Feb 16 23:24:06 <nixpulvis>	Glad I can help find random bugs.
Feb 16 23:58:19 <ftpd>	Hi. iterm: https://files.insomniac.pl/Screenshot_2021-02-16_at_11.50.07_PM.png vs alacritty: https://files.insomniac.pl/Screenshot_2021-02-16_at_11.51.01_PM.png.

Feb 19 10:26:31 <UndeadLeech>	It uses the search colors.
Feb 19 10:26:40 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think that's documented.
Feb 19 10:26:43 <UndeadLeech>	colors.search.bar
Feb 19 10:34:34 <belak>	I was curious about that as well... why doesn't Gnome use the normal window decorations on Alacritty windows?
Feb 19 10:34:49 <UndeadLeech>	Because it doesn't support SSDs.
Feb 19 10:35:19 <belak>	client side decorations vs server side decorations?
Feb 19 10:35:27 <belak>	I'm not familiar with the term in this context
Feb 19 10:35:35 <UndeadLeech>	Correct.
Feb 19 10:36:42 <belak>	Blargh, yay Wayland.
Feb 19 10:36:58 <belak>	(and Gnome, they're not blameless in this either)
Feb 19 10:37:42 <UndeadLeech>	I mean gnome are literally the only ones forcing this on users.
Feb 19 10:37:50 <UndeadLeech>	Nothing to do with Wayland at a protocol level.
Feb 19 10:38:36 <belak>	I'm seriously wondering how Lagrange works then... it uses SDL and shouldn't have any specified decorations (since it doesn't use Gtk), but the titlebar is styled correctly
Feb 19 10:39:35 <belak>	Though I may be misunderstanding the problem
Feb 19 10:44:24 <belak>	My frustration with Wayland is around how much it pushes to places where they need to be implemented in multiple places. Things like client-side-decorations and moving more functionality into the compositor rather than a shared component are just examples.
Feb 19 10:45:06 <rcf>	belak: they can choose to style things differently on a per-compositor basis, or just use gtk to draw the decorations. 
Feb 19 10:45:36 <belak>	And while this specific example may be Gnome more than Wayland, it's still indirectly because of where Wayland pushes the complexity
Feb 19 10:45:46 <rcf>	I wouldn't say that. 
Feb 19 10:46:14 <rcf>	KDE and sway manage just fine. 
Feb 19 10:47:27 <rcf>	My only complain is that text rendering in the weirdly-styled CSD is now broken, which is distinct from CSD being perhaps visually unappealing and an actual bug. 
Feb 19 10:49:57 <belak>	Right, but that's my point - window drawing is now something that needs to be implemented in tons of places (once for each windowing toolkit that supports wayland) because SSD is still a protocol extension. And now because it's in 10 different places rather than relying on a window manager to draw the window decorations, they don't all line up.
Feb 19 10:51:20 <rcf>	SSD was always a protocol extension, though. No X11 window manager needs to provide it, and I would genuinely be surprised if GNOME (before dropping X entirely) did not remove it from mutter. 
Feb 19 10:53:42 <belak>	Interesting, I didn't know that
Feb 19 10:54:43 <belak>	So, why did it work in X for a Window to be decorated by the WM? I always assumed that was the default and the clients had to ask to disable it.
Feb 19 10:55:53 <belak>	I was looking at https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/217 which seems to have devolved a bit, but there are some helpful comments in there
Feb 19 10:57:18 <rcf>	Because window manager developers were not rabidly opposed to adopting the extensions as they are today. And that's largely because X11 does not try to segregate clients, and because -- being the developers of the display server itself, now -- window manager developers now need to consider whether they want the simplest possible handling of surfaces or to cater to people not using the One True
Feb 19 10:57:19 <rcf>	Toolkit™. 
Feb 19 10:57:47 <UndeadLeech>	rcf: Is it just broken for you in general?
Feb 19 10:59:13 <rcf>	UndeadLeech: strictly alacritty. It has been a common complaint among everyone reporting CSD issues, but it is often mixed up in the styling itself being off, which is indeed not a bug (or at least not one that would be reasonably solved in alacritty itself) 
Feb 19 10:59:42 <UndeadLeech>	I've only seen it in a single screenshot and that issue was complaining about it being CSDs.
Feb 19 10:59:47 <UndeadLeech>	Has this never worked for you?
Feb 19 11:00:24 <rcf>	I believe it worked in the past, given commit histories discussing (for example) default font choices for CSD titles. 
Feb 19 11:00:26 <belak>	So, the decorations in alacritty are the fallback decorations for whatever windowing toolkit alacritty uses if the Wayland compositor doesn't support whatever protocol extension is needed for SSDs?
Feb 19 11:00:36 <rcf>	belak: exactly. 
Feb 19 11:00:49 <belak>	Fun
Feb 19 11:00:51 <UndeadLeech>	I'm pretty sure CSDs texts work just fine for most people.
Feb 19 11:01:05 <UndeadLeech>	All we changed recently was prevent a crash from completely taking down alacritty when the font couldn't be loaded.
Feb 19 11:01:48 <belak>	I use a Gnome extension which hides the window titlebars when the window is tiled or maximized... and this doesn't work with Alacritty. That's how I noticed it.
Feb 19 11:02:15 <belak>	If they disappeared like other windows, it wouldn't even bother me.
Feb 19 11:02:15 <UndeadLeech>	It works just fine for me for example rcf.
Feb 19 11:02:27 <rcf>	UndeadLeech: I suppose it's the questionable font code you'd mentioned in that one issue. 
Feb 19 11:03:02 <UndeadLeech>	The thing is it shouldn't be a problem unless you have a messed up fontconfig on your system.
Feb 19 11:03:20 <rcf>	I don't actually mind too much, of course, given that I normally use sway. 
Feb 19 11:03:59 <rcf>	I just notice it when I see people complain about it now. 
Feb 19 11:05:50 <rcf>	belak: the ideal solution would be 'libdecor' or something like that which imposes no hard dependencies and does nothing but render decoration in the compositor's style on a surface. 
Feb 19 11:06:09 <UndeadLeech>	Would be nice to see if this is a consistent issue you also have with previous versions.
Feb 19 11:06:09 <belak>	Sway is another fun thing... because wlroots can't support nvidia chips (because of limitations in the proprietary nvidia driver) I can't actually use it
Feb 19 11:11:08 <rcf>	UndeadLeech: I'll definitely have a go at reproducing it with older versions and more varied (i.e. distro default) configurations and open a proper issue for it at some point. 
Feb 19 11:11:48 <belak>	rcf: hey, thanks for sticking around and giving me some background - I really appreciate it
Feb 19 11:13:53 <UndeadLeech>	rcf: Thanks.
Feb 19 11:14:28 <rcf>	belak: wlroots chose to avoid modularity to make a political statement on that matter as far as I'm concerned, but then I don't run any proprietary drivers so it doesn't bother me too much, and I"m certainly not going to try to write an eglstream backend for it. 
Feb 19 11:15:42 <belak>	rcf: I'm stuck running proprietary drivers until I can find a graphics card in stock somewhere :/
Feb 19 11:15:54 <rcf>	Of course there are massive limitations even on GNOME as far as I know -- anyone using Wine to run games, for example, is stuck with xwayland, and that means software rendering. 
Feb 19 11:15:56 <UndeadLeech>	lol, good luck with that.
Feb 19 11:16:21 <belak>	UndeadLeech: yeah, I know, lol. It's why I'm still on my 1080 from 4-ish years ago
Feb 19 11:16:41 <belak>	I've been looking semi-seriously for about 4 months now
Feb 19 11:16:46 <UndeadLeech>	I've also wanted to get a new GPU this year since I'm running a 390.
Feb 19 11:16:51 <UndeadLeech>	Though right now it's pointless.
Feb 19 11:18:50 <belak>	I assume something like a 390 would be old enough that nouveau would support it at least.
Feb 19 11:19:04 <UndeadLeech>	R9 390 is an AMD gpu, so I doubt it.
Feb 19 11:19:13 <belak>	Oh, lol
Feb 19 11:19:19 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Feb 19 11:20:02 <belak>	That's a bit better than a GTX 390 which seems to be a 10+ year old nvidia card

Feb 22 22:22:09 <UndeadLeech>	Are you on the latest version?
Feb 22 22:22:11 <nixpulvis>	What does "just a rust crash" mean?
Feb 22 22:22:23 <UndeadLeech>	Not a coredump, not an error from us.
Feb 22 22:22:30 <nixpulvis>	I was like 3 commits behind, I just updated, so I'll see if it happens again.
Feb 22 22:22:32 <UndeadLeech>	So a runtime rust crash.
Feb 22 22:22:36 <nixpulvis>	yea, right.
Feb 22 22:22:39 <nixpulvis>	gotcha
Feb 22 22:22:50 <UndeadLeech>	Were you on the search freezing fix yet?
Feb 22 22:23:26 <nixpulvis>	yes.
Feb 22 22:23:37 <nixpulvis>	99% sure anyway.
Feb 22 22:23:39 <UndeadLeech>	So you were on 3dafec0 then?
Feb 22 22:23:43 <UndeadLeech>	Hmmm.
Feb 22 22:23:52 <UndeadLeech>	What did you search for? Were you scrolled into history?
Feb 22 22:23:58 <nixpulvis>	heh not actually sure how to tell what version I was on at this point.
Feb 22 22:24:09 <nixpulvis>	Maybe I should have saved that version of the binary...
Feb 22 22:24:34 <UndeadLeech>	Do you still have any Alacritty instances open which started before the update?
Feb 22 22:24:56 <nixpulvis>	Searched for the string "true" last time, but it's been a few simple searchs like that. And I don't think I've been in scrollback, but there are a lot of lines up there.
Feb 22 22:25:05 <nixpulvis>	yea, many.
Feb 22 22:25:36 <nixpulvis>	how do I get the version of a running alacritty tho?
Feb 22 22:25:50 <UndeadLeech>	One sec, let me test if this still works.
Feb 22 22:26:02 <UndeadLeech>	I think something changed in recent years which breaks it.
Feb 22 22:26:48 <UndeadLeech>	You were searching in vi mode, right?
Feb 22 22:27:38 <UndeadLeech>	/proc/<PID>/exe --version
Feb 22 22:28:54 <nixpulvis>	not vi mode, I've been trying to see how much I can deal with the other search now too. Since my configuration for using vi-mode with ctrl+shift+f doesn't work.
Feb 22 22:29:05 <UndeadLeech>	Gotcha.
Feb 22 22:29:10 <UndeadLeech>	I'll see if I can find a crash.
Feb 22 22:30:16 <nixpulvis>	yea, 3dafec07
Feb 22 22:30:47 <nixpulvis>	this proc exe things is a great trick. I'll have to try and remember that.
Feb 22 22:31:07 <UndeadLeech>	I think I found a different bug though.
Feb 22 22:31:42 <UndeadLeech>	Not the worst thing in the world, but if you search for something and there is no match, but there was a match before you finished your regex, it will be selected.
Feb 22 22:33:25 <nixpulvis>	hmm, I can't reproduce that easily.
Feb 22 22:33:35 <UndeadLeech>	It should be trivial to reproduce.
Feb 22 22:33:40 <UndeadLeech>	You just need to make sure there's a match at first.
Feb 22 22:34:30 <nixpulvis>	I guess I don't understand.
Feb 22 22:35:49 <UndeadLeech>	https://paste.rs/YZB.mp4
Feb 22 22:36:09 <UndeadLeech>	Also starting search and quitting immediately shouldn't move the content down a line iirc.
Feb 22 22:36:10 <nixpulvis>	oh, only in the history?
Feb 22 22:36:16 <UndeadLeech>	No, anywhere.
Feb 22 22:36:39 <UndeadLeech>	Just gotta search for anything where the beginning matches, but the end doesn't.
Feb 22 22:37:02 <nixpulvis>	hmmm, not happening for me.
Feb 22 22:37:16 <UndeadLeech>	You sure you're on the latest version?
Feb 22 22:37:33 <nixpulvis>	yes?
Feb 22 22:37:53 <nixpulvis>	369c927d
Feb 22 22:38:09 <UndeadLeech>	Try searching through output of like `ls -lah`.
Feb 22 22:38:18 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think it works on the first line or something odd like that.
Feb 22 22:42:15 <nixpulvis>	hmm, nothing.
Feb 22 22:42:32 <UndeadLeech>	But it works when there is a full match, right?
Feb 22 22:42:35 <UndeadLeech>	You don't have that disabled?
Feb 22 22:50:38 <UndeadLeech>	nixpulvis: Any suspicions at all what might cause the search crash? 
Feb 22 22:50:56 <nixpulvis>	yea, the selection sticks around with a match.
Feb 22 22:51:10 <UndeadLeech>	Huh.
Feb 22 22:51:29 <nixpulvis>	Honestly, I have no idea, other than the fact my fingers are moving quickly today, so maybe I'm just hitting a weird key.
Feb 22 22:51:51 <UndeadLeech>	I frequently close windows on macOS because of their stupid fucking butterfly keyboard. :P
Feb 22 22:52:05 <nixpulvis>	don't get me started.
Feb 22 22:52:08 <UndeadLeech>	:D
Feb 22 22:52:24 <UndeadLeech>	I mean you have files in /tmp though, right?
Feb 22 22:52:27 <UndeadLeech>	That indicates a crash.
Feb 22 22:52:37 <UndeadLeech>	Because the log files will only persist if there was a crash.
Feb 22 22:55:49 <UndeadLeech>	If this is something you run into frequently, I'd really appreciate it if you could maybe redirect Alacritty's stderr somewhere.
Feb 22 23:04:53 <nixpulvis>	yea, let me reconfigure my launcher to do that so I can capture this next time it happens.

Feb 25 20:37:28 <UndeadLeech>	Also nixpulvis, I've got some news you'll probably love. I'm not sure I can make keybindings in the hints section override the default bindings the same way bindings in the key_bindings section do.
Feb 25 20:58:41 <kchibisov>	Oh, firefox is now having the proper refresh rates on pages on Wayland.
Feb 25 21:01:30 <kchibisov>	And we have 'only' 175 deps now on Linux.
Feb 25 21:05:23 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, unfortunately back to duplicates though.
Feb 25 21:05:36 <UndeadLeech>	I've made sure 0.7.2 still stays clean, but 0.8.0 will introduce a couple again.
Feb 25 21:17:05 <nixpulvis>	UndeadLeech: oh god.
Feb 25 21:18:30 <UndeadLeech>	It's problematic, because we don't know anymore what the default bindings are after we've loaded our custom bindings.
Feb 25 21:18:39 <UndeadLeech>	So when adding the hint bindings, we can't just filter them out the same way.
Feb 25 21:19:02 <UndeadLeech>	So in theory to override a default binding with a hint, you'd have to add a key_binding without an action and then add a hint binding.
Feb 25 21:19:12 <UndeadLeech>	I don't know if there's a proper solution to this.
Feb 25 21:19:23 <UndeadLeech>	But that's basically the biggest drawback I'm currently aware of.
Feb 25 21:20:53 <UndeadLeech>	Though I think I may have found a solution that allows us to keep the old input.rs code. Because by using an Rc<Cell<Regex>> we can clone things properly with keeping only a single internally mutable referenc around.
Feb 25 21:21:28 <UndeadLeech>	Because the macro is an absolute mess.

Mar 10 07:45:26 <hendry>	weird, alacritty can't find my xos4 Terminus font anymore
Mar 10 07:46:50 <rcf>	hendry: can you still locate it by name with fc-match 
Mar 10 07:47:04 <rcf>	crossfont didn’t get updated recently I don’t think
Mar 10 07:51:07 <hendry>	fc-match terminus only returns ter-u12n.otb: "Terminus" "Regular" which feels curious
Mar 10 07:55:33 <rcf>	That is the reason, then.
Mar 10 07:55:53 <rcf>	Find it in fc-list
Mar 10 07:56:02 <rcf>	The name may have changed with an update

Mar 18 13:02:36 <nixpulvis>	Is it just me or is zsh's defaults with EDITOR=vim actually broken?
Mar 18 13:03:52 <UndeadLeech>	Hm?
Mar 18 13:04:16 <nixpulvis>	I suppose I might just not understand what the DEL key should be doing... but it's not alacritty's fault at least.
Mar 18 13:04:37 <UndeadLeech>	Del in zsh you mean?
Mar 18 13:04:42 <UndeadLeech>	What does that have to do with EDITOR=vim?
Mar 18 13:05:18 <nixpulvis>	Apperently when EDITOR=vim zsh defaults to vim stuff
Mar 18 13:05:55 <nixpulvis>	like it has a whole insert/normal mode implementation.
Mar 18 13:07:04 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, I think I know what you might mean.
Mar 18 13:07:13 <UndeadLeech>	Also you can set that independently from your EDITOR.
Mar 18 13:08:08 <nixpulvis>	Right, it was just very strange for me trying to play with zsh for the first time in a few years.
Mar 18 13:08:29 <UndeadLeech>	Do you mean that you can't go past the last insert point with backspace when you enter/leave vi mode?
Mar 18 13:12:35 <nixpulvis>	I mean that the DEL key (not BS) is doing some capitalization and movement, and I don't know why.
Mar 18 13:12:52 <UndeadLeech>	It shouldn't.
Mar 18 13:13:00 <UndeadLeech>	Oh.
Mar 18 13:13:04 <UndeadLeech>	Do this: bindkey "${terminfo[kdch1]}" delete-char
Mar 18 13:13:34 <UndeadLeech>	Obviously you don't need to look it up through terminfo. But can't hurt.
Mar 18 13:16:25 <nixpulvis>	zsh: command not found: terminfo
Mar 18 13:16:40 <UndeadLeech>	That's whack.
Mar 18 13:16:47 <UndeadLeech>	Just replace it I suppose.
Mar 18 13:16:54 <nixpulvis>	No manual entry for bindkey
Mar 18 13:16:57 <nixpulvis>	oh dear
Mar 18 13:16:58 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, do this in your zshrc.
Mar 18 13:17:02 <rcf>	I always just assumed it to be ‘really barebones ancient vi mode’ rather than vim mode.
Mar 18 13:17:05 <nixpulvis>	OH
Mar 18 13:17:09 <UndeadLeech>	It's a built-in, those don't usually have manpages.
Mar 18 13:17:29 <UndeadLeech>	rcf: Kinda, but you can do a lot.
Mar 18 13:17:44 <UndeadLeech>	I have `ci"` working for example, which I use a lot with grep.
Mar 18 13:17:54 <nixpulvis>	rcf: yea same, which is kinda why I find it strange that it assumes EDITOR=vim is going to make me want all these arcane bindings.
Mar 18 13:18:07 <rcf>	At which point I just decided ‘x ought to be good enough for anybody’
Mar 18 13:19:06 <nixpulvis>	Nope, that binding didn't change the vi-mode behavior of zsh.
Mar 18 13:19:36 <UndeadLeech>	These are all my bindings: https://github.com/chrisduerr/dotfiles/blob/master/files/zsh/keys.zsh
Mar 18 13:19:50 <UndeadLeech>	It's probably this what you need: https://github.com/chrisduerr/dotfiles/blob/master/files/zsh/keys.zsh#L13
Mar 18 13:20:18 <rcf>	In reality it’s punishing you for setting EDITOR instead of VISUAL, given that the former is reserved for ed on a Real UNIX System
Mar 18 13:22:13 <nixpulvis>	>.<
Mar 18 13:23:04 <nixpulvis>	hmmm, nope. Still capitalizing shit with DEL in vi-mode.
Mar 18 13:23:18 <UndeadLeech>	Probably your fault.
Mar 18 13:24:05 <nixpulvis>	probably.
Mar 18 13:24:11 <nixpulvis>	back to fish I swim
Mar 18 13:24:20 <UndeadLeech>	lmao
Mar 18 13:24:33 <UndeadLeech>	Do you use an empty config?
Mar 18 13:24:39 <UndeadLeech>	Like no omz?
Mar 18 13:24:53 <UndeadLeech>	Also at that point, why don't you just deactivate vi mode bindings?
Mar 18 13:24:57 <nixpulvis>	I really dislike complex shell configurations.
Mar 18 13:25:25 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, god forbid tweaking a tool you use for hours on a daily basis to be actually efficient.
Mar 18 13:25:27 <nixpulvis>	Yea, disabling the vi-mode thing would be the way to go next time I try to switch to zsh...
Mar 18 13:25:50 <UndeadLeech>	Also quite ironic that you use fish when you dislike complex shell configurations. That's basically just what fish is lol.
Mar 18 13:25:59 <nixpulvis>	I was just offended by this strangeness, and assumed my life would become worse if I continued on that path.
Mar 18 13:26:14 <nixpulvis>	Yea... the irony isn't lost on me.
Mar 18 13:26:27 <UndeadLeech>	And your instinct is to abandon ship, rather than investigate and learn?
Mar 18 13:26:59 <nixpulvis>	Well... in this case I can't even imagine a sane reason for this.
Mar 18 13:27:27 <nixpulvis>	So I'm just avoiding learning more archaic nonesense.
Mar 18 13:27:33 <UndeadLeech>	Based on my experience, most people really don't know how default vi behaves.
Mar 18 13:27:40 <UndeadLeech>	They're just used to simple vim.
Mar 18 13:27:58 <nixpulvis>	I didn't set EDITOR=vi now did I?
Mar 18 13:28:12 <rcf>	To be completely fair having seen what some people do with their zsh configs (including omz) fish is a very sane, rational approach. 
Mar 18 13:28:32 <UndeadLeech>	Well vi is the standard. That's what you get when you are on some random minimal VPS.
Mar 18 13:28:37 <nixpulvis>	Fish's only real problem is that it reinvented the shell grammar.
Mar 18 13:28:57 <UndeadLeech>	Fish is just garbage in pretty much every way.
Mar 18 13:29:03 <UndeadLeech>	Noobtrap.
Mar 18 13:29:15 <nixpulvis>	doubtful
Mar 18 13:29:22 <UndeadLeech>	I hate things that hold people back from learning more stuff for the sole purpose of being easy to get into.
Mar 18 13:29:26 <nixpulvis>	the history thing was what sold me on it.
Mar 18 13:29:46 <rcf>	The shell grammar is what causes the brain damage that convinces people the Bourne shell heritage is worth upholding.
Mar 18 13:30:18 <nixpulvis>	So what we should all compile ELFs?
Mar 18 13:30:52 <nixpulvis>	actually... it's fine, just put interpretors in the PATH.
Mar 18 13:31:35 <rcf>	No, but a more sensible syntax not developed by someone who was convinced that the C preprocessor was an ideal ALGOL compiler isn't an absurd proposition. 
Mar 18 13:31:43 <nixpulvis>	Still... I have to deal with so many legacy codes, knowing SH-like grammar is useful.
Mar 18 13:31:59 <rcf>	And I say all this as someone who insists on strict POSIX sh compliance for shell scripts. 
Mar 18 13:32:15 <UndeadLeech>	Honestly modern approaches to "more sensible syntax" are the worst examples of shell syntax I've ever seen.
Mar 18 13:32:39 <nixpulvis>	I'll mostly agree with that.
Mar 18 13:32:48 <nixpulvis>	I miss having $? in fish.
Mar 18 13:33:03 <nixpulvis>	but the if fi thing is dumb.
Mar 18 13:33:03 <UndeadLeech>	Stuff like powershell is straight up hostile to interactive use.
Mar 18 13:33:05 <rcf>	In the end I dislike most of them as well. 
Mar 18 13:33:15 <rcf>	So I stay with zsh. 
Mar 18 13:34:09 <nixpulvis>	I'm trying to remember... I think fish's looping constructs are actually nicer to use.
Mar 18 13:34:24 <UndeadLeech>	Interactively?
Mar 18 13:34:32 <nixpulvis>	In general.
Mar 18 13:34:48 <rcf>	But when someone *likes* fish, and does everything in their power to make zsh behave like fish, mostly via cargo-cult copy-paste zshrc or the use of a monstrosity like ohmyzsh... maybe the real thing isn't a bad idea is all I'm saying. 
Mar 18 13:35:06 <UndeadLeech>	The if/fi syntax really isn't that unreasonable. Though I personally prefer the more ML style brackets of course.
Mar 18 13:35:42 <UndeadLeech>	rcf: I'd say it depends, it might allow people to learn new things and grow.
Mar 18 13:35:57 <UndeadLeech>	A zsh config gimped into some fish mess can eventually slowly transition into something more sensible.
Mar 18 13:36:04 <UndeadLeech>	If you just stick to fish, that's never gonna happen.
Mar 18 13:36:10 <UndeadLeech>	I originally started with omz.
Mar 18 13:36:26 <nixpulvis>	oh my!
Mar 18 13:36:52 <nixpulvis>	At least fish isn't written in javascript.
Mar 18 13:37:10 <nixpulvis>	OK, time to fuel up on hateraid. bbl
Mar 18 13:37:32 <UndeadLeech>	You're telling my your ideal architecture isn't javascript all the way to the kernel?

Mar 23 18:48:23 <nixpulvis>	Instead of the build.rs you mean?
Mar 23 18:48:39 <nixpulvis>	I was kinda wondering if any of these was even really needed.
Mar 23 18:48:43 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah the original code from me was just completely ridiculous.
Mar 23 18:48:50 <UndeadLeech>	Adapting it in any way is not sensible.
Mar 23 18:50:57 <nixpulvis>	So convering, for example, 31 to "31" then appending it should be fast enough you think?
Mar 23 18:51:37 <UndeadLeech>	Here's the thing: I relied on such an extreme implementation to verify if it would be possible to do this in a blocking matter at all without completely killing performance.
Mar 23 18:51:46 <UndeadLeech>	I came to the conclusion that it isn't, at least not on a single thread.
Mar 23 18:52:01 <UndeadLeech>	Thus it doesn't really matter how fast it is, because it's not fast enough.
Mar 23 18:52:23 <nixpulvis>	Good, that's helping me understand.
Mar 23 18:52:32 <nixpulvis>	I was really confused by this at first...
Mar 23 18:52:47 <nixpulvis>	Which is basically why I stopped thinking about the fancy macro :P
Mar 23 18:52:58 <UndeadLeech>	The performance difference is relatively minor in practice. But it was the fastest implementation I have found.
Mar 23 18:53:29 <nixpulvis>	I mean yea... binary -> ascii numbers is kinda a pain I guess.
Mar 23 18:54:00 <UndeadLeech>	I've also had a much simpler and still pretty fast implementation just doing it digit by digit.
Mar 23 18:54:26 <nixpulvis>	Yea, that makes sense.
Mar 23 18:54:26 <UndeadLeech>	It's not that complicated really, the question is just what your constraints are.
Mar 23 18:54:42 <nixpulvis>	I was honestly surprised I didn't see that in the STD.
Mar 23 18:54:42 <UndeadLeech>	Having a limited set of numbers makes things easier to optimize for your specific case.
Mar 23 18:54:52 <UndeadLeech>	It is in STD.
Mar 23 18:54:57 <UndeadLeech>	ToString.
Mar 23 18:55:11 <UndeadLeech>	The Display impl.
Mar 23 18:58:12 <nixpulvis>	lol... oh yea

Mar 24 14:56:23 <ScottHDev5>	Hello, do you know how alacritty could know when the user changes directory in the spawned shell ?
Mar 24 14:57:53 <avih>	i don't think it knows/cares. why?
Mar 24 14:58:42 <avih>	it's a different process. i don't think the terminal should track its current working directory
Mar 24 14:59:43 <avih>	ScottHDev5: when is that relevant?
Mar 24 15:12:25 <ScottHDev5>	I'm trying to make tabbed spawn a new alacritty terminal in the same directory as the previous one
Mar 24 15:13:12 <ScottHDev5>	I'm gonna use /proc/PID/environ for that

Mar 24 21:53:49 <ScottHDev5>	when I do Ctrl+Shift+Return, it's tabbed which spawns the new alacritty window. That's why it's tabbed which should ask the previous alacritty window where the user shell was in order to spawn the knew one at the same place. If the container doesn't do it, what is going to do it ?
Mar 24 21:54:11 <ScottHDev5>	*new
Mar 24 22:11:07 <rcf>	ScottHDev5: for zsh (what I use) I'd probably go with something along the lines of https://rcf.sdf.org/pb/t/fa3dad20 in my .zshrc to allow for this.
