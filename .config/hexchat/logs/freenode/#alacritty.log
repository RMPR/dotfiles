Nov 07 19:49:27 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: Your bug with modifiers are comming from winit, I guess, since on key release you're setting `lctrl` state to `false`(it's correct), but glutin mods says it's `true`.
Nov 07 19:51:07 <kchibisov>	On press glutin ctrl is set to false though
Nov 07 20:18:19 <kchibisov>	btw https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1262 fixes this bug on X11.
Nov 07 20:54:29 <kchibisov>	And on Wayland we need ModifiersChanged event, since on ctrl release, glutin's ctrl modifier is still `true`.

Jan 02 13:53:48 <alex``>	how to override settings via cli?
Jan 02 13:54:07 <alex``>	I want to set the background opacity
Jan 02 13:54:11 <UndeadLeech>	alex``: You cannot override all configuration options via cli.
Jan 02 13:54:22 <alex``>	:(
Jan 02 13:54:35 <kchibisov>	If UndeadLeech is fine with me adding flag for opacity I can send a PR
Jan 02 13:54:38 <kchibisov>	since I also need it.
Jan 02 13:54:39 <UndeadLeech>	It's been discussed before, but it's not really high priority enough.
Jan 02 13:54:46 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: I don't think I am.
Jan 02 13:55:02 <kchibisov>	Ofc, because you don't use it.
Jan 02 13:55:04 <alex``>	currently I have a horrible hack to use a temporary file
Jan 02 13:55:05 <UndeadLeech>	If we change this, I'd like a way to just set all configuration options.
Jan 02 13:55:07 *	kchibisov is joking
Jan 02 13:55:11 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Jan 02 13:55:39 <UndeadLeech>	The problem is just that I'm not aware of any nice way to implement this, but I haven't looked much into it yet.
Jan 02 13:55:46 <alex``>	https://gist.github.com/f3e7e12c7357737cdb3234637bf5f422
Jan 02 13:56:02 <alex``>	horrible horrible :(
Jan 02 13:56:10 <UndeadLeech>	Would want something like `alacritty --option scrolling.history 100000 --option background_opacity 0`.
Jan 02 13:56:10 <kchibisov>	alex``: you can patch your alacritty tbh, it's not that hard.
Jan 02 13:56:23 <alex``>	how?
Jan 02 13:56:45 <kchibisov>	I mean you can add a flag to alacritty yourself, it's not that hard tbh.
Jan 02 13:56:57 <alex``>	ah
Jan 02 13:57:02 <alex``>	UndeadLeech: yes
Jan 02 14:00:22 <kchibisov>	Oh, I have an odd idea. Could you build a valid yaml from this thing UndeadLeech ?
Jan 02 14:01:03 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think `key.key.key` is valid in yaml.
Jan 02 14:01:03 <kchibisov>	not exactly yaml, but translate such option to our config and then merge configs.
Jan 02 14:01:45 <UndeadLeech>	It's a good idea, though we might have to build a tool ourselves to convert it.
Jan 02 14:02:11 <kchibisov>	I mean we should have a way to write it once and not touch afterwards. Like you shouldn't tune it each time you add new option to config.
Jan 02 14:02:37 <UndeadLeech>	Yes, exactly. Everything else wouldn't be acceptable.
Jan 02 14:03:30 <alex``>	jq have a similar syntax
Jan 02 14:03:35 <alex``>	has*
Jan 02 14:03:35 <kchibisov>	maybe we can use `scrolling.history: 10000` and then just translate dots into new lines
Jan 02 14:03:53 <UndeadLeech>	Newlines and indentation! Careful there. :D
Jan 02 14:03:54 <kchibisov>	I mean colon + new line.
Jan 02 14:04:07 <kchibisov>	and indention...
Jan 02 14:04:33 <UndeadLeech>	I mean at that point we might as well have it as separate parameters too.
Jan 02 14:04:40 <UndeadLeech>	I think that would be the unix way.
Jan 02 14:04:47 <alex``>	https://github.com/alexherbo2/krabby/commit/d625bb662901560e311c8a3227d1ce13ed7fb92f#diff-171b240ba817349df923fe7acebbe72dR5
Jan 02 14:04:48 <kchibisov>	unix way...
Jan 02 14:04:58 <UndeadLeech>	If we need to transform it anyways, it doesn't really make things much more complicated.
Jan 02 14:05:00 <alex``>	> jq '.browser_specific_settings.gecko.id = "krabby@mozilla.org"' manifest.json > target/firefox/manifest.json
Jan 02 14:05:14 <alex``>	pretty convenient syntax
Jan 02 14:05:45 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, I didn't come up with this. Neither did `jq`. It's a pretty common format and I believe other terminals work similarly.
Jan 02 14:06:29 <alex``>	is jwilm still on the project?
Jan 02 14:06:56 <UndeadLeech>	Currently he's busy with other things unrelated to Alacritty.
Jan 02 14:06:57 <alex``>	it looks he have abandonned the development Alacritty
Jan 02 14:07:11 <kchibisov>	Well our development is quite active as you can see.

Jan 02 17:24:06 <Levanx>	(This pretty clearly should be the repo image for alacritty imho :D)
Jan 02 17:24:49 <kchibisov>	Levanx: true, I already tried to convince UndeadLeech to change a picture to something more fun.
Jan 02 17:25:29 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: You're not the first one to say that.
Jan 02 17:25:44 <UndeadLeech>	Though last time it was a big thinking emoji. :P
Jan 02 17:26:09 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: So currently we only scale it, if it has color? In retrospect, that very clearly seems wrong.
Jan 02 17:26:17 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:26:36 <UndeadLeech>	And you're saying it's only possible to make these emojis monochrome in Alacritty? Not in fontconfig?
Jan 02 17:26:52 <UndeadLeech>	Sounds strange.
Jan 02 17:26:59 <kchibisov>	Yeah, I wasn't able to make them monochrome in fontconfig
Jan 02 17:27:28 <UndeadLeech>	Huh.
Jan 02 17:27:38 <kchibisov>	Our handling seems fine tbh.
Jan 02 17:27:39 <UndeadLeech>	Well, proper monochrome emoji fonts are going to look better anyways I suppose.
Jan 02 17:28:05 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean it seems fine? How is color a good way to determine if a glyph needs to be scaled?
Jan 02 17:28:06 <kchibisov>	`let color = pat.color().next().unwrap_or(false);`
Jan 02 17:28:15 <kchibisov>	no, I'm about fontconfig check
Jan 02 17:28:27 <UndeadLeech>	You mean the embedded bitmap crash?
Jan 02 17:28:32 <kchibisov>	No color check
Jan 02 17:28:48 <kchibisov>	I mean I should be able to disable the thing
Jan 02 17:29:04 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, you mean that you should be able to set it from fontconfig, gotcha.
Jan 02 17:29:07 <kchibisov>	it's even default to false.
Jan 02 17:29:59 <kchibisov>	Well we can't strip an alpha channel from this non colored emojis
Jan 02 17:30:13 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Jan 02 17:30:25 <kchibisov>	I mean they do have alpha.
Jan 02 17:30:41 <UndeadLeech>	How is that a problem?
Jan 02 17:31:21 <kchibisov>	I mean do you want to color them with escape or not afterwards?
Jan 02 17:32:00 <UndeadLeech>	Ouh that's a really good question.
Jan 02 17:32:14 <UndeadLeech>	You mean since they come in a BGRA buffer, we'd basically handle them like colored emojis?
Jan 02 17:32:19 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:32:31 <kchibisov>	I mean their pixels are RGBA
Jan 02 17:32:37 <kchibisov>	so it's a colored thing for our renderer
Jan 02 17:32:39 <UndeadLeech>	Does that happen with them right now already?
Jan 02 17:32:47 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:32:53 <UndeadLeech>	I'd just keep it that way, but scale them tbh.
Jan 02 17:33:08 <UndeadLeech>	I doubt anyone would use them, but if they do, we at least don't have them massive.
Jan 02 17:33:13 <kchibisov>	Well, it seems like they're being colored properly tbh
Jan 02 17:33:27 <UndeadLeech>	But BGRA aren't colored, right?
Jan 02 17:33:31 <UndeadLeech>	RGBA*
Jan 02 17:33:39 <UndeadLeech>	We use that to determine color, aren't we?
Jan 02 17:33:45 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:34:03 <kchibisov>	I feel like there's something odd with this thing.
Jan 02 17:34:09 <kchibisov>	like I don't understand it.
Jan 02 17:34:22 <UndeadLeech>	I mean in theory converting to alpha mask should be trivial, but it's work that probably is never going to pay off.
Jan 02 17:34:25 <kchibisov>	we're setting #ffffff color for them, but you can still color it.
Jan 02 17:34:37 <UndeadLeech>	It seems very odd then, yeah.
Jan 02 17:34:46 <UndeadLeech>	With a black background?
Jan 02 17:34:50 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:35:25 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's the only place where we pass color to the renderer. So it should be impossible.
Jan 02 17:35:34 <kchibisov>	magic.
Jan 02 17:35:43 <kchibisov>	wait.
Jan 02 17:35:45 <UndeadLeech>	That's what it sounds like. Unless it's not an RGBA buffer.
Jan 02 17:35:55 *	UndeadLeech waits.
Jan 02 17:40:01 <kchibisov>	It's not BGRA...
Jan 02 17:40:27 <kchibisov>	It's GRAY.
Jan 02 17:42:51 <kchibisov>	Ehm, now it's interesting, we should downscale gray thing.
Jan 02 17:49:46 <kchibisov>	What do you thing about downsampling everything with fixupfactor less then a 1?
Jan 02 17:49:51 <kchibisov>	s/thing/think
Jan 02 19:51:05 <UndeadLeech>	I'd have to check how we compute the fixup factor again. Is that computed at all?
Jan 02 19:51:22 <UndeadLeech>	Will fonts always provide it, even if it's a 'normal' glyph?
Jan 02 21:41:23 <UndeadLeech>	I think I just fixed the last bug of the 0.4.1 milestone, now we wait for winit/glutin.
Jan 02 22:42:34 <cole-h>	🎉

Mar 18 17:20:15 <nixpulvis>	https://crates.io/users/swmon
Mar 18 17:20:18 <nixpulvis>	look at this shit.
Mar 18 17:20:44 <nixpulvis>	9 fucking pages of crates, not 1 LoC as far as I can tell.
Mar 18 17:21:10 <nixpulvis>	sorry 11 pages.
Mar 18 17:22:03 <nixpulvis>	on the *bright* side ;) https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/3423#issuecomment-600726351 looks pretty.

Mar 18 17:36:17 <UndeadLeech>	It should have just made it more robust.

Mar 18 17:39:33 <kchibisov>	it sending char twice, yes
Mar 18 17:39:40 <kchibisov>	but only in Alt screen.
Mar 18 17:40:11 <UndeadLeech>	Huh?
Mar 18 17:41:30 <UndeadLeech>	Ah, I don't think it's alt screen.
Mar 18 17:42:08 <kchibisov>	I'm just saying that outside of neovim it works(1 char), inside it sends 2 chars.
Mar 18 17:43:00 <UndeadLeech>	echo -e "\e[?1h"
Mar 18 17:43:02 <UndeadLeech>	And it'll break.
Mar 18 17:44:04 <kchibisov>	so, it's just any mode besides normal?
Mar 18 17:44:34 <UndeadLeech>	Might be related to this potentially: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/1a8cd172e520e493bacc9c6a2ae6f80de086eaa3#diff-477049f60a4e0056df655eec516628e7R272
Mar 18 17:45:20 <kchibisov>	it was bisected to vi mode already.
Mar 18 17:45:34 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah I know, that doesn't really help though.
Mar 18 17:46:41 <UndeadLeech>	Ah.
Mar 18 17:46:44 <UndeadLeech>	The notmode doesn't match.
Mar 18 17:46:51 <UndeadLeech>	So it doesn't consider them equal.
Mar 18 17:47:56 <UndeadLeech>	I'm not sure if we can fix that.
Mar 18 17:48:10 <kchibisov>	...

Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Now talking on #alacritty
Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Topic for #alacritty is: Alacritty - A GPU-accelerated terminal emulator <> Latest Release: v0.4.1 - https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/releases/tag/v0.4.1
Mar 18 22:39:12 *	Topic for #alacritty set by UndeadLeech!~UndeadLee@165.227.76.134 (Sun Feb 16 20:20:48 2020)
Mar 18 22:39:15 <kchibisov>	but if your bold font isn't a bold font it doesn't matter.
Mar 18 22:40:25 <kchibisov>	Also, we don't know if your font is bold or not.
Mar 18 22:40:25 <ubitux>	no but i mean, if the terminal can't show to the user the difference between bold and non-bold because the font doesn't support it, wouldn't it make sense to fallback on using the bright color instead by default (if and only if the font doesn't support it)
Mar 18 22:40:30 <ubitux>	but i'm nitpicking about random default, that setting is fine with me
Mar 18 22:40:32 <kchibisov>	we don't know it.
Mar 18 22:40:43 <ubitux>	ah, alright
Mar 18 22:40:55 <ubitux>	no such meta? that's surprising
Mar 18 22:41:13 <kchibisov>	I mean I can use different regular font as a bold font.
Mar 18 22:41:43 <kchibisov>	even if you have some meta, you can't say for sure.
Mar 18 22:41:50 <ubitux>	ok ok
Mar 18 22:42:10 <kchibisov>	So changing draw_bold_text_as_bright is likely a way to go for most users.
Mar 18 22:42:43 <kchibisov>	If they still want this behavior.
Mar 18 22:42:44 <ubitux>	alright
Mar 18 22:43:05 <kchibisov>	However I'd recommend to use bright colors if you want them.
Mar 18 22:44:00 <ubitux>	yeah i re-enabled that setting
Mar 18 22:44:11 <kchibisov>	I mean in your app.
Mar 18 22:44:19 <ubitux>	ah :)
Mar 18 22:46:45 <ubitux>	ok so, that vi-mode, i typically used it to copy a line in urxvt, right now the workflow equivalent of alt+esc <make select> esc shift+insert seems: ctrl+shift+space <make select> i ctrl+shift+v
Mar 18 22:46:58 <ubitux>	is there a way to have the copy inside the native clipboard?
Mar 18 22:47:12 <ubitux>	so i can use shift+insert instead of ctrl+shift+v?
Mar 18 22:47:27 <ubitux>	(and transfer it elsewhere)
Mar 18 22:48:00 <kchibisov>	shift + insert should work.
Mar 18 22:48:19 <kchibisov>	IIRC we have a binding for it to paste.
Mar 18 22:48:25 <UndeadLeech>	As long as you're not on macOS, yes.
Mar 18 22:49:10 <ubitux>	it's not in the clipboard, so shift+insert doesn't work here
Mar 18 22:49:19 <UndeadLeech>	Where else would it be?
Mar 18 22:49:23 <cole-h>	Man, English is hard
Mar 18 22:49:29 <ubitux>	in some alacritty specific buffer
Mar 18 22:49:31 <kchibisov>	Oh, have you pressed `copy`?
Mar 18 22:49:32 <UndeadLeech>	It really is. Especially shortenglish.
Mar 18 22:49:37 <cole-h>	UndeadLeech: Can we switch our changelog to lojban?
Mar 18 22:49:41 <cole-h>	:D
Mar 18 22:49:41 <ubitux>	kchibisov: "y" yes
Mar 18 22:49:52 <UndeadLeech>	As soon as you yank it, it will be in the system clipboard.
Mar 18 22:50:01 <kchibisov>	so ctrl + shift + v works, but shift + insert - not?
Mar 18 22:50:03 <UndeadLeech>	cole-h: Brainfuck.
Mar 18 22:50:06 <ubitux>	kchibisov: yes
Mar 18 22:50:20 <cole-h>	UndeadLeech: I thought that was just a JS dialect
Mar 18 22:50:22 <cole-h>	Oh no
Mar 18 22:50:30 <ubitux>	kchibisov: if i make a mouse select, shift+insert works though
Mar 18 22:50:36 <UndeadLeech>	ubitux: Could you check your `alacritty --print-events` output? Sounds like your key isn't setting the virtual keycode.
Mar 18 22:50:38 <ubitux>	but not after in yank the vi-mode
Mar 18 22:50:40 <UndeadLeech>	cole-h: That's JSFuck.
Mar 18 22:50:45 <ubitux>	a yank in vi-mode*
Mar 18 22:50:53 <kchibisov>	Oh, shift + insert is from primary buffer?
Mar 18 22:51:12 <kchibisov>	I mean from middle mouse selection.
Mar 18 22:51:17 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah.
Mar 18 22:51:23 <UndeadLeech>	Shift+Insert pastes from selection clipboard.
Mar 18 22:51:27 <kchibisov>	Oh, so you should yank to it.
Mar 18 22:51:29 <UndeadLeech>	You can change that though ubitux.
Mar 18 22:51:41 <ubitux>	yeah?
Mar 18 22:51:42 <kchibisov>	`y` is to a Ctrl + V clipboard.
Mar 18 22:52:03 <UndeadLeech>	Just copy the keybinding and change it to `Paste` instead of `PasteSelection`.
Mar 18 22:52:26 <ubitux>	kchibisov: ah i see, that one works indeed
Mar 18 22:52:43 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, the problem is the pasting, not the copying.
Mar 18 22:52:45 <ubitux>	UndeadLeech: it's not the paste i want to change
Mar 18 22:52:51 <kchibisov>	Hm, UndeadLeech do we need a binding to copy to primary buffer?
Mar 18 22:52:56 <ubitux>	UndeadLeech:  no because i want to middle click somewhere else
Mar 18 22:52:59 <UndeadLeech>	Wait, you actually want it to yank to the selection clipboard?
Mar 18 22:53:05 <ubitux>	yep
Mar 18 22:53:09 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: Potentially.
Mar 18 22:53:28 <kchibisov>	ok, we'll add CopyPrimary.
Mar 18 22:53:45 <ubitux>	i mean it's not actually important but it's surprising coming from urxvt
Mar 18 22:53:50 <ubitux>	i sure can adapt :)
Mar 18 22:54:05 <UndeadLeech>	We just follow what vi does when you set it to write to your host clipboard.
Mar 18 22:54:11 <UndeadLeech>	It doesn't write to the selection clipboard either.
Mar 18 22:54:21 <ubitux>	im not sure vi is the best example of clipboard copy/paste :')
Mar 18 22:54:37 <ubitux>	freaking nightmare to get copy/paste correct with vim
Mar 18 22:54:42 <kchibisov>	I mean you have a way to copy into primary buffer from vi, we just forgot about it.
Mar 18 22:55:07 <kchibisov>	The problem I see is that you don't have primary buffer on macOS/Windows.
Mar 18 22:55:26 <kchibisov>	And on some Wayland compositors it's not a thing either.

Mar 19 15:32:44 <kchibisov>	So msi installer could only be for the actuall release. We do provide 'portable', they are enough for testing IIRC.
Mar 19 16:21:41 <nixpulvis>	yo, can you tell LLVM to ignore a single instruction for optimization?
Mar 19 16:38:46 <kchibisov>	put it in asm_volatile?
Mar 19 16:39:05 <nixpulvis>	ohhh nice, volatile may make sense
Mar 19 16:39:25 <kchibisov>	you should use assembly though.
Mar 19 16:39:48 <kchibisov>	however you can pass your value to asm_volatile as input, so LLVM won't touch it.
Mar 19 16:40:06 <kchibisov>	like let x = 0; __asm volatile(x);
Mar 19 16:40:27 <kchibisov>	at least it won't optimize it away.
Mar 19 17:38:06 <ubitux>	mmh, alacritty git/master is much much slower in (n)vim here compared to latest release
Mar 19 17:38:09 <ubitux>	is this known?
Mar 19 17:39:44 <ubitux>	my cpu spikes violently when i scroll (jjjjj...)
Mar 19 17:40:15 <ubitux>	i get one core at 100%
Mar 19 17:41:46 <kchibisov>	what's your `alacritty --version`?
Mar 19 17:43:34 <ubitux>	alacritty 0.5.0-dev (3d7a789)
Mar 19 17:44:34 <kchibisov>	Does it spikes in alacritty or vim?
Mar 19 17:45:25 <ubitux>	alacritty
Mar 19 17:45:29 <kchibisov>	I can't repro either in nvim or on benchmarks.
Mar 19 17:45:45 <kchibisov>	Are you sure that you're using release build?
Mar 19 17:45:58 <kchibisov>	on both X11/Wayland I mean.
Mar 19 17:47:47 <ubitux>	it's a debug build (i did a cargo run)
Mar 19 17:48:01 <ubitux>	how can i enable the release one?
Mar 19 17:48:11 <cole-h>	`cargo run --release`
Mar 19 17:49:47 <kchibisov>	Well, I'm not surprised for debug build.
Mar 19 17:50:11 <kchibisov>	I mean for its performance.
Mar 19 17:52:02 <ubitux>	cole-h: thanks, trying that out (damn it's so slow to compile :P)
Mar 19 17:52:28 <cole-h>	Debug builds are for debugging because they're relatively quick to compile
Mar 19 17:52:35 <cole-h>	Release builds are for day-to-day use :P
Mar 19 17:52:48 <kchibisov>	if you want to install your `release` build later, you should do `cargo install --path alacritty --locked --force`.
Mar 19 17:52:54 <ubitux>	it's stuck on the last bin for 3 minutes already
Mar 19 17:52:59 <cole-h>	Yep
Mar 19 17:53:02 <kchibisov>	yeah, LTO.
Mar 19 17:53:19 *	cole-h can't wait until `--locked` becomes unnecessary, because it should be default...
Mar 19 17:53:25 <ubitux>	ah that's much better indeed
Mar 19 17:53:33 <ubitux>	release doesn't have the problem, nice
Mar 19 17:53:43 <ubitux>	sorry for the noise :)
Mar 19 17:53:49 <kchibisov>	does it differ from your old version?
Mar 19 17:54:07 <kchibisov>	for me it's like 2% in alacritty when I scroll in neovim with 60 repeat rate.
Mar 19 17:54:07 <ubitux>	nah, it's pretty much the same
Mar 19 17:54:26 <ubitux>	yeah it's not really noticable, around 5-10%, but that's nvim
Mar 19 17:54:46 <kchibisov>	So old version is about the same here?
Mar 19 17:57:25 <ubitux>	i tried a larger file, it's actually a bit faster in the old version
Mar 19 17:57:33 <ubitux>	like, 24% vs 27% cpu
Mar 19 17:57:48 <ubitux>	but that's fine with me
Mar 19 17:58:02 <kchibisov>	I mean it's hard to judje since rust changes perf most of the time.
Mar 19 17:58:14 <kchibisov>	Like it really depends on compiler sometimes.
Mar 19 17:58:26 <kchibisov>	On benchmarks I don't see any difference.
Mar 19 18:03:49 <kchibisov>	I also wonder why our CPU usage differs so much in nvim.
Mar 19 18:04:10 <kchibisov>	Oh, are you using integrated GPU?
Mar 19 18:05:15 <ubitux>	yes
Mar 19 18:05:45 <kchibisov>	yeah, so for me all of extra percent is on GPU, I think.
Mar 19 18:05:53 <ubitux>	i have enough ptsd with big brand gpu, and i like small machines :p
Mar 19 18:07:40 <kchibisov>	yeah, was just curious. And they ask why terminal needs GPU acceleration :- ).
Mar 19 18:09:00 <kchibisov>	Though for laptops you don't have much options on Linux and the way to go is integrated GPU, since NVIDIA is NVIDIA, and AMD GPU in a laptops is still very rare thing.
Mar 19 18:09:36 <kchibisov>	Dedicated AMD GPU in a laptop, I mean.
Mar 19 18:15:52 <nixpulvis>	My nvidia card is starting to act up, and I'm worried :(
Mar 19 18:16:37 <kchibisov>	take a screw driver and remove it.
Mar 19 18:17:26 <kchibisov>	Anyway it's pretty useless for Linux desktops.
Mar 19 18:17:29 <nixpulvis>	but then how will my computer conntect to my monitors?
Mar 19 18:18:02 <kchibisov>	Don't you have integrated GPU inside of it?
Mar 19 18:18:40 <kchibisov>	unless it's some gaming Windows PC, it should work fine.
Mar 19 18:18:58 *	nixpulvis is a gamer
Mar 19 18:19:05 <nixpulvis>	don't judge me
Mar 19 18:19:31 <nixpulvis>	at least I'm not a bitcoin miner.
Mar 19 18:19:50 <kchibisov>	You can game on Linux just fine most of the time though.
Mar 19 18:19:56 <nixpulvis>	false
Mar 19 18:20:17 <kchibisov>	With AMD GPU it should work just fnie.
Mar 19 18:20:21 <kchibisov>	with nvidia - no.
Mar 19 18:20:48 <nixpulvis>	last time I tried to play WoW (not currently active) on Linux, it was a mess.
Mar 19 18:21:01 <kchibisov>	lutris + dxvk?
Mar 19 18:21:22 <kchibisov>	just click, click, and click play.
Mar 19 18:21:32 <nixpulvis>	hmmmm, nope. Maybe that'll do a better job
Mar 19 18:22:01 <kchibisov>	you need Vulkan though.
Mar 19 18:22:22 <kchibisov>	not sure whether NVIDIA supports it on Linux in their binary blob driver.
Mar 19 18:22:27 <nixpulvis>	sure
Mar 19 18:22:41 <nixpulvis>	they state that they do...
Mar 19 18:22:44 <nixpulvis>	but...
Mar 19 18:22:54 <nixpulvis>	1.1 anyway.
Mar 19 18:26:33 <cole-h>	Doesn't help that Blizzard is/was actively hostile to its Linux users lol

Mar 20 12:25:51 <danyspin97>	i am trying right now the Focus hook in kakoune and it doesn't receive the event
Mar 20 12:26:10 <kchibisov>	but HollowCursor works?
Mar 20 12:26:22 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:26:24 <danyspin97>	"[2020-03-20 12:24:01.679761863] [INFO] glutin event: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(Wayland(WindowId(94589361942368))), event: Focused(false) }"
Mar 20 12:26:38 <kchibisov>	so so focus events are working.
Mar 20 12:27:03 <danyspin97>	but the client (kakoune) isn't receiving them
Mar 20 12:27:18 <kchibisov>	why they should receive it?
Mar 20 12:28:18 <danyspin97>	windows get updated based on the focus
Mar 20 12:28:43 <kchibisov>	Hm, so there should be espca, etc.
Mar 20 12:28:48 <danyspin97>	i.e. there is tagbar window that updates its contents based on which window is focused
Mar 20 12:29:43 <danyspin97>	what do you mean by "espca"
Mar 20 12:29:53 <kchibisov>	Could you provide me `alacritty -vvv` output?
Mar 20 12:30:00 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:30:01 <kchibisov>	during repro ofc.
Mar 20 12:33:06 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKy
Mar 20 12:34:16 <kchibisov>	Oh, could you also include `--print-events` to it?
Mar 20 12:34:20 <danyspin97>	yea
Mar 20 12:36:05 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKA
Mar 20 12:36:50 <kchibisov>	Could you provide the same output from v0.4.1?
Mar 20 12:37:06 <kchibisov>	For now it seems like your editor bug.
Mar 20 12:37:52 <danyspin97>	I cannot compile prior to 0.4.1-rc1 :/
Mar 20 12:38:06 <kchibisov>	how so?
Mar 20 12:38:20 <kchibisov>	Ah, you don't have x11.
Mar 20 12:38:24 <danyspin97>	I needed the x11/wayland features patch
Mar 20 12:38:34 <kchibisov>	you can patch v0.4.1.
Mar 20 12:38:46 <kchibisov>	just apply this patch on v0.4.1, it should work.
Mar 20 12:42:52 <kchibisov>	If you have any issue applying the patch let me know.
Mar 20 12:44:28 <danyspin97>	in the end I'm compiling xcb, I'll remove it later
Mar 20 12:45:01 <kchibisov>	it should be applied just fine.
Mar 20 12:45:26 <kchibisov>	like I don't see why it should fail?
Mar 20 12:46:42 <kchibisov>	yeah, the last time we've touched related file were on v0.4.0.
Mar 20 12:47:06 <danyspin97>	i don't see the patch :/
Mar 20 12:47:08 <kchibisov>	so you can safely apply 4000ec04d89b9bd77995960d2a9da8fcad55e003 to v0.4.1.
Mar 20 12:47:50 <danyspin97>	but anyway, I've recompiled alacritty from source, v0.4.1
Mar 20 12:48:14 <kchibisov>	nice, I need the same output.
Mar 20 12:50:26 <danyspin97>	http://ix.io/2eKF
Mar 20 12:52:57 <kchibisov>	I'll assume it works on it?
Mar 20 12:53:11 <danyspin97>	it doesn't
Mar 20 12:53:20 <kchibisov>	lul
Mar 20 12:53:54 <kchibisov>	So when did it work last time?
Mar 20 12:54:26 <kchibisov>	this patch could be applied even on v0.4.0, just saying.
Mar 20 12:54:44 <danyspin97>	I don't know, it is the first time I check this hook :/
Mar 20 12:55:13 <kchibisov>	the problem is that it unsets the mode.
Mar 20 12:55:19 <kchibisov>	as you can see in a log.
Mar 20 12:55:26 <kchibisov>	Like it sets it and then unsets it.
Mar 20 12:57:22 <kchibisov>	Are you sure that it works at all and it's not an editor bug?
Mar 20 12:58:28 <danyspin97>	I was talking in #kakoune before and they said me it had to be on alacritty end :/ I can try on x11 on another system and check
Mar 20 12:58:53 <kchibisov>	this is not a problem in wayland, etc.
Mar 20 12:59:06 <kchibisov>	The problem that your editor resets mode.
Mar 20 12:59:12 <kchibisov>	so it sets mode and then resets.
Mar 20 12:59:22 <danyspin97>	alacritty receive the "focused" event so I guess that is not related to sway
Mar 20 12:59:41 <kchibisov>	As I said, the problem is on a different level.
Mar 20 12:59:49 <danyspin97>	give me 5 minutes and I try it on x11
Mar 20 12:59:49 <kchibisov>	it's not gui related, etc.
Mar 20 12:59:53 <kchibisov>	don't do that.
Mar 20 12:59:57 <kchibisov>	it's just a waste of time.
Mar 20 13:00:10 <danyspin97>	hmm okay
Mar 20 13:00:50 <kchibisov>	The problem in escape sequences from your editor.
Mar 20 13:01:09 <danyspin97>	Ah
Mar 20 13:01:41 <kchibisov>	So it send escape to enable Focus hook, and then disable it.
Mar 20 13:02:02 <kchibisov>	Read the log for ReportFocusInOut
Mar 20 13:02:58 <kchibisov>	So they are sending reset of this mode right away after setting it for whatever reason.
Mar 20 13:03:34 <kchibisov>	try echo -e "\e[?1004h", then `cat` and try to refocus.
Mar 20 13:03:45 <kchibisov>	you'll see this hook getting triggered.
Mar 20 13:06:23 <danyspin97>	I see
Mar 20 13:07:40 <kchibisov>	were you talking to them now?
Mar 20 13:07:49 <kchibisov>	your editor folks?
Mar 20 13:07:50 <danyspin97>	https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/6766297623e9718db5b2b09bd655fe183acdcf67/src/ncurses_ui.cc#L1256
Mar 20 13:07:56 <danyspin97>	may this be related?
Mar 20 13:08:16 <kchibisov>	we have sgr mouse support.
