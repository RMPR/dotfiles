Nov 07 19:49:27 <kchibisov>	UndeadLeech: Your bug with modifiers are comming from winit, I guess, since on key release you're setting `lctrl` state to `false`(it's correct), but glutin mods says it's `true`.
Nov 07 19:51:07 <kchibisov>	On press glutin ctrl is set to false though
Nov 07 20:18:19 <kchibisov>	btw https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/1262 fixes this bug on X11.
Nov 07 20:54:29 <kchibisov>	And on Wayland we need ModifiersChanged event, since on ctrl release, glutin's ctrl modifier is still `true`.

Jan 02 13:53:48 <alex``>	how to override settings via cli?
Jan 02 13:54:07 <alex``>	I want to set the background opacity
Jan 02 13:54:11 <UndeadLeech>	alex``: You cannot override all configuration options via cli.
Jan 02 13:54:22 <alex``>	:(
Jan 02 13:54:35 <kchibisov>	If UndeadLeech is fine with me adding flag for opacity I can send a PR
Jan 02 13:54:38 <kchibisov>	since I also need it.
Jan 02 13:54:39 <UndeadLeech>	It's been discussed before, but it's not really high priority enough.
Jan 02 13:54:46 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: I don't think I am.
Jan 02 13:55:02 <kchibisov>	Ofc, because you don't use it.
Jan 02 13:55:04 <alex``>	currently I have a horrible hack to use a temporary file
Jan 02 13:55:05 <UndeadLeech>	If we change this, I'd like a way to just set all configuration options.
Jan 02 13:55:07 *	kchibisov is joking
Jan 02 13:55:11 <UndeadLeech>	:)
Jan 02 13:55:39 <UndeadLeech>	The problem is just that I'm not aware of any nice way to implement this, but I haven't looked much into it yet.
Jan 02 13:55:46 <alex``>	https://gist.github.com/f3e7e12c7357737cdb3234637bf5f422
Jan 02 13:56:02 <alex``>	horrible horrible :(
Jan 02 13:56:10 <UndeadLeech>	Would want something like `alacritty --option scrolling.history 100000 --option background_opacity 0`.
Jan 02 13:56:10 <kchibisov>	alex``: you can patch your alacritty tbh, it's not that hard.
Jan 02 13:56:23 <alex``>	how?
Jan 02 13:56:45 <kchibisov>	I mean you can add a flag to alacritty yourself, it's not that hard tbh.
Jan 02 13:56:57 <alex``>	ah
Jan 02 13:57:02 <alex``>	UndeadLeech: yes
Jan 02 14:00:22 <kchibisov>	Oh, I have an odd idea. Could you build a valid yaml from this thing UndeadLeech ?
Jan 02 14:01:03 <UndeadLeech>	I don't think `key.key.key` is valid in yaml.
Jan 02 14:01:03 <kchibisov>	not exactly yaml, but translate such option to our config and then merge configs.
Jan 02 14:01:45 <UndeadLeech>	It's a good idea, though we might have to build a tool ourselves to convert it.
Jan 02 14:02:11 <kchibisov>	I mean we should have a way to write it once and not touch afterwards. Like you shouldn't tune it each time you add new option to config.
Jan 02 14:02:37 <UndeadLeech>	Yes, exactly. Everything else wouldn't be acceptable.
Jan 02 14:03:30 <alex``>	jq have a similar syntax
Jan 02 14:03:35 <alex``>	has*
Jan 02 14:03:35 <kchibisov>	maybe we can use `scrolling.history: 10000` and then just translate dots into new lines
Jan 02 14:03:53 <UndeadLeech>	Newlines and indentation! Careful there. :D
Jan 02 14:03:54 <kchibisov>	I mean colon + new line.
Jan 02 14:04:07 <kchibisov>	and indention...
Jan 02 14:04:33 <UndeadLeech>	I mean at that point we might as well have it as separate parameters too.
Jan 02 14:04:40 <UndeadLeech>	I think that would be the unix way.
Jan 02 14:04:47 <alex``>	https://github.com/alexherbo2/krabby/commit/d625bb662901560e311c8a3227d1ce13ed7fb92f#diff-171b240ba817349df923fe7acebbe72dR5
Jan 02 14:04:48 <kchibisov>	unix way...
Jan 02 14:04:58 <UndeadLeech>	If we need to transform it anyways, it doesn't really make things much more complicated.
Jan 02 14:05:00 <alex``>	> jq '.browser_specific_settings.gecko.id = "krabby@mozilla.org"' manifest.json > target/firefox/manifest.json
Jan 02 14:05:14 <alex``>	pretty convenient syntax
Jan 02 14:05:45 <UndeadLeech>	Yeah, I didn't come up with this. Neither did `jq`. It's a pretty common format and I believe other terminals work similarly.
Jan 02 14:06:29 <alex``>	is jwilm still on the project?
Jan 02 14:06:56 <UndeadLeech>	Currently he's busy with other things unrelated to Alacritty.
Jan 02 14:06:57 <alex``>	it looks he have abandonned the development Alacritty
Jan 02 14:07:11 <kchibisov>	Well our development is quite active as you can see.

Jan 02 17:24:06 <Levanx>	(This pretty clearly should be the repo image for alacritty imho :D)
Jan 02 17:24:49 <kchibisov>	Levanx: true, I already tried to convince UndeadLeech to change a picture to something more fun.
Jan 02 17:25:29 <UndeadLeech>	Levanx: You're not the first one to say that.
Jan 02 17:25:44 <UndeadLeech>	Though last time it was a big thinking emoji. :P
Jan 02 17:26:09 <UndeadLeech>	kchibisov: So currently we only scale it, if it has color? In retrospect, that very clearly seems wrong.
Jan 02 17:26:17 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:26:36 <UndeadLeech>	And you're saying it's only possible to make these emojis monochrome in Alacritty? Not in fontconfig?
Jan 02 17:26:52 <UndeadLeech>	Sounds strange.
Jan 02 17:26:59 <kchibisov>	Yeah, I wasn't able to make them monochrome in fontconfig
Jan 02 17:27:28 <UndeadLeech>	Huh.
Jan 02 17:27:38 <kchibisov>	Our handling seems fine tbh.
Jan 02 17:27:39 <UndeadLeech>	Well, proper monochrome emoji fonts are going to look better anyways I suppose.
Jan 02 17:28:05 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean it seems fine? How is color a good way to determine if a glyph needs to be scaled?
Jan 02 17:28:06 <kchibisov>	`let color = pat.color().next().unwrap_or(false);`
Jan 02 17:28:15 <kchibisov>	no, I'm about fontconfig check
Jan 02 17:28:27 <UndeadLeech>	You mean the embedded bitmap crash?
Jan 02 17:28:32 <kchibisov>	No color check
Jan 02 17:28:48 <kchibisov>	I mean I should be able to disable the thing
Jan 02 17:29:04 <UndeadLeech>	Oh, you mean that you should be able to set it from fontconfig, gotcha.
Jan 02 17:29:07 <kchibisov>	it's even default to false.
Jan 02 17:29:59 <kchibisov>	Well we can't strip an alpha channel from this non colored emojis
Jan 02 17:30:13 <UndeadLeech>	What do you mean?
Jan 02 17:30:25 <kchibisov>	I mean they do have alpha.
Jan 02 17:30:41 <UndeadLeech>	How is that a problem?
Jan 02 17:31:21 <kchibisov>	I mean do you want to color them with escape or not afterwards?
Jan 02 17:32:00 <UndeadLeech>	Ouh that's a really good question.
Jan 02 17:32:14 <UndeadLeech>	You mean since they come in a BGRA buffer, we'd basically handle them like colored emojis?
Jan 02 17:32:19 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:32:31 <kchibisov>	I mean their pixels are RGBA
Jan 02 17:32:37 <kchibisov>	so it's a colored thing for our renderer
Jan 02 17:32:39 <UndeadLeech>	Does that happen with them right now already?
Jan 02 17:32:47 <kchibisov>	yeah.
Jan 02 17:32:53 <UndeadLeech>	I'd just keep it that way, but scale them tbh.
Jan 02 17:33:08 <UndeadLeech>	I doubt anyone would use them, but if they do, we at least don't have them massive.
Jan 02 17:33:13 <kchibisov>	Well, it seems like they're being colored properly tbh
Jan 02 17:33:27 <UndeadLeech>	But BGRA aren't colored, right?
Jan 02 17:33:31 <UndeadLeech>	RGBA*
Jan 02 17:33:39 <UndeadLeech>	We use that to determine color, aren't we?
Jan 02 17:33:45 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:34:03 <kchibisov>	I feel like there's something odd with this thing.
Jan 02 17:34:09 <kchibisov>	like I don't understand it.
Jan 02 17:34:22 <UndeadLeech>	I mean in theory converting to alpha mask should be trivial, but it's work that probably is never going to pay off.
Jan 02 17:34:25 <kchibisov>	we're setting #ffffff color for them, but you can still color it.
Jan 02 17:34:37 <UndeadLeech>	It seems very odd then, yeah.
Jan 02 17:34:46 <UndeadLeech>	With a black background?
Jan 02 17:34:50 <kchibisov>	yes
Jan 02 17:35:25 <UndeadLeech>	I mean it's the only place where we pass color to the renderer. So it should be impossible.
Jan 02 17:35:34 <kchibisov>	magic.
Jan 02 17:35:43 <kchibisov>	wait.
Jan 02 17:35:45 <UndeadLeech>	That's what it sounds like. Unless it's not an RGBA buffer.
Jan 02 17:35:55 *	UndeadLeech waits.
Jan 02 17:40:01 <kchibisov>	It's not BGRA...
Jan 02 17:40:27 <kchibisov>	It's GRAY.
Jan 02 17:42:51 <kchibisov>	Ehm, now it's interesting, we should downscale gray thing.
Jan 02 17:49:46 <kchibisov>	What do you thing about downsampling everything with fixupfactor less then a 1?
Jan 02 17:49:51 <kchibisov>	s/thing/think
Jan 02 19:51:05 <UndeadLeech>	I'd have to check how we compute the fixup factor again. Is that computed at all?
Jan 02 19:51:22 <UndeadLeech>	Will fonts always provide it, even if it's a 'normal' glyph?
Jan 02 21:41:23 <UndeadLeech>	I think I just fixed the last bug of the 0.4.1 milestone, now we wait for winit/glutin.
Jan 02 22:42:34 <cole-h>	🎉

Feb 19 12:58:25 <DemonLord>	You can move `h` and `l` only on wrapped lines, I don't really like the idea about always moving them. `0` and `$` proposed behavior seems nice, so we can probably do the same.
