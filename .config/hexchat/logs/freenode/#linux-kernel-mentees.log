Jan 27 19:24:38 <RMPR>	Hello, I'm applying to the Linux kernel Bug Fixing Spring 2021 program. I don't know how to complete this task https://imgur.com/Ihh8iSB I already subscribed to the mailing list. And the wiki it's referring to (https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/lkmp) doesn't seem to contain information about what to submit.
Jan 27 19:41:16 <igrtrrt>	Maybe this help https://forum.linuxfoundation.org/discussion/858273/linux-kernel-mentorship#latest
Jan 27 19:44:16 <RMPR>	Thanks
Jan 27 19:45:31 <igrtrrt>	:)

Jan 30 11:16:41 <gregkh>	erikh: link to the patch submission to fix the issue?
Jan 30 11:16:46 <gregkh>	erikh: and nice work, thanks!
Jan 30 11:19:52 <erikh>	https://gist.github.com/erikh/15ada8f6745a4017e025576078a89a27 against latest master; they're not ... 100% behind this patch :)
Jan 30 11:20:26 <erikh>	I think my code comments did more to cause that problem than anything
Jan 30 11:24:15 <gregkh>	erikh: link to thread?  plain text attachments are a good thing, everyone should want that to happen :)
Jan 30 11:24:30 <erikh>	it's in #aerc, just a short irc sortie
Jan 30 11:24:51 <erikh>	I can paste the backlog somewhere. sec.
Jan 30 11:25:23 <erikh>	q-p seems like a safe bet there. 7bit could be used too, but we'd probably want to scan the file before setting it
Jan 30 11:26:32 <erikh>	here's the backlog: https://gist.github.com/erikh/eb49b51d930b151633434ee514428176
