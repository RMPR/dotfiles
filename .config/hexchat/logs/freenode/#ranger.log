May 18 20:23:26 <vifon>	Hm, I wonder if this 144 Hz craze will extend the life of my hardware…  People these days want to play in 4K in 144 Hz.  If I'm fine with 1080p and 60 Hz and the devs are targeting 4K and 144 Hz, it should give me a year or two extra.

May 18 20:29:45 <blawiz>	vifon: you have 144 hz?
May 18 20:29:57 <vifon>	No.
May 18 20:30:14 <blawiz>	you are saying 60hz lasts longer vifon ?
May 18 20:30:21 *	xcm (~xcm@ipa210.225.tellas.gr) has joined
May 18 20:30:33 <vifon>	I mean that I don't need as beefy PC for 60 FPS as for 144 FPS.
May 18 20:30:46 <vifon>	So maybe I can wait with upgrading a year or two more.
May 18 20:30:48 <blawiz>	ah yes
May 18 20:31:55 <blawiz>	do you know if its a problem to choose one thats wider than normal?
May 18 20:32:40 <vifon>	What do you plan to do on it?
May 18 20:34:16 <blawiz>	oh ... you know, terminal, web, movies
May 18 20:34:23 <vifon>	For gaming I wouldn't bother but I play many indie titles.  The AAA games probably support it excellently.
May 18 20:34:37 <vifon>	For work… might be a hit or miss but sounds sweet with proper tiling.
May 18 20:36:07 <blawiz>	was thinking a bit that maybe could be used up close and far away :>
May 18 20:36:32 <blawiz>	but i suppose 27" 1920x1080 is good
May 18 20:37:05 <blawiz>	my intel nuc has a displayport out, doesnt seem very pop
May 18 20:37:28 <blawiz>	seems displayport2dvi is normal, but then you lose audio as i understand
May 18 20:38:44 <blawiz>	oh actually displayport seems pop

Jun 16 20:07:08 <__monty__>	Nope.
Jun 16 20:07:54 <__monty__>	You might even have to turn off preview_images altogether, cause it's a textual method.
Jun 16 20:08:09 <grobi>	hmmm

Jun 16 20:13:58 <grobi>	i set 'set preview_images false' now and 'set preview_images_method libcaca' , but :/ nothing
Jun 16 20:14:02 <__monty__>	Yep, you have to disable image preview.
Jun 16 20:14:13 <__monty__>	So you don't need to specify a method at all.
Jun 16 20:14:19 <grobi>	aha
Jun 16 20:14:31 <__monty__>	And you *might* have to uncomment it in scope.sh
Jun 16 20:15:18 <grobi>	scope.sh in /etc/ranger/ ?
Jun 16 20:16:00 <__monty__>	No, that's for system-wide config.
Jun 16 20:16:21 <__monty__>	You should be editing ~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ranger/scope.sh
Jun 16 20:16:32 <__monty__>	Or .config if the var is empty.

Jun 16 20:51:19 <grobi>	what else am i missing?
Jun 16 20:51:50 <__monty__>	You need to uncomment the image/*) case.
Jun 16 20:57:44 <grobi>	still nothing
Jun 16 20:59:35 <__monty__>	You need to change `use_preview_script /some/path` in `~/.config/ranger/rc.conf`.

Jun 22 21:46:48 <zaeph>	Hi everyone!
Jun 22 21:47:49 <zaeph>	Little achievement of the day: I've finally breached the 1000-commit mark on GitHub!  https://paste.xinu.at/UW1i/
Jun 22 21:48:05 <zaeph>	Not too shabby for a first year. :)
Jun 22 22:00:31 <blawiz>	gj ranger o7

Jun 22 22:06:06 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to hut
Jun 22 22:07:13 <hut>	so are we going to drop python2 support by the end of the year?
Jun 22 22:09:55 *	xcm has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jun 22 22:10:25 <zaeph>	hut: Is that a reference to the 32-bit debacle with Ubuntu?
Jun 22 22:10:31 *	xcm (~xcm@ipa210.225.tellas.gr) has joined
Jun 22 22:16:48 <hut>	I haven't heard of that
Jun 22 22:20:37 <hut>	ah, actually I did
Jun 22 22:23:20 <hut>	but no, it's not a reference ^^
Jun 22 22:23:56 <hut>	zaeph: do you have any new versions of the ranger logo? We shouldn't procrastinate releasing it too much :D
Jun 22 22:25:30 <zaeph>	hut: I've been off the project to focus on my exams, and they're about done (the last is next Friday).  I'm not too enthused about the idea of finishing the logo quite yet, but that might change.
Jun 22 22:25:52 <hut>	we can just use this one for the time being: http://hut.pm/ranger312.png
Jun 22 22:26:21 <zaeph>	Can't remember which version that was, but yes, feel free to use it on the main page. :)
Jun 22 22:26:22 <hut>	and fine-tune it later
Jun 22 22:26:42 <zaeph>	Sounds good to me.
Jun 22 22:27:04 <hut>	we dont have to get it 100% right from the start (although temporary solutions tend to stick around forever...)
Jun 22 22:27:32 <hut>	what are you studying, btw?
Jun 22 22:27:37 <hut>	good luck on friday
Jun 22 22:27:55 <zaeph>	Getting it 100% right from the get go has claimed many of my good ideas because I just couldn't implement them how I wanted. :(
Jun 22 22:28:17 <zaeph>	I'm finishing up my diploma to become an English teacher in France.  That'll pay the bill whilst I figure out what to do with the rest of my life.
Jun 22 22:28:30 <zaeph>	And thanks for the 'good luck'!
Jun 22 22:28:47 <hut>	oh, where do you live?
Jun 22 22:28:48 <zaeph>	Looking forward to getting back to dev funsies.
Jun 22 22:28:57 <hut>	i live right next to france, in cologne :)
Jun 22 22:29:18 <zaeph>	That's great!  I'm from Brittany, though, so that's the opposite end of France.
Jun 22 22:30:06 <zaeph>	What was that about Python 2?  Are we planning on dropping support because of some bad news upstream?
Jun 22 22:30:12 <zaeph>	s/bad/big
Jun 22 22:30:13 <RoboBob>	Correction, <zaeph> What was that about Python 2?  Are we planning on dropping support because of some big news upstream?
Jun 22 22:30:20 <hut>	wellllll yeah
Jun 22 22:30:43 <zaeph>	Oh, 2020?
Jun 22 22:30:46 <zaeph>	Damn.
Jun 22 22:31:04 <hut>	i see that you found it before I could post a link^^
Jun 22 22:31:08 <hut>	yup
Jun 22 22:31:11 <hut>	bold move
Jun 22 22:31:45 <zaeph>	Well, I mean, when your motto is that there's one and only one way to do something, it's kind of funny that they've maintained two branches for so long.
Jun 22 22:32:02 <hut>	yeah...
Jun 22 22:32:14 <zaeph>	I hope it won't give Perl's devs any idea; I'm about to embark on Perl 5.

Jun 22 22:54:23 <hut>	wut, we have ranger-like navigation on the website of ranger
Jun 22 22:54:39 <zaeph>	Yeah! :D

Jul 11 11:46:05 <zaeph>	I've spent all morning implementing the ideas I had yesterday, but it's so sprawling that I'm spending more time pacing in my room than writing code.
Jul 11 11:46:57 <zaeph>	But the good thing is that everything is implemented.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but it *works*!
Jul 11 12:22:43 <__monty__>	Sounds rough.
Jul 11 12:23:21 <__monty__>	I'm still translating my configs into home-manager. Doing the linux service bits as well even though I won't be able to use them because I don't want to go through this again : )
Jul 11 12:23:33 <zaeph>	Hehe. :)
Jul 11 12:24:07 <zaeph>	To be frank, after spending so much energy on org-mode, I think it'll put nixlang into perspective. :p
Jul 11 12:24:26 <__monty__>	What *is* cool is I'm *finally* merging the configs I have on different machines.
Jul 11 12:26:40 <zaeph>	Which will be a massive relief when you're finished.
Jul 11 12:28:04 <zaeph>	I'm only waiting for us two to have fully migrated to NixOS only to have NixOS reveal their new shiny business model with a 99.99 USD/month.
Jul 11 12:29:30 <zaeph>	That, or the devs reveal their death-culty intentions.
Jul 11 12:52:52 <__monty__>	Then we switch to GuixSD.
Jul 11 12:53:15 <zaeph>	Yeah, we'll always be able to find something.
Jul 11 13:18:32 <__monty__>	Hmm, been addicted to Adam Savage's One Day Builds for the last two days. Productivity has tanked...
Jul 11 13:19:30 <zaeph>	Oh, I've started Hannibal 3 days ago and I've only got 4 episodes left.  Don't worry, you're not alone.
Jul 11 13:25:08 <__monty__>	vifon: TLDR the difference between a login shell and an interactive shell is?
Jul 11 13:26:35 <vifon>	Login shell is a shell you used to log in yourself.
Jul 11 13:29:12 <crose>	One of the main difference in practice, is the set of files which are sourced by the shell.
Jul 11 13:29:25 <crose>	For zsh, I think it's: https://0x0.st/zLR6.txt
Jul 11 13:29:27 <vifon>	Yes, indeed.
Jul 11 13:31:23 <crose>	For bash, it's more complex, but if you tweak `~/.bash_profile`, you can simplify it like this: https://0x0.st/zLRI.txt
Jul 11 13:32:14 <crose>	This is how I do it: https://github.com/lacygoill/config/blob/master/.bash_profile
Jul 11 13:32:37 <zaeph>	crose: I like your tables, they look fancy.
Jul 11 13:32:58 <crose>	Thanks, I've got a hacky Vim key binding to generate them.
Jul 11 13:34:00 <zaeph>	They look much better than my org-mode tables. :(
Jul 11 13:34:51 <zaeph>	…Although that's mostly due to the fact that your code can handle multicells.
Jul 11 14:05:18 <__monty__>	crose: I guess I meant more, how do I know in which quadrant I am (gonna be)?
Jul 11 14:06:12 <__monty__>	Like, what is a non-login interactive shell?
Jul 11 14:06:38 <__monty__>	And a non-interactive login shell for that matter.
Jul 11 14:06:49 <__monty__>	I assume I'm mostly working in interactive login shells?
Jul 11 14:12:00 <crose>	I'm not sure, and I don't have reviewed these concepts since a long time, but for me an interactive shell is a shell in which you can write commands, edit them (probably with readline key bindings), and run them by pressing Enter.
Jul 11 14:12:06 <crose>	When you run a bash script, the shell which is run to interpret the script is non-interactive: there's no way for you to interact with it (well, unless it asks you for some info, but that's limited).
Jul 11 14:12:11 <crose>	As for login shells, those are rare.
Jul 11 14:12:14 <crose>	For example, when you open a virtual console (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F1), the login process is running.
Jul 11 14:12:18 <crose>	It asks for your credentials, and if if they're good, it gives you a shell.
Jul 11 14:12:21 <crose>	I think this shell is a login shell.
Jul 11 14:12:24 <crose>	You can also start a login shell by passing the right flag to the command invoking the shell.
Jul 11 14:12:27 <crose>	For bash it's `-l` (i.e. `$ bash -l`).
Jul 11 14:12:30 <crose>	I think you're mostly working in interactive non-login shells.
Jul 11 14:19:22 <crose>	I've just found a way to determine whether you're in a login shell, from here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/237672/289772
Jul 11 14:19:29 <crose>	If the first character in the output of `echo $0` is a hyphen, then you're in an interactive login shell, otherwise you're in an interactive non-login shell.
Jul 11 14:50:14 <__monty__>	crose: Thanks. I think I get it.
Jul 11 14:50:16 <__monty__>	gtg
Jul 11 14:50:20 <__monty__>	Have a nice day!
Jul 11 14:50:29 <crose>	Thanks, you too.
Jul 11 15:37:49 <vifon>	zaeph: http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/07/infinite-work-is-less-work.html
Jul 11 15:38:48 <zaeph>	vifon: I'll have a read when I'm done eating!
Jul 11 15:41:28 <vifon>	Do we have any electronics gurus here?
Jul 11 15:42:07 <vifon>	I want to attach a switch to a USB cable to enable/disable the device without actually unplugging it.
Jul 11 15:42:27 <Sout>	ah i have something for you :D
Jul 11 15:42:29 <vifon>	If I cut the 5V red wire and solder it there, should it work?
Jul 11 15:42:40 <Sout>	https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub
Jul 11 15:43:21 <vifon>	Don't get me started on hubs.  I just returned the 4th one.
Jul 11 15:48:38 <Sout>	err not sure, (i think so) but also ignore the wire colours. map the wires to pins and then figure out the power pin etc.
Jul 11 15:50:22 <Sout>	and I'm assuming this is not usb type c
Jul 11 15:53:44 <Sout>	and quick google of schematics, showed this. https://www.yepkit.com/products/ykush looks like they are switching off the vcc. (though the usb ic might be doing other things)
Jul 11 15:55:12 <vifon>	I'm more concerned about things like shielding.  Should I pay attention to it?
Jul 11 15:57:51 <Sout>	ah it depends? (on your application and data rate etc, if your worried about rf radiation). i would think for most normal uses (mice keyboards, controllers etc) it should still work. but that is definiatly out of my scope. 
Jul 11 15:58:54 <vifon>	It's for USB headphones.
Jul 11 15:59:06 <vifon>	And the cable I'm ripping apart has 20 cm.
Jul 11 15:59:26 <vifon>	I bought 3 cables just to have more "lives".'
Jul 11 15:59:32 <Sout>	ah it says . The board performs the power switching of the downstream ports by switching the VBUS lines. For some self-powered USB devices (USB devices that use an external power supply to draw power) the additional switching of the data-lines may be required to fully disconnect the device. For these cases please check the YKUSH 3 board.

Jul 15 20:04:39 <zaeph>	Wow, that is so cool: https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/ .
Jul 15 20:11:34 <zaeph>	I'm not sure what I find so appealing about tests and backtraces.  Maybe it's because I realise how stupid I've been not to use them in the past, pressing all the buttons or nudging stuff left and right until it worked rather than gaining an understanding of what was going on.
Jul 15 20:12:32 <zaeph>	I mean, debuggers aren't a panacea, and they aren't a substitute for understanding the code.  But when you're stumbling on a code-base that is so large and abstruse as org's, you'll be glad to have some tools to investigate the flow.
Jul 15 20:21:20 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Hey folks, I asked over the weekend, but was offline for a bit so might have missed a reply. Sorry for asking twice; Is there a way to change / mask "user@host" in the ranger interface? I have some screen captures for work I'd like to do but don't want that info in them.
Jul 15 20:21:57 <zaeph>	ParallaxDenigrat: Hi.  Do you mean the user@host at the top left of the ranger window?
Jul 15 20:22:17 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Yep, and if I could get rid of the usernam in the status bar by permissions that would be great too.
Jul 15 20:22:27 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I'm guessing that would take a compile from scratch after a patch?
Jul 15 20:22:30 <zaeph>	If it's just for a screenshot, why not run it as root?
Jul 15 20:22:40 <zaeph>	You'd still have your host, but your username would be obfuscated.
Jul 15 20:22:58 <ParallaxDenigrat>	It's not just for one screenshot, I do lots of short screencasts for things like POC and stuff.
Jul 15 20:23:22 <__monty__>	You can hide the hostname with `set hostname_in_titlebar false`.
Jul 15 20:23:24 <zaeph>	Apparently there's a setting, `set hostname_in_titlebar true`
Jul 15 20:23:25 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Honestly, I can switch to a root terminal each time if I have to, just thought I'd ask.
Jul 15 20:23:28 <zaeph>	Damn you __monty__ .
Jul 15 20:23:31 <ParallaxDenigrat>	wayt
Jul 15 20:23:34 <ParallaxDenigrat>	wat, seriously?
Jul 15 20:23:45 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I freaking read every line of the config files hahaha
Jul 15 20:23:51 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Well that's half way there. Thanks!
Jul 15 20:24:31 <zaeph>	Half way?  it also removes your host.
Jul 15 20:24:44 <zaeph>	Just try `:set hostname_in_titlebar false` in ranger.
Jul 15 20:24:54 <zaeph>	(You have to move the selection for it to refresh.)
Jul 15 20:25:26 <zaeph>	Oh, unless you meant the path to the visited folder.  You could always run something in /tmp/ if that bothers you.
Jul 15 20:27:26 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Ahhh, think  I have to update
Jul 15 20:27:45 <zaeph>	Moving the selection didn't work?
Jul 15 20:27:49 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I'm on 1.8.1 abd that doesn't seem to be an option.
Jul 15 20:28:09 <zaeph>	Let me try on my end.
Jul 15 20:28:37 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: A kludge I just came up with, modify a colorscheme to have identical fg/bg colors in `context.in_titlebar` and it won't be visible?
Jul 15 20:28:53 <zaeph>	Yeah, doesn't exist in 1.8.1.
Jul 15 20:29:27 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: But if I were you I'd probably just patch ranger so you can censor the user@host, setting it arbitrarily.
Jul 15 20:29:27 <ParallaxDenigrat>	__monty__ that's a great idea!
Jul 15 20:29:54 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Honestly patching it is probably my plan, just wanted to check.
Jul 15 20:29:57 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Thanks for the help!
Jul 15 20:30:09 <zaeph>	Any time!
Jul 15 20:30:41 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: Oh, ha. Better yet.
Jul 15 20:38:06 <__monty__>	map <alt>i eval self.fm.username='¯\\_('; self.fm.hostname='_@)_/¯'; self.fm.redraw_window()
Jul 15 20:38:25 <__monty__>	Enter that exact string at the console, invoked with :, or put it in rc.conf
Jul 15 20:38:54 <__monty__>	Then press <alt>i (for "incognito") to see what happens : )

Oct 11 22:12:53 <vifon>	__monty__: I patched my CloudBot instance with proper s/// support.  It works seamlessly.  Would you be interested in applying this patch here?  (I would!)
Oct 11 22:13:14 <__monty__>	Sure.
Oct 11 22:13:24 <vifon>	I didn't replace the original code, just injected my additions there.
Oct 11 22:13:57 <vifon>	Patch: http://dpaste.com/3WBG49W
Oct 11 22:14:23 <vifon>	Uses https://gist.github.com/Vifon/0c91a8fd917b186f61c2c5388c6f9c9e , place it in the contrib directory of the main CloudBot directory.
Oct 11 22:15:26 <__monty__>	Wait, you just want s/// to be an alias for re///?
Oct 11 22:15:44 <vifon>	Well, yes.
Oct 11 22:16:17 <vifon>	Because, ugh!
Oct 11 22:16:49 <vifon>	I'm not sure what's the implementation of your re/// but this one should as robust as the original one.
Oct 11 22:18:34 <vifon>	(or as non-robust)

Oct 11 22:34:49 <vifon>	Exactly like this.
Oct 11 22:34:53 <vifon>	Did you apply the patch?
Oct 11 22:38:19 <__monty__>	No, just checking out the original code to see what's different.
Oct 11 22:38:52 <vifon>	The original doesn't even use regexps.
Oct 11 22:38:59 <vifon>	Or rather escapes them beforehand.
Oct 11 22:41:13 <__monty__>	It does though. And doesn't. Respectively.
Oct 11 22:41:25 <__monty__>	re/l(.*)i/\1
Oct 11 22:41:26 <RoboBob>	Correction, <__monty__> No, just checking out the origina code to see what's dfferent.

Oct 11 22:57:22 <vifon>	Well, a parser for the s/// expressions.
Oct 11 22:58:06 <__monty__>	How does it differ from what's in cloudbot? Looks so similar.
Oct 11 22:58:48 <vifon>	For one, it extracts the flags and translates them to a form edible for Python's re module.
Oct 11 22:59:41 <__monty__>	Cloudbot already does i,g and x though.
Oct 11 22:59:56 <vifon>	No, it just eats it up.
Oct 11 23:00:05 <vifon>	It doesn't interpret them.
Oct 11 23:02:16 <__monty__>	I'm basically sure re// is already your sedophile code >.<
Oct 11 23:02:28 <vifon>	Yes, I think so.
Oct 11 23:02:57 <vifon>	But back then I didn't convince you to make s/// use it. :>
Oct 11 23:03:28 <__monty__>	Well, I don't know why s// doesn't work yet. Keep getting key errors when it tries to retrieve history for '#ranger'
Oct 11 23:03:58 <__monty__>	Note that I reserve the right to replace s// with actual sed/vim whenever.
Oct 11 23:04:28 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Oct 11 23:04:31 <vifon>	Hereby I grant you this right.
Oct 11 23:40:46 <ublawiz>	You left them alone in a room with a penguin?! Mr Gates, your men are already dead.

Oct 19 22:00:46 <__monty__>	Has the file been committed?
Oct 19 22:03:56 <aRkedos>	yes
Oct 19 22:04:50 <aRkedos>	and I have a binding in VIM to remove that stuff
Oct 19 22:15:40 <aRkedos>	well maybe I make a new fork :/
Oct 19 22:15:54 <__monty__>	Shouldn't be necessary.
Oct 19 22:16:05 <aRkedos>	yeah but seems easier to me ^^
Oct 19 22:19:14 <__monty__>	It's actually a valuable learning experience to do it the right way though. Btw, `:set list` in vim will show you whitespace characters.
Oct 19 22:19:50 <__monty__>	Oh, but I think it doesn't do spaces by default. Check the vim wiki for how to do that though.
Oct 19 22:20:12 <__monty__>	nn, peoples
Oct 19 22:25:10 <aRkedos>	ah thanks __monty__
Oct 20 00:18:50 <Boobuigi>	Thank goodness for idle_delay.  Without it set, ranger (even when its terminal window was not even visible) was using 5~7% CPU on my Raspberry Pi.
Oct 20 00:20:58 <Boobuigi>	Anyone thought about setting that by default?  I think the default is 1 millisecond, but the default rc.conf has it set to 2000?!
Oct 20 00:21:31 *	Boobuigi is happy with 200 for now.
Oct 20 00:34:28 <vifon>	Boobuigi: Wait, so what's wrong with it being 2000 by default?
Oct 20 00:36:34 <Boobuigi>	Isn't that a two-second delay?  Maybe I'm confused.
Oct 20 00:37:35 <Boobuigi>	OK, maybe not.  I just tested it.
Oct 20 00:38:25 <Boobuigi>	Reading documentation, I figured it was the equivalent of calling sleep 2.000 in the main loop.
Oct 20 00:39:13 <aRkedos>	vifon is it possible to somehow extract the signal_name attribute within a function bound to a signal?
Oct 20 00:39:18 <Boobuigi>	I just set it to 20000, though (expecting up to twenty-second input lag), but there was no lag at all.
Oct 20 00:39:44 <vifon>	Boobuigi: I think it's about directory refresh.
Oct 20 00:40:12 <vifon>	aRkedos: It was a few years since I worked directly with our signals, let me see…
Oct 20 00:43:34 <vifon>	aRkedos: Did you try using the pass_signal parameter?
Oct 20 00:43:55 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L267
Oct 20 00:44:10 <vifon>	It seems when it's set, your handler gets the signal object passed.
Oct 20 00:50:06 <aRkedos>	well I only work with an Instance of Signal which has no such attribute, I am still trying to merge my 2 methods for toggling the status and titlebar into one, but for that need to pass the respective widget object
Oct 20 00:50:27 <aRkedos>	thing is that if you bind a signal to that method the signal itselfs gets passed onto that function
Oct 20 00:50:35 <aRkedos>	so you cant pass the widget object
Oct 20 00:51:11 <Boobuigi>	vifon: Ah, that's all it applies to?  Thanks for the clarification.
Oct 20 00:59:47 <vifon>	aRkedos: OK, I see now…  When you pass a function that takes any arguments, it gets enabled automatically.
Oct 20 00:59:56 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L142
Oct 20 01:00:00 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L151
Oct 20 01:00:10 <vifon>	As for passing additional data…
Oct 20 01:00:30 <vifon>	Since you're new, I'm hesitant to suggest it, but closures could help here.
Oct 20 01:00:39 <vifon>	But it's a tricky concept for some.
Oct 20 01:01:32 <vifon>	aRkedos: Basically the function you bind there would be:
Oct 20 01:01:35 <vifon>	   lambda sig: do_something(sig, widget)
Oct 20 01:01:49 <vifon>	Or a named equivalent (even better).

Nov 07 14:21:37 <vifon>	I know of no full public logging over here.

Nov 07 14:21:54 <vifon>	Luyin: It's in the channel topic.

Nov 07 14:23:06 <Luyin>	IRC is not a suitable medium for privacy
Nov 07 14:23:21 <Luyin>	matrix.org I think can provide that, and is the most similar to IRC
Nov 07 14:23:45 <vifon>	We use it at work. It's ok.
Nov 07 14:23:52 <Luyin>	vifon: really?
Nov 07 14:24:03 <Luyin>	I guess private network? :)
Nov 07 14:24:09 <vifon>	Yeah, for 2 years or so already.

Nov 07 14:24:50 <Luyin>	we use mattermost. I really like that. if only people understood the reply button
Nov 07 14:25:24 <vifon>	We migrated from Mattermost after a yet another outage.
Nov 07 14:25:42 <vifon>	I don't remember what went wrong right now.
Nov 07 14:26:22 <Luyin>	 vifon spoke a total of 278476 words!
Nov 07 14:26:24 <Luyin>	vifon's faithful follower, __monty__, didn't speak so much: 271368 words.

Nov 07 14:26:29 <Luyin>	the stats are great
Nov 07 14:26:32 <Luyin>	useless but great
Nov 07 14:28:33 <__monty__>	Still, people *expect* privacy from queries.

Nov 07 22:05:33 <__monty__>	Really?
Nov 07 22:05:48 <__monty__>	Are you sure you're on the right branch?
Nov 07 22:05:54 <__monty__>	What's the commit?
Nov 07 22:06:11 <__monty__>	7aafd6?
Nov 07 22:06:14 <zaeph>	Uh, now it works.  Weird.
Nov 07 22:06:25 <zaeph>	Or wait, maybe I went back to master.
Nov 07 22:06:29 <__monty__>	: s
Nov 07 22:06:37 <__monty__>	This is getting more and more confusing!
Nov 07 22:07:07 <zaeph>	All right, so now I can launch it.  Not sure where the problem was.
Nov 07 22:09:49 <zaeph>	'bla' wasn't deleted.
Nov 07 22:10:10 <zaeph>	And no 'foo' as a file anymore.
Nov 07 22:13:13 <__monty__>	And the message at the bottom telling you you're doing it wrong?
Nov 07 22:14:59 <zaeph>	__monty__: 'Failed to paste.  The destination is invalid.'
Nov 07 22:15:09 <__monty__>	Sweet.
Nov 07 22:19:04 <Pepe_vulgaris>	ranger just blew my mind
Nov 07 22:19:43 <Pepe_vulgaris>	:rename dir/subdir renames olddir to dir and moves everything in it to a new subdir called subdir
Nov 07 22:20:43 <__monty__>	That's mkdir -p for you : )
Nov 07 22:21:36 <Pepe_vulgaris>	mkdir does not move contents, also a simple mv won't take care about the possible dotfiles
Nov 07 22:34:11 <__monty__>	Possible dotfiles?
Nov 07 22:34:47 <__monty__>	No, I meant we fairly recently added `-p` to `:bulkrename`'s functioning.
Nov 07 22:35:25 <__monty__>	So we create the target dir first, no matter how many dirs in between don't exist yet. Then we mv.
Nov 07 22:35:29 <zaeph>	I'm off, sleep tight folks!
Nov 07 22:36:42 <__monty__>	nn, zaeph, thanks for confirming it works! Another one down.
Nov 07 22:36:52 <zaeph>	Any time. ;)

Feb 19 13:57:55 <watered>	vifon: I accidentally deleted all .files in my home directory
Feb 19 13:57:56 <watered>	but before it could be deleted I quit
Feb 19 13:58:10 <watered>	Now it shows the space freed up on df and i3-statusbar
Feb 19 13:58:11 <watered>	But the files are still there
Feb 19 13:58:18 <watered>	They are accessible
Feb 19 13:58:29 <watered>	How is that possible
Feb 19 13:58:52 <watered>	I'm scared they are marked for delete on next reboot or will be overwritten during new file transfers
Feb 19 13:59:25 <vifon>	Ranger probably started with one of the first directories there and didn't finish.
Feb 19 13:59:42 <vifon>	It probably deleted some files, just not all of them.
Feb 19 13:59:56 <vifon>	Do you have any backups?
Feb 19 14:00:50 <vifon>	If not, shutdown the system NOW, boot up some system from live USB and try tools like PhotoRec.
Feb 19 14:01:26 <watered>	vifon: But is it possible for such a thing to happen?
Feb 19 14:02:56 <vifon>	watered: Definitely.  Ranger cannot delete everything at once.  It goes file by file.
Feb 19 14:03:13 <watered>	vifon: But does it use the rm command?
Feb 19 14:03:23 <vifon>	Probably the unlink syscall.
Feb 19 14:03:24 <watered>	Everything I want seems to be there
Feb 19 14:03:48 <watered>	What is the actual name? 'unlink syscall'?
Feb 19 14:04:02 <watered>	is it possible to reverse that without rebooting?
Feb 19 14:04:22 <watered>	I'm worried if I reboot it will all go
Feb 19 14:04:24 <vifon>	Well, you can think about it as the rm command, yes.
Feb 19 14:05:05 <vifon>	watered: Rebooting won't make it worse than it is.
Feb 19 14:09:01 <watered>	vifon: I can see the files now and open them...! What if the link is in ram that's why I can still see them?
Feb 19 14:17:18 <vifon>	watered: Not possible.
Feb 19 14:18:07 <vifon>	The removed files that are still open are no longer visible.
Feb 19 14:18:08 <vifon>	The files you can see are fine.
