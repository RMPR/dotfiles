May 18 20:23:26 <vifon>	Hm, I wonder if this 144 Hz craze will extend the life of my hardware…  People these days want to play in 4K in 144 Hz.  If I'm fine with 1080p and 60 Hz and the devs are targeting 4K and 144 Hz, it should give me a year or two extra.

May 18 20:29:45 <blawiz>	vifon: you have 144 hz?
May 18 20:29:57 <vifon>	No.
May 18 20:30:14 <blawiz>	you are saying 60hz lasts longer vifon ?
May 18 20:30:21 *	xcm (~xcm@ipa210.225.tellas.gr) has joined
May 18 20:30:33 <vifon>	I mean that I don't need as beefy PC for 60 FPS as for 144 FPS.
May 18 20:30:46 <vifon>	So maybe I can wait with upgrading a year or two more.
May 18 20:30:48 <blawiz>	ah yes
May 18 20:31:55 <blawiz>	do you know if its a problem to choose one thats wider than normal?
May 18 20:32:40 <vifon>	What do you plan to do on it?
May 18 20:34:16 <blawiz>	oh ... you know, terminal, web, movies
May 18 20:34:23 <vifon>	For gaming I wouldn't bother but I play many indie titles.  The AAA games probably support it excellently.
May 18 20:34:37 <vifon>	For work… might be a hit or miss but sounds sweet with proper tiling.
May 18 20:36:07 <blawiz>	was thinking a bit that maybe could be used up close and far away :>
May 18 20:36:32 <blawiz>	but i suppose 27" 1920x1080 is good
May 18 20:37:05 <blawiz>	my intel nuc has a displayport out, doesnt seem very pop
May 18 20:37:28 <blawiz>	seems displayport2dvi is normal, but then you lose audio as i understand
May 18 20:38:44 <blawiz>	oh actually displayport seems pop

Jun 16 20:07:08 <__monty__>	Nope.
Jun 16 20:07:54 <__monty__>	You might even have to turn off preview_images altogether, cause it's a textual method.
Jun 16 20:08:09 <grobi>	hmmm

Jun 16 20:13:58 <grobi>	i set 'set preview_images false' now and 'set preview_images_method libcaca' , but :/ nothing
Jun 16 20:14:02 <__monty__>	Yep, you have to disable image preview.
Jun 16 20:14:13 <__monty__>	So you don't need to specify a method at all.
Jun 16 20:14:19 <grobi>	aha
Jun 16 20:14:31 <__monty__>	And you *might* have to uncomment it in scope.sh
Jun 16 20:15:18 <grobi>	scope.sh in /etc/ranger/ ?
Jun 16 20:16:00 <__monty__>	No, that's for system-wide config.
Jun 16 20:16:21 <__monty__>	You should be editing ~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ranger/scope.sh
Jun 16 20:16:32 <__monty__>	Or .config if the var is empty.

Jun 16 20:51:19 <grobi>	what else am i missing?
Jun 16 20:51:50 <__monty__>	You need to uncomment the image/*) case.
Jun 16 20:57:44 <grobi>	still nothing
Jun 16 20:59:35 <__monty__>	You need to change `use_preview_script /some/path` in `~/.config/ranger/rc.conf`.

Jun 22 21:46:48 <zaeph>	Hi everyone!
Jun 22 21:47:49 <zaeph>	Little achievement of the day: I've finally breached the 1000-commit mark on GitHub!  https://paste.xinu.at/UW1i/
Jun 22 21:48:05 <zaeph>	Not too shabby for a first year. :)
Jun 22 22:00:31 <blawiz>	gj ranger o7

Jun 22 22:06:06 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to hut
Jun 22 22:07:13 <hut>	so are we going to drop python2 support by the end of the year?
Jun 22 22:09:55 *	xcm has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jun 22 22:10:25 <zaeph>	hut: Is that a reference to the 32-bit debacle with Ubuntu?
Jun 22 22:10:31 *	xcm (~xcm@ipa210.225.tellas.gr) has joined
Jun 22 22:16:48 <hut>	I haven't heard of that
Jun 22 22:20:37 <hut>	ah, actually I did
Jun 22 22:23:20 <hut>	but no, it's not a reference ^^
Jun 22 22:23:56 <hut>	zaeph: do you have any new versions of the ranger logo? We shouldn't procrastinate releasing it too much :D
Jun 22 22:25:30 <zaeph>	hut: I've been off the project to focus on my exams, and they're about done (the last is next Friday).  I'm not too enthused about the idea of finishing the logo quite yet, but that might change.
Jun 22 22:25:52 <hut>	we can just use this one for the time being: http://hut.pm/ranger312.png
Jun 22 22:26:21 <zaeph>	Can't remember which version that was, but yes, feel free to use it on the main page. :)
Jun 22 22:26:22 <hut>	and fine-tune it later
Jun 22 22:26:42 <zaeph>	Sounds good to me.
Jun 22 22:27:04 <hut>	we dont have to get it 100% right from the start (although temporary solutions tend to stick around forever...)
Jun 22 22:27:32 <hut>	what are you studying, btw?
Jun 22 22:27:37 <hut>	good luck on friday
Jun 22 22:27:55 <zaeph>	Getting it 100% right from the get go has claimed many of my good ideas because I just couldn't implement them how I wanted. :(
Jun 22 22:28:17 <zaeph>	I'm finishing up my diploma to become an English teacher in France.  That'll pay the bill whilst I figure out what to do with the rest of my life.
Jun 22 22:28:30 <zaeph>	And thanks for the 'good luck'!
Jun 22 22:28:47 <hut>	oh, where do you live?
Jun 22 22:28:48 <zaeph>	Looking forward to getting back to dev funsies.
Jun 22 22:28:57 <hut>	i live right next to france, in cologne :)
Jun 22 22:29:18 <zaeph>	That's great!  I'm from Brittany, though, so that's the opposite end of France.
Jun 22 22:30:06 <zaeph>	What was that about Python 2?  Are we planning on dropping support because of some bad news upstream?
Jun 22 22:30:12 <zaeph>	s/bad/big
Jun 22 22:30:13 <RoboBob>	Correction, <zaeph> What was that about Python 2?  Are we planning on dropping support because of some big news upstream?
Jun 22 22:30:20 <hut>	wellllll yeah
Jun 22 22:30:43 <zaeph>	Oh, 2020?
Jun 22 22:30:46 <zaeph>	Damn.
Jun 22 22:31:04 <hut>	i see that you found it before I could post a link^^
Jun 22 22:31:08 <hut>	yup
Jun 22 22:31:11 <hut>	bold move
Jun 22 22:31:45 <zaeph>	Well, I mean, when your motto is that there's one and only one way to do something, it's kind of funny that they've maintained two branches for so long.
Jun 22 22:32:02 <hut>	yeah...
Jun 22 22:32:14 <zaeph>	I hope it won't give Perl's devs any idea; I'm about to embark on Perl 5.

Jun 22 22:54:23 <hut>	wut, we have ranger-like navigation on the website of ranger
Jun 22 22:54:39 <zaeph>	Yeah! :D

Jul 11 11:46:05 <zaeph>	I've spent all morning implementing the ideas I had yesterday, but it's so sprawling that I'm spending more time pacing in my room than writing code.
Jul 11 11:46:57 <zaeph>	But the good thing is that everything is implemented.  It's a bit rough around the edges, but it *works*!
Jul 11 12:22:43 <__monty__>	Sounds rough.
Jul 11 12:23:21 <__monty__>	I'm still translating my configs into home-manager. Doing the linux service bits as well even though I won't be able to use them because I don't want to go through this again : )
Jul 11 12:23:33 <zaeph>	Hehe. :)
Jul 11 12:24:07 <zaeph>	To be frank, after spending so much energy on org-mode, I think it'll put nixlang into perspective. :p
Jul 11 12:24:26 <__monty__>	What *is* cool is I'm *finally* merging the configs I have on different machines.
Jul 11 12:26:40 <zaeph>	Which will be a massive relief when you're finished.
Jul 11 12:28:04 <zaeph>	I'm only waiting for us two to have fully migrated to NixOS only to have NixOS reveal their new shiny business model with a 99.99 USD/month.
Jul 11 12:29:30 <zaeph>	That, or the devs reveal their death-culty intentions.
Jul 11 12:52:52 <__monty__>	Then we switch to GuixSD.
Jul 11 12:53:15 <zaeph>	Yeah, we'll always be able to find something.
Jul 11 13:18:32 <__monty__>	Hmm, been addicted to Adam Savage's One Day Builds for the last two days. Productivity has tanked...
Jul 11 13:19:30 <zaeph>	Oh, I've started Hannibal 3 days ago and I've only got 4 episodes left.  Don't worry, you're not alone.
Jul 11 13:25:08 <__monty__>	vifon: TLDR the difference between a login shell and an interactive shell is?
Jul 11 13:26:35 <vifon>	Login shell is a shell you used to log in yourself.
Jul 11 13:29:12 <crose>	One of the main difference in practice, is the set of files which are sourced by the shell.
Jul 11 13:29:25 <crose>	For zsh, I think it's: https://0x0.st/zLR6.txt
Jul 11 13:29:27 <vifon>	Yes, indeed.
Jul 11 13:31:23 <crose>	For bash, it's more complex, but if you tweak `~/.bash_profile`, you can simplify it like this: https://0x0.st/zLRI.txt
Jul 11 13:32:14 <crose>	This is how I do it: https://github.com/lacygoill/config/blob/master/.bash_profile
Jul 11 13:32:37 <zaeph>	crose: I like your tables, they look fancy.
Jul 11 13:32:58 <crose>	Thanks, I've got a hacky Vim key binding to generate them.
Jul 11 13:34:00 <zaeph>	They look much better than my org-mode tables. :(
Jul 11 13:34:51 <zaeph>	…Although that's mostly due to the fact that your code can handle multicells.
Jul 11 14:05:18 <__monty__>	crose: I guess I meant more, how do I know in which quadrant I am (gonna be)?
Jul 11 14:06:12 <__monty__>	Like, what is a non-login interactive shell?
Jul 11 14:06:38 <__monty__>	And a non-interactive login shell for that matter.
Jul 11 14:06:49 <__monty__>	I assume I'm mostly working in interactive login shells?
Jul 11 14:12:00 <crose>	I'm not sure, and I don't have reviewed these concepts since a long time, but for me an interactive shell is a shell in which you can write commands, edit them (probably with readline key bindings), and run them by pressing Enter.
Jul 11 14:12:06 <crose>	When you run a bash script, the shell which is run to interpret the script is non-interactive: there's no way for you to interact with it (well, unless it asks you for some info, but that's limited).
Jul 11 14:12:11 <crose>	As for login shells, those are rare.
Jul 11 14:12:14 <crose>	For example, when you open a virtual console (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F1), the login process is running.
Jul 11 14:12:18 <crose>	It asks for your credentials, and if if they're good, it gives you a shell.
Jul 11 14:12:21 <crose>	I think this shell is a login shell.
Jul 11 14:12:24 <crose>	You can also start a login shell by passing the right flag to the command invoking the shell.
Jul 11 14:12:27 <crose>	For bash it's `-l` (i.e. `$ bash -l`).
Jul 11 14:12:30 <crose>	I think you're mostly working in interactive non-login shells.
Jul 11 14:19:22 <crose>	I've just found a way to determine whether you're in a login shell, from here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/237672/289772
Jul 11 14:19:29 <crose>	If the first character in the output of `echo $0` is a hyphen, then you're in an interactive login shell, otherwise you're in an interactive non-login shell.
Jul 11 14:50:14 <__monty__>	crose: Thanks. I think I get it.
Jul 11 14:50:16 <__monty__>	gtg
Jul 11 14:50:20 <__monty__>	Have a nice day!
Jul 11 14:50:29 <crose>	Thanks, you too.
Jul 11 15:37:49 <vifon>	zaeph: http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2019/07/infinite-work-is-less-work.html
Jul 11 15:38:48 <zaeph>	vifon: I'll have a read when I'm done eating!
Jul 11 15:41:28 <vifon>	Do we have any electronics gurus here?
Jul 11 15:42:07 <vifon>	I want to attach a switch to a USB cable to enable/disable the device without actually unplugging it.
Jul 11 15:42:27 <Sout>	ah i have something for you :D
Jul 11 15:42:29 <vifon>	If I cut the 5V red wire and solder it there, should it work?
Jul 11 15:42:40 <Sout>	https://www.crowdsupply.com/capable-robot-components/programmable-usb-hub
Jul 11 15:43:21 <vifon>	Don't get me started on hubs.  I just returned the 4th one.
Jul 11 15:48:38 <Sout>	err not sure, (i think so) but also ignore the wire colours. map the wires to pins and then figure out the power pin etc.
Jul 11 15:50:22 <Sout>	and I'm assuming this is not usb type c
Jul 11 15:53:44 <Sout>	and quick google of schematics, showed this. https://www.yepkit.com/products/ykush looks like they are switching off the vcc. (though the usb ic might be doing other things)
Jul 11 15:55:12 <vifon>	I'm more concerned about things like shielding.  Should I pay attention to it?
Jul 11 15:57:51 <Sout>	ah it depends? (on your application and data rate etc, if your worried about rf radiation). i would think for most normal uses (mice keyboards, controllers etc) it should still work. but that is definiatly out of my scope. 
Jul 11 15:58:54 <vifon>	It's for USB headphones.
Jul 11 15:59:06 <vifon>	And the cable I'm ripping apart has 20 cm.
Jul 11 15:59:26 <vifon>	I bought 3 cables just to have more "lives".'
Jul 11 15:59:32 <Sout>	ah it says . The board performs the power switching of the downstream ports by switching the VBUS lines. For some self-powered USB devices (USB devices that use an external power supply to draw power) the additional switching of the data-lines may be required to fully disconnect the device. For these cases please check the YKUSH 3 board.

Jul 15 20:04:39 <zaeph>	Wow, that is so cool: https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/ .
Jul 15 20:11:34 <zaeph>	I'm not sure what I find so appealing about tests and backtraces.  Maybe it's because I realise how stupid I've been not to use them in the past, pressing all the buttons or nudging stuff left and right until it worked rather than gaining an understanding of what was going on.
Jul 15 20:12:32 <zaeph>	I mean, debuggers aren't a panacea, and they aren't a substitute for understanding the code.  But when you're stumbling on a code-base that is so large and abstruse as org's, you'll be glad to have some tools to investigate the flow.
Jul 15 20:21:20 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Hey folks, I asked over the weekend, but was offline for a bit so might have missed a reply. Sorry for asking twice; Is there a way to change / mask "user@host" in the ranger interface? I have some screen captures for work I'd like to do but don't want that info in them.
Jul 15 20:21:57 <zaeph>	ParallaxDenigrat: Hi.  Do you mean the user@host at the top left of the ranger window?
Jul 15 20:22:17 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Yep, and if I could get rid of the usernam in the status bar by permissions that would be great too.
Jul 15 20:22:27 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I'm guessing that would take a compile from scratch after a patch?
Jul 15 20:22:30 <zaeph>	If it's just for a screenshot, why not run it as root?
Jul 15 20:22:40 <zaeph>	You'd still have your host, but your username would be obfuscated.
Jul 15 20:22:58 <ParallaxDenigrat>	It's not just for one screenshot, I do lots of short screencasts for things like POC and stuff.
Jul 15 20:23:22 <__monty__>	You can hide the hostname with `set hostname_in_titlebar false`.
Jul 15 20:23:24 <zaeph>	Apparently there's a setting, `set hostname_in_titlebar true`
Jul 15 20:23:25 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Honestly, I can switch to a root terminal each time if I have to, just thought I'd ask.
Jul 15 20:23:28 <zaeph>	Damn you __monty__ .
Jul 15 20:23:31 <ParallaxDenigrat>	wayt
Jul 15 20:23:34 <ParallaxDenigrat>	wat, seriously?
Jul 15 20:23:45 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I freaking read every line of the config files hahaha
Jul 15 20:23:51 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Well that's half way there. Thanks!
Jul 15 20:24:31 <zaeph>	Half way?  it also removes your host.
Jul 15 20:24:44 <zaeph>	Just try `:set hostname_in_titlebar false` in ranger.
Jul 15 20:24:54 <zaeph>	(You have to move the selection for it to refresh.)
Jul 15 20:25:26 <zaeph>	Oh, unless you meant the path to the visited folder.  You could always run something in /tmp/ if that bothers you.
Jul 15 20:27:26 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Ahhh, think  I have to update
Jul 15 20:27:45 <zaeph>	Moving the selection didn't work?
Jul 15 20:27:49 <ParallaxDenigrat>	I'm on 1.8.1 abd that doesn't seem to be an option.
Jul 15 20:28:09 <zaeph>	Let me try on my end.
Jul 15 20:28:37 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: A kludge I just came up with, modify a colorscheme to have identical fg/bg colors in `context.in_titlebar` and it won't be visible?
Jul 15 20:28:53 <zaeph>	Yeah, doesn't exist in 1.8.1.
Jul 15 20:29:27 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: But if I were you I'd probably just patch ranger so you can censor the user@host, setting it arbitrarily.
Jul 15 20:29:27 <ParallaxDenigrat>	__monty__ that's a great idea!
Jul 15 20:29:54 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Honestly patching it is probably my plan, just wanted to check.
Jul 15 20:29:57 <ParallaxDenigrat>	Thanks for the help!
Jul 15 20:30:09 <zaeph>	Any time!
Jul 15 20:30:41 <__monty__>	ParallaxDenigrat: Oh, ha. Better yet.
Jul 15 20:38:06 <__monty__>	map <alt>i eval self.fm.username='¯\\_('; self.fm.hostname='_@)_/¯'; self.fm.redraw_window()
Jul 15 20:38:25 <__monty__>	Enter that exact string at the console, invoked with :, or put it in rc.conf
Jul 15 20:38:54 <__monty__>	Then press <alt>i (for "incognito") to see what happens : )

Oct 11 22:12:53 <vifon>	__monty__: I patched my CloudBot instance with proper s/// support.  It works seamlessly.  Would you be interested in applying this patch here?  (I would!)
Oct 11 22:13:14 <__monty__>	Sure.
Oct 11 22:13:24 <vifon>	I didn't replace the original code, just injected my additions there.
Oct 11 22:13:57 <vifon>	Patch: http://dpaste.com/3WBG49W
Oct 11 22:14:23 <vifon>	Uses https://gist.github.com/Vifon/0c91a8fd917b186f61c2c5388c6f9c9e , place it in the contrib directory of the main CloudBot directory.
Oct 11 22:15:26 <__monty__>	Wait, you just want s/// to be an alias for re///?
Oct 11 22:15:44 <vifon>	Well, yes.
Oct 11 22:16:17 <vifon>	Because, ugh!
Oct 11 22:16:49 <vifon>	I'm not sure what's the implementation of your re/// but this one should as robust as the original one.
Oct 11 22:18:34 <vifon>	(or as non-robust)

Oct 11 22:34:49 <vifon>	Exactly like this.
Oct 11 22:34:53 <vifon>	Did you apply the patch?
Oct 11 22:38:19 <__monty__>	No, just checking out the original code to see what's different.
Oct 11 22:38:52 <vifon>	The original doesn't even use regexps.
Oct 11 22:38:59 <vifon>	Or rather escapes them beforehand.
Oct 11 22:41:13 <__monty__>	It does though. And doesn't. Respectively.
Oct 11 22:41:25 <__monty__>	re/l(.*)i/\1
Oct 11 22:41:26 <RoboBob>	Correction, <__monty__> No, just checking out the origina code to see what's dfferent.

Oct 11 22:57:22 <vifon>	Well, a parser for the s/// expressions.
Oct 11 22:58:06 <__monty__>	How does it differ from what's in cloudbot? Looks so similar.
Oct 11 22:58:48 <vifon>	For one, it extracts the flags and translates them to a form edible for Python's re module.
Oct 11 22:59:41 <__monty__>	Cloudbot already does i,g and x though.
Oct 11 22:59:56 <vifon>	No, it just eats it up.
Oct 11 23:00:05 <vifon>	It doesn't interpret them.
Oct 11 23:02:16 <__monty__>	I'm basically sure re// is already your sedophile code >.<
Oct 11 23:02:28 <vifon>	Yes, I think so.
Oct 11 23:02:57 <vifon>	But back then I didn't convince you to make s/// use it. :>
Oct 11 23:03:28 <__monty__>	Well, I don't know why s// doesn't work yet. Keep getting key errors when it tries to retrieve history for '#ranger'
Oct 11 23:03:58 <__monty__>	Note that I reserve the right to replace s// with actual sed/vim whenever.
Oct 11 23:04:28 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Oct 11 23:04:31 <vifon>	Hereby I grant you this right.
Oct 11 23:40:46 <ublawiz>	You left them alone in a room with a penguin?! Mr Gates, your men are already dead.

Oct 19 22:00:46 <__monty__>	Has the file been committed?
Oct 19 22:03:56 <aRkedos>	yes
Oct 19 22:04:50 <aRkedos>	and I have a binding in VIM to remove that stuff
Oct 19 22:15:40 <aRkedos>	well maybe I make a new fork :/
Oct 19 22:15:54 <__monty__>	Shouldn't be necessary.
Oct 19 22:16:05 <aRkedos>	yeah but seems easier to me ^^
Oct 19 22:19:14 <__monty__>	It's actually a valuable learning experience to do it the right way though. Btw, `:set list` in vim will show you whitespace characters.
Oct 19 22:19:50 <__monty__>	Oh, but I think it doesn't do spaces by default. Check the vim wiki for how to do that though.
Oct 19 22:20:12 <__monty__>	nn, peoples
Oct 19 22:25:10 <aRkedos>	ah thanks __monty__
Oct 20 00:18:50 <Boobuigi>	Thank goodness for idle_delay.  Without it set, ranger (even when its terminal window was not even visible) was using 5~7% CPU on my Raspberry Pi.
Oct 20 00:20:58 <Boobuigi>	Anyone thought about setting that by default?  I think the default is 1 millisecond, but the default rc.conf has it set to 2000?!
Oct 20 00:21:31 *	Boobuigi is happy with 200 for now.
Oct 20 00:34:28 <vifon>	Boobuigi: Wait, so what's wrong with it being 2000 by default?
Oct 20 00:36:34 <Boobuigi>	Isn't that a two-second delay?  Maybe I'm confused.
Oct 20 00:37:35 <Boobuigi>	OK, maybe not.  I just tested it.
Oct 20 00:38:25 <Boobuigi>	Reading documentation, I figured it was the equivalent of calling sleep 2.000 in the main loop.
Oct 20 00:39:13 <aRkedos>	vifon is it possible to somehow extract the signal_name attribute within a function bound to a signal?
Oct 20 00:39:18 <Boobuigi>	I just set it to 20000, though (expecting up to twenty-second input lag), but there was no lag at all.
Oct 20 00:39:44 <vifon>	Boobuigi: I think it's about directory refresh.
Oct 20 00:40:12 <vifon>	aRkedos: It was a few years since I worked directly with our signals, let me see…
Oct 20 00:43:34 <vifon>	aRkedos: Did you try using the pass_signal parameter?
Oct 20 00:43:55 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L267
Oct 20 00:44:10 <vifon>	It seems when it's set, your handler gets the signal object passed.
Oct 20 00:50:06 <aRkedos>	well I only work with an Instance of Signal which has no such attribute, I am still trying to merge my 2 methods for toggling the status and titlebar into one, but for that need to pass the respective widget object
Oct 20 00:50:27 <aRkedos>	thing is that if you bind a signal to that method the signal itselfs gets passed onto that function
Oct 20 00:50:35 <aRkedos>	so you cant pass the widget object
Oct 20 00:51:11 <Boobuigi>	vifon: Ah, that's all it applies to?  Thanks for the clarification.
Oct 20 00:59:47 <vifon>	aRkedos: OK, I see now…  When you pass a function that takes any arguments, it gets enabled automatically.
Oct 20 00:59:56 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L142
Oct 20 01:00:00 <vifon>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L151
Oct 20 01:00:10 <vifon>	As for passing additional data…
Oct 20 01:00:30 <vifon>	Since you're new, I'm hesitant to suggest it, but closures could help here.
Oct 20 01:00:39 <vifon>	But it's a tricky concept for some.
Oct 20 01:01:32 <vifon>	aRkedos: Basically the function you bind there would be:
Oct 20 01:01:35 <vifon>	   lambda sig: do_something(sig, widget)
Oct 20 01:01:49 <vifon>	Or a named equivalent (even better).

Nov 07 14:21:37 <vifon>	I know of no full public logging over here.

Nov 07 14:21:54 <vifon>	Luyin: It's in the channel topic.

Nov 07 14:23:06 <Luyin>	IRC is not a suitable medium for privacy
Nov 07 14:23:21 <Luyin>	matrix.org I think can provide that, and is the most similar to IRC
Nov 07 14:23:45 <vifon>	We use it at work. It's ok.
Nov 07 14:23:52 <Luyin>	vifon: really?
Nov 07 14:24:03 <Luyin>	I guess private network? :)
Nov 07 14:24:09 <vifon>	Yeah, for 2 years or so already.

Nov 07 14:24:50 <Luyin>	we use mattermost. I really like that. if only people understood the reply button
Nov 07 14:25:24 <vifon>	We migrated from Mattermost after a yet another outage.
Nov 07 14:25:42 <vifon>	I don't remember what went wrong right now.
Nov 07 14:26:22 <Luyin>	 vifon spoke a total of 278476 words!
Nov 07 14:26:24 <Luyin>	vifon's faithful follower, __monty__, didn't speak so much: 271368 words.

Nov 07 14:26:29 <Luyin>	the stats are great
Nov 07 14:26:32 <Luyin>	useless but great
Nov 07 14:28:33 <__monty__>	Still, people *expect* privacy from queries.

Nov 07 22:05:33 <__monty__>	Really?
Nov 07 22:05:48 <__monty__>	Are you sure you're on the right branch?
Nov 07 22:05:54 <__monty__>	What's the commit?
Nov 07 22:06:11 <__monty__>	7aafd6?
Nov 07 22:06:14 <zaeph>	Uh, now it works.  Weird.
Nov 07 22:06:25 <zaeph>	Or wait, maybe I went back to master.
Nov 07 22:06:29 <__monty__>	: s
Nov 07 22:06:37 <__monty__>	This is getting more and more confusing!
Nov 07 22:07:07 <zaeph>	All right, so now I can launch it.  Not sure where the problem was.
Nov 07 22:09:49 <zaeph>	'bla' wasn't deleted.
Nov 07 22:10:10 <zaeph>	And no 'foo' as a file anymore.
Nov 07 22:13:13 <__monty__>	And the message at the bottom telling you you're doing it wrong?
Nov 07 22:14:59 <zaeph>	__monty__: 'Failed to paste.  The destination is invalid.'
Nov 07 22:15:09 <__monty__>	Sweet.
Nov 07 22:19:04 <Pepe_vulgaris>	ranger just blew my mind
Nov 07 22:19:43 <Pepe_vulgaris>	:rename dir/subdir renames olddir to dir and moves everything in it to a new subdir called subdir
Nov 07 22:20:43 <__monty__>	That's mkdir -p for you : )
Nov 07 22:21:36 <Pepe_vulgaris>	mkdir does not move contents, also a simple mv won't take care about the possible dotfiles
Nov 07 22:34:11 <__monty__>	Possible dotfiles?
Nov 07 22:34:47 <__monty__>	No, I meant we fairly recently added `-p` to `:bulkrename`'s functioning.
Nov 07 22:35:25 <__monty__>	So we create the target dir first, no matter how many dirs in between don't exist yet. Then we mv.
Nov 07 22:35:29 <zaeph>	I'm off, sleep tight folks!
Nov 07 22:36:42 <__monty__>	nn, zaeph, thanks for confirming it works! Another one down.
Nov 07 22:36:52 <zaeph>	Any time. ;)

Feb 19 13:57:55 <watered>	vifon: I accidentally deleted all .files in my home directory
Feb 19 13:57:56 <watered>	but before it could be deleted I quit
Feb 19 13:58:10 <watered>	Now it shows the space freed up on df and i3-statusbar
Feb 19 13:58:11 <watered>	But the files are still there
Feb 19 13:58:18 <watered>	They are accessible
Feb 19 13:58:29 <watered>	How is that possible
Feb 19 13:58:52 <watered>	I'm scared they are marked for delete on next reboot or will be overwritten during new file transfers
Feb 19 13:59:25 <vifon>	Ranger probably started with one of the first directories there and didn't finish.
Feb 19 13:59:42 <vifon>	It probably deleted some files, just not all of them.
Feb 19 13:59:56 <vifon>	Do you have any backups?
Feb 19 14:00:50 <vifon>	If not, shutdown the system NOW, boot up some system from live USB and try tools like PhotoRec.
Feb 19 14:01:26 <watered>	vifon: But is it possible for such a thing to happen?
Feb 19 14:02:56 <vifon>	watered: Definitely.  Ranger cannot delete everything at once.  It goes file by file.
Feb 19 14:03:13 <watered>	vifon: But does it use the rm command?
Feb 19 14:03:23 <vifon>	Probably the unlink syscall.
Feb 19 14:03:24 <watered>	Everything I want seems to be there
Feb 19 14:03:48 <watered>	What is the actual name? 'unlink syscall'?
Feb 19 14:04:02 <watered>	is it possible to reverse that without rebooting?
Feb 19 14:04:22 <watered>	I'm worried if I reboot it will all go
Feb 19 14:04:24 <vifon>	Well, you can think about it as the rm command, yes.
Feb 19 14:05:05 <vifon>	watered: Rebooting won't make it worse than it is.
Feb 19 14:09:01 <watered>	vifon: I can see the files now and open them...! What if the link is in ram that's why I can still see them?
Feb 19 14:17:18 <vifon>	watered: Not possible.
Feb 19 14:18:07 <vifon>	The removed files that are still open are no longer visible.
Feb 19 14:18:08 <vifon>	The files you can see are fine.

Feb 28 22:58:46 <grobi>	good night, rangers 😲
Feb 28 23:03:24 <__monty__>	nn, grobi 
Feb 28 23:25:04 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Feb 28 23:41:20 <maerwald>	Since ranger is writte in python... I assume it handles filepaths as utf-8 and not bytestring on unix?
Feb 28 23:41:55 <__monty__>	It's messy.
Feb 28 23:42:45 <__monty__>	Fwiw I haven't run into issues with that yet though.
Feb 28 23:43:03 <maerwald>	Well, the one thing a filemanager should get right is handling filepaths :P
Feb 28 23:43:19 <__monty__>	And it does. I'm just always surprised it does.
Feb 28 23:43:27 <maerwald>	I was looking at hunter (written in rust), but it seems buggy
Feb 28 23:43:47 <__monty__>	You should give ranger a shot before you knock it.
Feb 28 23:43:49 <maerwald>	Though rusts OsString should be sorta safe, although it makes no effort to not have developers convert to and from utf-8 randomly
Feb 28 23:44:46 <__monty__>	Pretending filenames are utf-8 doesn't really do any harm if it's just for presentation.
Feb 28 23:45:08 <maerwald>	yeah, but it's likely they are shoe-horned that way into the syscalls
Feb 28 23:45:56 <__monty__>	Not sure what you suspect might go wrong? If you pass the bits unaltered there's no problem.
Feb 28 23:46:21 <__monty__>	I dare you to find bugs related to the handling of filenames in ranger.
Feb 28 23:46:30 <maerwald>	I mean, once they were converted to utf-8, the information of the original encoding is lost and it is pure luck whether passing it to a syscall does what you think
Feb 28 23:46:35 <__monty__>	Either we get a satisfied user or we get a good bug report : )
Feb 28 23:46:49 <__monty__>	There's no converting.
Feb 28 23:47:03 <__monty__>	You try to read random bytes as if they're utf-8.
Feb 28 23:47:06 <maerwald>	that was my question... are they kept as bytes or utf-8
Feb 28 23:47:27 <__monty__>	They're kept as strings for the UI.
Feb 28 23:47:49 <__monty__>	To date I've only had to fix a single bug because of this and it had nothing to do with syscalls.
Feb 28 23:48:16 <__monty__>	Seriously, give it a spin, you might be pleasantly surprised.

Feb 29 15:18:57 <maerwald>	It's heavily inspired by ranger
Feb 29 15:23:18 <__monty__>	Hmm, vifon, did we ever agree on listing alternatives? I think we talked about listing them in the README, I know we have a wiki section.
Feb 29 15:35:28 <vifon>	__monty__: I don't recall.
Feb 29 17:40:41 <Elodin>	__monty__: thanks
Feb 29 17:41:02 <__monty__>	Elodin: np
Feb 29 17:41:58 <Elodin>	i tried vifm, however one thing i really like about ranger is the open with capability where we can set multiple ways to open things and leave it there
Feb 29 17:45:28 <__monty__>	You could use rifle with vifm. Not sure how hard it'd be to implement a bit of integration to show options.

Mar 18 17:44:03 <eggbean>	How do I run ranger once it has been installed using pip?
Mar 18 17:46:05 <__monty__>	eggbean: Just invoked `ranger` on the command line.
Mar 18 17:46:21 <__monty__>	Make sure you installed ranger-fm, not ranger.
Mar 18 17:46:58 <eggbean>	$ pip install ranger-fm
Mar 18 17:47:07 <eggbean>	$ ranger
Mar 18 17:47:09 <eggbean>	-bash: ranger: command not found
Mar 18 17:47:12 <eggbean>	__monty__: ?
Mar 18 17:48:27 <__monty__>	check whether there's a ranger script in ~/.local/bin
Mar 18 17:49:08 <eggbean>	yes, it's there
Mar 18 17:49:47 <eggbean>	I can run it from there. A problem with my $PATH probably?
Mar 18 17:49:57 <__monty__>	Is ~/.local/bin in your PATH?
Mar 18 17:50:01 <__monty__>	Yeah, probably.
Mar 18 17:50:30 <__monty__>	Welcome btw, hope you like ranger!

Mar 18 17:52:52 <eggbean>	In article about ranger spookily appeared on my suggested links in the google app, after asking if anybody knew of a tool like this on ##linux last night

Mar 20 12:14:39 <zaeph>	Pro-tip: Spring cleaning is also the perfect opportunity to diff master's rifle.conf & scope.sh to make sure that your personal files is up to dateger
Mar 20 12:14:42 <zaeph>	Whoops.
Mar 20 12:15:11 <zaeph>	Opened a terminal, lost focus on the chat, and then pressed enter. -.-
Mar 20 12:16:18 <zaeph>	But yeah, as I was writing it, I wondered whether the system's rifle.conf and scope.sh get loaded in their entirety if you have a personal file in your ~.  Pretty sure there was a setting for this.
Mar 20 12:16:44 <__monty__>	Nope
Mar 20 12:16:51 <zaeph>	Wasn't it RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=FALSE ?
Mar 20 12:16:58 <__monty__>	Scope file is configured in rc.conf.
Mar 20 12:17:18 <__monty__>	Rifle can only read a single config because it's too hard with the precedence rules.
Mar 20 12:17:28 <__monty__>	That's only for rc.conf.
Mar 20 12:17:40 <zaeph>	Oh, right.  Thanks for clarifying.
Mar 20 12:17:42 <__monty__>	And the _RC suffix should point out : )
Mar 20 12:17:47 <__monty__>	*As
Mar 20 12:19:24 <zaeph>	It's been a while since I've last modified my rc.conf, and I assumed that 'rc' was including rifle.conf and scope.sh rather than *just* ranger's config.
Mar 20 12:19:40 <zaeph>	At any rate, my original point stand: good time to diff/merge. :p
Mar 20 12:20:20 <__monty__>	Weird assumption.
Mar 20 12:20:33 <__monty__>	That's not how rc files work. Which is what rc.conf is based on.
Mar 20 12:22:08 <zaeph>	It's because it completely flew over my head that rc.conf worked like a traditional rc-file.  I just assumed that it stood for 'ranger config'.
Mar 20 12:22:30 <zaeph>	The logic's pretty unsound on that one, don't try to salvage it. :o)
Mar 20 12:23:10 <__monty__>	RangerConfig.conf >.<
Mar 20 12:24:26 <zaeph>	Who cares about rc files when you can have an init.el. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 20 12:27:02 <__monty__>	Sounds a lot like an rc file ; p

Mar 20 14:57:04 <zaeph>	Always hate debugging race conditions.
Mar 20 14:57:58 <zaeph>	Traced it down to a program that forks to the background without providing any means to get the PID.
Mar 20 15:01:00 <zaeph>	Basically, I'm generating a screenshot for i3lock to use, and after running i3lock, I need to run two other functions *whilst* i3lock is running, one of which is a cleanup for the screenshot.
Mar 20 15:01:40 <zaeph>	I could just make i3lock not fork to the background, but I need the other function (the one which isn't a cleanup) to run after i3lock has been started.  Such a mess.
Mar 20 15:02:48 <zaeph>	Maybe I could get it to run before the lock.  Uhm...  O'boy, here I go coding again!
Mar 20 15:06:05 <__monty__>	Weird, returning the child's PID is literally what fork does.
Mar 20 15:09:17 <zaeph>	Yeah.  Well, since I'm safeguarding against running concurrent versions of i3lock, I can just pgrep the pid right after running it, but it isn't Beautiful™.
Mar 20 15:10:00 <__monty__>	How are you forking that you can't get the pid though?
Mar 20 15:10:24 <zaeph>	i3lock's default behaviour is to fork without giving you the PID.
Mar 20 15:10:40 <zaeph>	There's an option to have it not-fork, in which case you can bg it and retrieve the PID as you would normally with $!.
Mar 20 15:12:40 <zaeph>	But the problem is that it's a script meant to be run automatically on suspend with systemd, so I can't have it stay alive during--
Mar 20 15:12:49 <zaeph>	OK, I'll bottomline it: it's a clusterfuck.
Mar 20 15:13:45 <zaeph>	All I wanted is to have the same script be used for manual and automatic suspend when closing the lid. -.-
Mar 20 15:15:59 <zaeph>	But it works, so I won't complain too much.
Mar 20 15:18:34 <__monty__>	Can't you simply fork the non-forking version of i3lock?
Mar 20 15:18:57 <__monty__>	I.e., call `fork i3lock`.
Mar 20 15:20:28 <zaeph>	I could, but I also wanted my script to handle the clean-up (like removing the screenshot), but for that, the script needs to track the status of the i3lock process, which hangs systemd's suspend.
Mar 20 15:21:15 <zaeph>	The right way to do it would be to have a resume script handle the cleanup, but I can't be arsed passing all files that instructions to another process, like the path to the screenshot and all that.
Mar 20 15:21:53 <__monty__>	And why don't you just write a systemd service and invoke it manually with systemctl suspend?
Mar 20 15:23:08 <zaeph>	Because I use a wrapper around 'systemctl suspend' to allow me to cancel it if I don't want to suspend after all, and which makes heavy use of dunst's notifications.
Mar 20 15:24:15 <zaeph>	This whole lock-suspend procedure is one of the earliest thing I've wrote on that computer, and it's become quite complex.  It went through revisions to streamline the interactions, but in cases like this, it's pretty rough.
Mar 20 15:24:47 <__monty__>	How about the service starting a timer that triggers the actual service?
Mar 20 15:25:33 <zaeph>	And making it cancellable?  Could work.  I'd just have to isolate the cancelling element of the main locking script.
Mar 20 15:26:07 <__monty__>	Well cancelling would just be stopping the timer.
Mar 20 15:26:17 <zaeph>	It's actually the main problem: it's the script itself that handles the cancellation, not a wrapper.  It's done fairly reliably with PIDs, though.
Mar 20 15:26:34 <zaeph>	Yeah, I guess it could work like this. :)
Mar 20 15:26:46 <__monty__>	Wow, just listened to Cage's Four Minutes, Thirty-three Seconds, :') so moving.
Mar 20 15:30:26 <zaeph>	That's… interesting.

Apr 02 10:16:42 <zaeph>	Hello there!  Can anyone reproduce a crash on launch with `set max_console_history_size none` in rc.conf?
Apr 02 10:17:56 <zaeph>	Seems to be a problem with the parsing of the 'none'.  Here's the traceback: https://paste.xinu.at/CfpH/plain
Apr 02 10:18:26 <zaeph>	And setting it to 'none' from inside ranger doesn't raise an error.
Apr 02 10:22:36 <__monty__>	zaeph: Well, the error tells you that's not a valid value.
Apr 02 10:22:59 <zaeph>	You're not a valid value!
Apr 02 10:23:23 <zaeph>	From man: https://paste.xinu.at/gqrxIX/plain
Apr 02 10:23:50 <zaeph>	Tried a quoted "none" as well, didn't work.
Apr 02 10:26:14 <__monty__>	Well, the manual's lying.
Apr 02 10:26:45 <__monty__>	Hmm, though the assert shouldn't trigger if you're running a packaged version of ranger
Apr 02 10:26:59 <__monty__>	It'd still break, just not at that point.
Apr 02 10:27:11 <__monty__>	Open an issue so we don't forget to fix this.
Apr 02 10:27:15 <zaeph>	Tried with my fork as well, although I used my own rc.conf.
Apr 02 10:27:27 <zaeph>	I'll do that tonight, got a busy afternoon.

Apr 03 12:34:50 <raphaelpierre>	help
Apr 03 12:34:56 <zaeph>	No.
Apr 03 12:35:05 <zaeph>	…But do go on.
Apr 03 12:35:08 <raphaelpierre>	:) sorry bad window
Apr 03 12:35:18 <raphaelpierre>	thanks
Apr 03 12:35:21 <zaeph>	You got me all excited for nothing. :(
Apr 03 12:35:34 <zaeph>	Back to torpor, then.
Apr 03 13:48:45 <mahe>	hi rangers! can somebody who's familiar with the code please help me get started with a modification: where does ranger interpret single keypresses (as defined via 'map' commands) in the main view?
Apr 03 13:49:58 <__monty__>	Maybe tell us what you want to achieve first. To avoid XY.
Apr 03 13:51:27 <mahe>	I want to try masking those 'map' keybindings behind a different mode (that has to be toggled), so that I can implement a true type-ahead (aka search-as-you-type) default behavior for navigation. As the 'find' and 'scout' commands sadly don't cut it for me.
Apr 03 13:52:06 <zaeph>	Have you tried our lord and saviour `map f chain move to=0;console scout -efit%space`?
Apr 03 13:53:00 <zaeph>	And have you looked at the different options for scout?  There's plenty of room for customisation.
Apr 03 13:54:41 <__monty__>	mahe: Have you tried :travel?
Apr 03 13:55:31 <__monty__>	And yeah, scout is pretty flexible, make sure it doesn't satisfy your needs.
Apr 03 13:57:01 <mahe>	I tried travel and some options for scout but my problem is: I want to select files/folders by typing per default. When I open ranger, when I enter a folder etc. I don't wanna leave this navigation mode until I explicitly leave this mode. Also I want arrow keys to still work while in type-ahead mode etc.
Apr 03 13:57:31 <__monty__>	Ok, sounds like a cool mode.
Apr 03 13:57:36 <mahe>	similar to how midnight commander works when you disable its command bar per default
Apr 03 13:57:46 <zaeph>	So, you want a scout which, upon entering a new folder, fires up scout again as long as the mode is toggled?
Apr 03 13:57:51 <zaeph>	I agree, that sounds pretty interesting.
Apr 03 13:57:54 <__monty__>	I'd look at the other modes first. Rather than key parsing.
Apr 03 13:57:54 <zaeph>	HERESY!
Apr 03 13:58:08 <zaeph>	He mentioned our arch-enemy!
Apr 03 13:58:11 <mahe>	a type-ahead mode that doesn't interfere with basic navigation and behavior basically
Apr 03 13:59:31 <mahe>	anyway, where in the code would I look for the key press interpretation in the normal view?
Apr 03 14:00:06 <mahe>	is it ui.py:handle_key() and ui.py:press() ?
Apr 03 14:00:25 <mahe>	*gui/ui.py
Apr 03 14:03:07 <zaeph>	mahe: It's beyond my expertise, and I can't look it up right now.  best of luck, though.
Apr 03 14:05:19 <__monty__>	I don't know either. Those sound promising though.

Apr 04 22:12:49 <zaeph>	Yeah, we had a 16yo without comorbidities who didn't make it here.
Apr 04 22:13:54 <zaeph>	Felt like an outlier until the next day where a 15yo developed pretty severe symptoms.  Might be anecdotal data, but it is upsetting.

Apr 04 23:48:42 <RoboBobob>	GermainZ: Regions of Ruin:Sieges on Steam
Apr 04 23:50:28 <GermainZ>	RoboBobob: thank you
Apr 04 23:53:17 <vifon>	GermainZ: And Risk of Rain 2 is free to play for this weekend.
Apr 04 23:53:30 <vifon>	Looks pretty good.  Literally RoR1 but in 3D.
Apr 04 23:53:32 <GermainZ>	vifon: oooh I might try that out. Plenty of work tomorrow tho.
Apr 04 23:53:35 <GermainZ>	I liked RoR1
Apr 04 23:53:38 <zaeph>	Loved RoR1.  Damn, that OST.
Apr 04 23:53:46 <GermainZ>	RoR2 runs on Linux?
Apr 04 23:53:58 <zaeph>	RoR2's OST is pretty damn good too.
Apr 04 23:54:05 <GermainZ>	just like your face
Apr 04 23:54:05 <vifon>	Let me see…
Apr 04 23:54:06 <vifon>	GermainZ: Nope.
Apr 04 23:54:11 <GermainZ>	Damn
Apr 04 23:54:34 <GermainZ>	https://www.protondb.com/app/632360 platinum on Proton tho
Apr 04 23:55:04 <vifon>	Wanna coop?
Apr 04 23:55:31 <GermainZ>	now?
Apr 04 23:55:42 <vifon>	As one of the options, yes.
Apr 04 23:55:47 <GermainZ>	Let's do it
Apr 04 23:55:49 <GermainZ>	I'm installing it
Apr 04 23:55:54 <vifon>	Hell yeah!
Apr 04 23:56:29 <GermainZ>	I was planning to sleep but sleep can wait!
Apr 04 23:56:52 <vifon>	zaeph: Do I remember correctly you don't have any gaming-grade hardware? :(
Apr 04 23:57:02 <GermainZ>	RoR2 runs on potatoes tho
Apr 04 23:57:24 <GermainZ>	No?
Apr 04 23:57:30 <vifon>	No idea, TBH.
Apr 04 23:57:37 <GermainZ>	Well let's hope so
Apr 04 23:57:41 <vifon>	And potato hardware can mean many things.
Apr 04 23:57:45 <GermainZ>	Cos I can't restart the session to use my eGPU right now
Apr 04 23:57:53 <GermainZ>	So my potato GPU will have to do
Apr 04 23:58:15 <vifon>	My usual laptop is pretty fine but it has only the Intel GPU and after all the security patches CPU isn't that performant either.
Apr 04 23:58:21 <GermainZ>	I disabled those
Apr 04 23:58:31 <vifon>	So at this point just don't game on it at all.
Apr 04 23:58:59 <vifon>	Though 4 years ago I was gaming on it for a month.  Felt beefier back then.
Apr 04 23:59:04 <zaeph>	vifon: Nah, I dont, but I'm saving up.  It's getting late anyway, and I'll be off once I've finished processing a batch of book I've downloaded.
Apr 05 00:00:42 <vifon>	GermainZ: Do my invites reach you?
Apr 05 00:01:05 <GermainZ>	vifon: yes hold on configuring graphics
Apr 05 00:01:10 <vifon>	Ah, sure.
Apr 05 00:02:33 <GermainZ>	11 FPS is the best I can do D:
Apr 05 00:02:44 <vifon>	Damn.
Apr 05 00:02:47 <GermainZ>	vifon: gimme 5 minutes
Apr 05 00:02:51 <GermainZ>	let me save some stuff and connect the eGPU
Apr 05 00:02:59 <vifon>	Fancy.
Apr 05 00:08:43 <GermainZ>	vifon: alright
Apr 05 00:09:19 <vifon>	How many FPS?
Apr 05 00:09:57 <GermainZ>	vifon: plenty
Apr 05 00:53:03 <GermainZ>	fun game
Apr 05 00:53:08 <GermainZ>	I should get more used to the Steam Controller
Apr 05 00:53:13 <vifon>	Pretty good, though I'd rather not buy it at this price point.
Apr 05 00:53:20 <GermainZ>	yup
Apr 05 00:53:24 <GermainZ>	I've got plenty of games for now :D
Apr 05 00:53:24 <vifon>	SC is great when it works.
Apr 05 00:53:40 <vifon>	Sekiro on SC is awesome.  I cannot play it without the paddles at this point.
Apr 05 00:54:46 <vifon>	Huh.  I had Synergy running on my laptop the whole time.  Good to know it doesn't mess with the games as much as it used to.
Apr 05 00:55:03 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 05 00:56:38 <vifon>	In a roundabout way, RoR2 reminded me I wanted to play Void Bastards more. :)
Apr 05 00:57:19 <vifon>	VB is like a roguelite System Shock 2.  Of course not remotely as good as System Shock 2 but you get the idea.
Apr 05 00:57:30 <GermainZ>	Not really
Apr 05 00:57:35 <GermainZ>	I haven't played either :D
Apr 05 00:58:09 <vifon>	Play SS2, it's timeless.
Apr 05 00:58:34 <GermainZ>	I will at one point!
Apr 05 00:58:37 <GermainZ>	But who knows when
Apr 05 00:58:40 <GermainZ>	So many games to play
Apr 05 00:58:43 <vifon>	True.

Apr 10 19:06:50 <vifon>	Bobob doesn't have it implemented yet.

Apr 10 19:07:03 <__monty__>	Guess I was just imagining things.
Apr 10 19:07:09 <__monty__>	I'd run Bob in parallel.
Apr 10 19:07:17 <__monty__>	But that'd involve fixing python.
Apr 10 19:07:21 <vifon>	Works for me.
Apr 10 19:07:26 <__monty__>	Oh, I guess I could just run it with python2.
Apr 10 19:07:33 <__monty__>	 /facepalm

Apr 10 20:46:39 <zaeph>	Oh no.
Apr 10 20:46:53 <zaeph>	Now my evil mind is thinking how I can exploit that.
Apr 10 20:46:55 <__monty__>	vifon: Could you add Bob to Bobob's ignores? : )
Apr 10 20:47:05 <zaeph>	I can put them in resonance!

Apr 10 22:19:34 <__monty__>	Oh.
Apr 10 22:19:47 <vifon>	But I actually already have an exception for *that friend*.
Apr 10 22:19:51 <vifon>	Do you remember?
Apr 10 22:19:56 <vifon>	I'll add Bob too then.

Apr 10 22:20:43 <vifon>	Do you remember how I was patching my bot at FOSDEM?
Apr 10 22:20:52 <vifon>	Because my friend was in a pentesting mood.
Apr 10 22:20:57 <__monty__>	Yeah, ah.
Apr 10 22:21:27 <__monty__>	So you made it secure but only from them? : D
Apr 10 22:21:42 <vifon>	Nah.  I made it secure but he kept trying to find something more.
Apr 10 22:21:57 <vifon>	He didn't but it was enough to increase the load of my server to the annoying levels.
Apr 10 22:22:19 <vifon>	But he still admitted it's secure.  That's quite something in his case.
Apr 10 22:23:07 <zaeph>	Also, which one of you's CaptainRanger or CaptRanger.

Apr 10 22:41:56 <__monty__>	Cool.
Apr 10 22:42:04 <__monty__>	Not that being a maintainer is all that glorious...
Apr 10 22:42:29 <zaeph>	I'd get a cool tag next to my name in that repo!  Worth it.
Apr 10 22:44:00 <dice>	hello, trying to change directory using a string that's being collected by a shell script
Apr 10 22:44:17 <dice>	however bash cd does work with ranger
Apr 10 22:44:24 <dice>	is there a workaround?
Apr 10 22:44:42 <zaeph>	dice: `:cd` doesn't work?
Apr 10 22:44:52 <dice>	opps** I meant :shell cd
Apr 10 22:44:56 <dice>	doesn't work
Apr 10 22:45:48 <zaeph>	Does the `cd` happen at the beginning of the script?
Apr 10 22:45:57 <dice>	my code is `:shell i=$(cmus-remote -C status | grep file | sed "s/file //" | sed 's,[^/]*$,,');cd "$i"`
Apr 10 22:46:36 <dice>	no it happens at the end after I've collected the dir I want to change to
Apr 10 22:47:09 <zaeph>	I'm not sure if you can forward an instruction via `:shell` to change ranger's directory.
Apr 10 22:47:29 <__monty__>	Nope, you can't.
Apr 10 22:47:34 <dice>	well that would break my code
Apr 10 22:47:37 <__monty__>	That cd would affect the subshell.
Apr 10 22:47:48 <zaeph>	__monty__: Can we `:cd` into a computed value?
Apr 10 22:47:52 <__monty__>	Which is cleaned up right after the cd finished.
Apr 10 22:48:18 <__monty__>	Only with a custom command I think.
Apr 10 22:48:30 <zaeph>	Uhm.  I'm finishing a PR on my end, I'll have a look after.
Apr 10 22:48:36 <dice>	woooshhhh ... right over my head
Apr 10 22:51:34 <__monty__>	Oh, actually. You can use `:eval self.fm.cd('some/dir')`
Apr 10 22:51:49 <__monty__>	So either rewrite your script as python.
Apr 10 22:52:03 <__monty__>	Or write some python that executes the shell script.
Apr 10 22:57:18 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Apr 10 22:57:21 <zaeph>	B-bye!
Apr 10 22:57:39 <dice>	ok bye that's a start
Apr 10 22:58:03 <zaeph>	I'll be with you in 5', but I'm not very good with Python.
Apr 10 22:58:15 <dice>	sounds good:)
Apr 10 23:40:53 <zaeph>	dice: Whoops, sorry, I got carried away. -.-
Apr 10 23:42:35 <dice>	no problem this one gonna take me awhile! i'm no so keen on python code either
Apr 10 23:43:08 <zaeph>	It's a one-liner, so it shouldn't be too tough to figure out.  What have you got so far?
Apr 10 23:46:03 <dice>	oh it's bad! something like import subprocess
Apr 10 23:46:06 <dice>	output = subprocess.Popen([ 'cmus-remote', '-C', 'status', '|', 'grep', 'file', '|', 'sed', "s/file //", '|', 'sed', 's,[^/]*$,,' ],
Apr 10 23:46:08 <dice>	        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
Apr 10 23:46:12 <dice>	        stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
Apr 10 23:46:35 <zaeph>	Oof, that Popen line doesn't look too good indeed.
Apr 10 23:46:49 <zaeph>	vifon: Do you have any quick idea on how to help ^?
Apr 10 23:47:19 <vifon>	Definitely replace it with subprocess.check_output()
Apr 10 23:47:37 <vifon>	Wait wait wait.
Apr 10 23:47:48 <vifon>	You cannot use pipes like this without a shell.
Apr 10 23:48:09 <vifon>	If you insist, pass shell=True to check_output/Popen and put all your arguments into a single string.
Apr 10 23:48:48 <vifon>	I would just call "cmus-remote -C status" without the shell and then process the rest of it in Python.
Apr 10 23:49:13 <dice>	kind like output = subprocess.check_output(cmus-remote -C status | grep file | sed "s/file //" | sed 's,[^/]*$,,', shell=True)
Apr 10 23:52:51 <dice>	the shear amount of redirection
Apr 10 23:53:25 <dice>	@vifon: thx for the help:)
Apr 10 23:55:09 <vifon>	Did it work?

Apr 11 00:11:48 <dice>	haha not yet... well the part that you helped me with works
Apr 11 00:12:15 <dice>	having trouble using communicate() to get the my string printed
Apr 11 00:12:54 <dice>	it's an AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no object 'communicate'
Apr 11 00:14:18 <dice>	my code is stdout, stderr = out.communicate()
Apr 11 00:14:20 <dice>	print(stdout)
Apr 11 00:14:40 <dice>	wait!
Apr 11 00:17:09 <vifon>	dice: Use check_output, Popen is too low level for this.
Apr 11 00:23:49 <dice>	ahha yes I hadn't updated the print() part of my script to match the output_check
Apr 11 00:24:32 <dice>	the only problem I have now is that python print \b and \n around my string
Apr 11 00:24:45 <dice>	I don't think ranger is gonna like that
Apr 11 00:26:04 <zaeph>	(?) Ranger will remember that.
Apr 11 00:29:51 <vifon>	I see you've played the Telltale Games games too. :)
Apr 11 00:30:15 <zaeph>	Eh, I'm a man of culture.
Apr 11 00:30:31 <vifon>	First of all, use universal_newlines=True
Apr 11 00:30:39 <vifon>	This way you'll get a string and note bytes.
Apr 11 00:30:49 <vifon>	*not
Apr 11 00:30:49 <vifon>	dice: ↑
Apr 11 00:30:58 <vifon>	Then, consider calling strip() on the result.
Apr 11 00:31:36 <dice>	ah I see
Apr 11 00:44:11 <dice>	so on the one hand I have a python script that gives me the path I want to go to... and on the other hand I have :eval self.fm.cd('some/dir')
Apr 11 01:22:47 <dice>	map vs shell i=$(cmus-remote -C status | grep file | sed "s/file //" | sed 's,[^/]*$,,'); cd "$i"
Apr 11 01:32:56 <dice>	ok this is what I have so far: :eval -q import subprocess; out = subprocess.output_check( "cmus-remote -C status | grep file | sed 's/file //' | sed 's,[^/]*$,,'", shell=True, universal_newlines=True ); self.fm.cd(out)
Apr 11 01:33:53 <dice>	@vifon: clearly I'm missing something here
Apr 11 01:34:47 <vifon>	dice: You'd be better off writing it as a command in commands.py
Apr 11 01:34:55 <vifon>	Are you familiar with it?
Apr 11 01:35:31 <vifon>	Basically copy one of the simple existing ones, rename it and replace the execute() method with your code.
Apr 11 01:36:00 <dice>	mmmm seems straightforward 
Apr 11 01:36:24 <dice>	I'll give it a shott

Apr 11 13:03:47 <zaeph>	You mean the article on slip-box/zettelkästen?
Apr 11 13:03:51 <__monty__>	ldlework claims to be working on something similar based on org-brain.
Apr 11 13:03:55 <__monty__>	Yeah.
Apr 11 13:04:10 <zaeph>	Man, why is the topic so en vogue right now?  Have I missed something?
Apr 11 13:04:18 <__monty__>	I just have a book to finish before I get to that article >.<
Apr 11 13:04:31 <__monty__>	Because I mentioned that article and neuron.
Apr 11 13:04:40 <__monty__>	Don't you know I'm an *influencer*?!
Apr 11 13:04:48 <zaeph>	I'm almost done with Ahrens, How to Take Smart Notes!
Apr 11 13:05:05 <zaeph>	You clearly are, judging by the facts.
Apr 11 13:05:12 <zaeph>	I'll have a read soon, finishing a PR.
Apr 11 13:05:31 <zaeph>	…I'm gonna stop saying that, makes me sound pretentious.
Apr 11 13:05:43 <zaeph>	…Which I am, but one ought to dissimulate it, right?
Apr 11 13:10:06 <__monty__>	Nah, people being excited about foss contributions can excite others.
Apr 11 13:18:04 <zaeph>	All right, done with the PR.  Time to read.
Apr 11 13:18:12 <GermainZ>	I'm sorry vifon, I'm sorry __monty__ 
Apr 11 13:18:14 *	GermainZ commits seppuku
Apr 11 13:18:18 <zaeph>	RIP.
Apr 11 13:19:23 <__monty__>	GermainZ: You're grounded. Go to your room, mister!
Apr 11 13:19:43 *	__monty__ assumes an angry mom stance. Hands on hips, tapping foot and look of disapproval.
Apr 11 13:20:06 <zaeph>	ಠ_ಠ
Apr 11 13:20:09 <GermainZ>	can't go to my room if I'm dead!
Apr 11 13:20:18 <zaeph>	#existentialism
Apr 11 13:33:51 <zaeph>	__monty__: I've read about a third of the post you've linked.  Interesting idea about the fact that knowledge management system would need constant improvement in the syntax for representing new approaches to knowledge.
Apr 11 13:34:27 <zaeph>	i.e., for the sake of argument, creating a tag for delimiting irony in a note.
Apr 11 13:36:00 <zaeph>	But I'm not too sold on the idea.  A point that is made in Ahrens (2017) is that restrictions facilitates creativity, which is a little counterintuitive.  It's the usual argument that you have to think inside the box before thinking outside of it.
Apr 11 13:37:29 <zaeph>	The author also makes the point that you should have a minimal set of 'tags' (to reuse the GH's post terminology) and stick to it.  Links between ideas/notes are essential in the slip-box system, and that's pretty much the only thing you need.
Apr 11 13:37:50 <zaeph>	So although I like the idea, I prefer the direction in which org-roam, the slip-box implementation I'm following, is going.
Apr 11 13:45:33 <__monty__>	I invited ldlework to come talk about it fyi.
Apr 11 13:46:09 <zaeph>	We're doomed!
Apr 11 13:47:12 <__monty__>	He might not join ; )
Apr 11 14:33:17 <zaeph>	Yay, filed my first issue on GitLab!
Apr 11 15:15:27 <zaeph>	Okay, Inkscape rent:
Apr 11 15:15:55 <zaeph>	Why can I only define the center of gravity when skewing and rotating, and not when I'm scaling?  Also, why does setting the point of gravity in skewing mode activates it for scaling mode?
Apr 11 15:16:03 <zaeph>	(I obviously meant rant*.)
Apr 11 15:16:05 <zaeph>	/rant
Apr 11 15:30:42 <zaeph>	Man, ranger's filters are great.  Haven't used them much before, but they're proving particularly useful today.
Apr 11 15:34:31 <__monty__>	The filter stack?
Apr 11 15:34:41 <zaeph>	Whatever's accessed via zf.
Apr 11 15:34:45 <__monty__>	It's cool and you should use it rather than the legacy filters.
Apr 11 15:34:48 <__monty__>	Ugh, gross!
Apr 11 15:34:55 <zaeph>	You're gross!
Apr 11 15:34:57 *	zaeph sulks.
Apr 11 15:35:09 <Thermoriax>	Filter cooties!
Apr 11 16:00:44 <zaeph>	Doesn't seem that ldlework accepted your invitation.
Apr 11 16:00:50 <zaeph>	Friendship ended with ldlework?
Apr 11 16:01:01 <zaeph>	(There might be an s, I don't remember.)
Apr 11 16:08:31 <__monty__>	I think he was still traumatized by his experiences here : )
Apr 11 16:30:34 <zaeph>	Why is it always so confusing to know whether to make a directory name singular or plural. -.-
Apr 11 16:30:47 <zaeph>	Like, 'refs' fill all well and good, it's abbreviated after all.
Apr 11 16:30:53 <zaeph>	But 'indexes'?  Plain ugly!
Apr 11 16:31:06 <zaeph>	'inds'?  Not even in your dreams!
Apr 11 16:31:13 <__monty__>	Probably because it's indices, not indexes, english major : P
Apr 11 16:31:14 <zaeph>	'index'?  Then it's not consistent.
Apr 11 16:31:27 <zaeph>	Oh I'm an idiot.
Apr 11 16:31:38 <zaeph>	I just got schooled. (๑°⌓°๑)
Apr 11 16:32:18 <__monty__>	zaeph: Book is also nice. book/Pride & Prejudice.epub
Apr 11 16:32:32 <__monty__>	I do plurals though.
Apr 11 16:32:57 <zaeph>	It's like with tags: should they be singular or plurals?  My folders are so inconsistent because of this.
Apr 11 16:33:06 <__monty__>	I'm pretty sure both plurals of index are valid btw. Just to be clear : )
Apr 11 16:33:27 <zaeph>	(They are, but they are preferences depending on the acception.  Checking the OED right now.)
Apr 11 16:33:45 <__monty__>	Thing with index is it seems to imply the directory *is* the index, rather than containing some.
Apr 11 16:34:17 <zaeph>	But is an index of indexes not an index itself?
Apr 11 16:34:42 <__monty__>	Clearly it's turtles all the way down -_-
Apr 11 16:34:55 <zaeph>	Yuuup.
Apr 11 16:37:55 <zaeph>	All right, just returned to my notes, and I got it wrong.  You only have *one* index for your slip-box, so no need to make a folder out of it.
Apr 11 16:38:01 <__monty__>	Hmm, lets take a page out of Linnaeus', Apid*ae*.
Apr 11 16:38:39 <zaeph>	I thought that 'subject notes' which are supposed to give an overview of a topic are still considered to be notes, which makes sense.  They're just higher-level, withut necessarily talking of hierarchy.
Apr 11 16:40:01 <zaeph>	That's such a nitpick, I'd never noticed Apidae/Apidea.
Apr 11 16:40:46 <zaeph>	Oh wait, I thought that was a thing, but that was just me mistyping it on my first Google search.
Apr 11 16:41:37 <zaeph>	And I got convinced by an article on researchgate.net which makes the mistake. -.-  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/28201482_Galleria_mellonella_Linnaeus_1758_lepidoptera_galleriinaepyralidae_parasito_de_Apis_mellifera_iberica_Linnaeus_Hymenoptera_Apidea
Apr 11 16:41:59 <zaeph>	inb4 you tell me 'that's how you spell it in $lang!'
Apr 11 16:48:07 <GermainZ>	zaeph: that's how you spell it in $lang
Apr 11 16:48:19 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Thanks for clarifying.
Apr 11 16:48:24 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you're welcome
Apr 11 16:49:27 <zaeph>	A random thought: You know me, I'm bad at committing to anything.  I'll style-over-substance myself into oblivion before I achieve anything significant in my life.  But:
Apr 11 16:50:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: committing is easy, it's a single command
Apr 11 16:50:23 <zaeph>	I like working on my org-mode/Emacs setup.  And I've gotten to the point where, even though I'm afraid of stuff breaking, I think I have the knowledge to repair it if it happens, and that the project I rely upon is abandoned.
Apr 11 16:50:40 <GermainZ>	zaeph: \o/
Apr 11 16:50:45 <zaeph>	It's a comforting feeling to know that you've accrued enough experience to ensure that something works.  I guess you get a similar feeling when you learn how to repair stuff IRL.
Apr 11 16:50:45 <GermainZ>	zaeph: which project?
Apr 11 16:51:24 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I was mostly thinking of org-roam, a package for writing notes and relating them to one another with backrefs.
Apr 11 16:51:48 <GermainZ>	sounds nice
Apr 11 16:52:08 <zaeph>	But I didn't want to commit into it at the beginning of the week because those projects tend to come and go as fall leaves, as the Japanese would say.
Apr 11 16:53:00 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Here's an article which explains the method if you want to browse: https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125
Apr 11 16:53:02 <RoboBobob>	zaeph: Zettelkasten — How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive
Apr 11 16:53:05 <zaeph>	(Yes, __monty__, it's the same article.)
Apr 11 16:54:18 <GermainZ>	thanks!
Apr 11 16:54:29 <zaeph>	Any time!
Apr 11 16:56:14 <GermainZ>	so essentially tagged notes with cross-referencing?
Apr 11 16:56:29 <zaeph>	Yup.  That's the beauty of it, it's very simple.
Apr 11 16:56:50 <GermainZ>	I imagine they'd like Wikipedia :D
Apr 11 16:56:59 <zaeph>	org-roam implements that idea with a sql database, which makes it fairly optimised as well.
Apr 11 16:57:32 <GermainZ>	I like how simple it is
Apr 11 16:57:46 <GermainZ>	You can implement it with notepad and a manual index if all else fails
Apr 11 16:57:49 <zaeph>	Wikipedia is taken as an example in a book I'm reading on a topic, but it's a little different.  The goal of the slip-box (that's the translation of Zettelkasten) if to help you think by writing concise notes.  It shouldn't be exhaustive as Wikipedia is.
Apr 11 16:58:04 <GermainZ>	but of course proper support makes it much easier
Apr 11 16:58:07 <zaeph>	Yeah, definitely.  And if it's plain-text, it's not like it was going to break beyond recognition.
Apr 11 16:58:24 <zaeph>	You could still see where each file points too without needing the software.
Apr 11 16:58:43 <GermainZ>	zaeph: yeah, ideas/short connections rather than full explanations
Apr 11 16:59:22 <zaeph>	Feel free to browse the wiki if you want to get an idea of how org-roam implements it: https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/master/
Apr 11 16:59:22 <RoboBobob>	zaeph: Org-roam
Apr 11 16:59:38 <GermainZ>	RoboBobob: thank you
Apr 11 16:59:44 <GermainZ>	you too, human zaeph

Apr 11 19:20:44 <zaeph>	Time to change.
Apr 11 20:46:35 <__monty__>	I hate those stickers.
Apr 11 20:46:51 <zaeph>	I removed it.
Apr 11 20:47:01 <zaeph>	Lasted a lot longer than the one on my previous laptop, I'm impressed.
Apr 11 20:47:07 <zaeph>	Wait no.
Apr 11 20:47:24 <zaeph>	Man, my old laptop is already 10yo. '_'
Apr 11 20:47:58 <__monty__>	I love how easy developer tools make it to edit CSS live.
Apr 11 20:48:16 <__monty__>	You can make such sweeping changes to improve readability.
Apr 11 20:48:35 <zaeph>	I just spam C-+ until my fingers go numb.

Apr 11 20:54:10 <zaeph>	Don't forgot optimizeLegibility
Apr 11 20:54:16 <zaeph>	Or whatever it's called.
Apr 11 20:54:51 <zaeph>	Looks like it's already on, judging by the ligatures.
Apr 11 20:55:28 <zaeph>	I don't understand why the guy bolded the 'I will now'.
Apr 11 20:56:03 <zaeph>	Bah, go figure.  He's Swedish, they're weird.
Apr 11 20:57:45 <__monty__>	If optimizeLegibility is a firefox option or an addon I don't have it active.
Apr 11 20:58:16 <__monty__>	Btw, apparently darkreader's a pretty awesome extension.
Apr 11 20:58:31 <__monty__>	Haven't been able to try it because the version for safari is paid.
Apr 11 20:58:36 <zaeph>	Does it enforce dark-mode on most websites?
Apr 11 20:59:10 <zaeph>	I'm gonna try it out.
Apr 11 20:59:15 <__monty__>	Yeah but it tries to be smart about it.
Apr 11 20:59:55 <zaeph>	What's it with FOSS taxing Apple users?  Same thing with Anki.
Apr 11 21:00:31 <__monty__>	100$/year to be an apple dev.
Apr 11 21:02:45 <zaeph>	The doc's great for darkreader.
Apr 11 21:03:16 <zaeph>	Gotta figure out how to make the loading page dark, though.
Apr 11 21:03:31 <__monty__>	Mozilla pages block addons
Apr 11 21:03:38 <__monty__>	So you'll have to configure firefox.
Apr 11 21:03:43 <__monty__>	I always make that black.
Apr 11 21:03:47 <zaeph>	Yeah, I figured.  Probably something in about:config to d that.
Apr 11 21:04:00 <__monty__>	I actually have some great styling in my userStyle.css.
Apr 11 21:04:11 <__monty__>	To make the entire firefox UI dark and minimal.
Apr 11 21:04:23 <__monty__>	Even the popup with the link suggestions and stuff.
Apr 11 21:04:57 <zaeph>	Aight, let me try my hand at modifying mine.
Apr 11 21:08:36 <zaeph>	It works!
Apr 11 21:08:44 <zaeph>	Here's a link for those interested: https://gist.github.com/gmolveau/a802ded1320a7591a289fb7abd0d6c45

Apr 11 21:09:01 <zaeph>	And darkreader works great, thank you for the recommendation!
Apr 11 21:19:36 <zaeph>	I'm looking for the CSS option to disable those pesky links at the bottom left of firefox when you're hovering on a link or loading a page.
Apr 11 21:19:40 <zaeph>	They keep flashing white, it's distracting.
Apr 11 21:19:53 <zaeph>	First two propositions from Google didn't work.  Going down the list.
Apr 11 21:20:06 <__monty__>	I think I styled that too.
Apr 11 21:20:53 <__monty__>	Hmm, don't have access to the file rn.
Apr 11 21:20:59 <__monty__>	I could dig it up tomorrow.
Apr 11 21:21:14 <zaeph>	Don't worry, I've got something that seems to be working.  Just gotta tweak it.
Apr 11 21:21:55 <__monty__>	Seems covid got to John Conway.
Apr 11 21:22:53 <zaeph>	Sad.  Didn't know him, but I see that he's done a number of videos with Numberphile.
Apr 11 21:24:10 <__monty__>	Most famously known for Life, a.k.a. the Conway's Game of Life.
Apr 11 21:27:22 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, I remember you linking something about it here.
Apr 11 21:27:35 <zaeph>	The gif made me think of it.
Apr 11 21:27:41 <zaeph>	Or was it an avatar generator?
Apr 11 21:28:42 <__monty__>	I may have linked you a gif of a GoL configuration based on my github gravatar.
Apr 11 21:37:05 <zaeph>	That was probably it.
Apr 11 21:37:28 <zaeph>	Damn, I've almost got it, but the HTML5 transition are not willing to cooperate, even with `transition: none!important`.
Apr 11 21:38:23 <zaeph>	I'll try the scattershot with all the different browser supported settings.
Apr 11 21:48:24 <zaeph>	Got it! ✌️
Apr 11 21:48:58 <__monty__>	Good job!

Apr 11 21:51:54 <__monty__>	Also, physical stuff in general.

Apr 11 21:52:39 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I just use Shadowfox
Apr 11 21:52:46 <GermainZ>	and Dark Reader
Apr 11 21:53:11 <GermainZ>	Shadowfox handles all the browser-stuff (toolbars, about:blank, about:addons, etc), Dark Reader the web pages
Apr 11 21:53:29 <zaeph>	I have a Dark Theme enabled, but it isn't Shadowfox.
Apr 11 21:53:34 <GermainZ>	zaeph: it also makes those pesky link previews dark
Apr 11 21:53:37 <zaeph>	I'll try it out, thanks!
Apr 11 21:54:05 <GermainZ>	Yeah I saw, but that one's really simple and won't cover all things

Apr 11 22:20:05 <zaeph>	How do you even set the Qt theme?  I'm browsing, but I haven't found anything so far.
Apr 11 22:24:35 <zaeph>	Ah, wait, there was a dep I didn't see during the installation.
Apr 11 22:36:02 <zaeph>	Welp, I've created a monster: https://paste.xinu.at/4uJh/
Apr 11 22:39:13 <__monty__>	Ooo, that's not great.
Apr 11 22:42:38 <zaeph>	I'm working on it
Apr 11 22:43:02 <zaeph>	Inkscape does look quite nice, though: https://paste.xinu.at/ahhf/
Apr 11 22:45:40 <__monty__>	Anyone here with an inactive dropbox account got a mail about it being "safe and active?"
Apr 11 22:46:04 <zaeph>	I haven't.
Apr 11 22:46:06 <__monty__>	This would be a very ironic email if it was caused by a compromised account...
Apr 11 22:48:01 <zaeph>	All right, fuck it, I'm giving up on Goldendict's dark theme.
Apr 11 22:48:08 <zaeph>	The code is so antiquated it's not even funny.
Apr 11 22:48:22 <zaeph>	And it keeps segfault on large entries anyway. -.-
Apr 11 22:48:53 <__monty__>	MacOS does have very nice dictionary integration. You get a popup for the word at cursor when pressing ctrl-cmd-d.
Apr 11 22:49:45 <__monty__>	nn, peoples
Apr 11 22:49:46 <zaeph>	Yeah, I think you've already told me of this a while ago.  I use a lot of dictionaries, though, and I doubt I'd be able to have them all accessible as conveniently as it is with Goldendict.
Apr 11 22:49:49 <zaeph>	B-bye!
Apr 11 22:50:22 <__monty__>	I'm not so sure about that. MacOS' Dictionary app is pretty good.
Apr 11 22:50:36 <zaeph>	For shits and giggles, the list: https://paste.xinu.at/FQ1/
Apr 11 22:50:43 <zaeph>	(Sorry for the faded colours, it's all fucked.
Apr 11 22:50:47 <__monty__>	And also integrated with Spotlight.
Apr 11 22:51:13 <__monty__>	Oh, I was expecting and actually long list.
Apr 11 22:51:36 <zaeph>	Well, it's pretty decent already.
Apr 11 22:51:38 <__monty__>	You just have a ton of dictionaries about the same things.
Apr 11 22:51:42 <zaeph>	Enough to cause the bane of Goldendict. :p
Apr 11 22:51:58 <zaeph>	Yeah, it's for intersecting the definitions.
Apr 11 22:52:11 <zaeph>	Sometimes one of them is going to give that extra nuance that you're missing in others.
Apr 11 22:52:12 <__monty__>	There's no dictionary client for emacs?
Apr 11 22:52:25 <zaeph>	There is.
Apr 11 22:53:05 <zaeph>	But I don't think I'd have the OED with nice formatting in it.
Apr 11 22:54:26 <__monty__>	It doesn't read the stardict format?
Apr 11 22:54:51 <zaeph>	Some of them are actually another format... .bgl or something like that.
Apr 11 22:55:05 <__monty__>	Ok, topic for tomorrow maybe.
Apr 11 22:55:09 <__monty__>	Now I'm gone.
Apr 11 22:55:17 <zaeph>	Yup, sorry for keeping you up!
Apr 11 22:55:40 <zaeph>	monty: 1s too late, sorry for keeping you up!
Apr 11 22:56:13 <zaeph>	Oh man, Calibre with dark-theme is nice!
Apr 11 22:56:41 <zaeph>	Glad I took the time to set it up.  I just couldn't be arsed when I got on Linux because I didn't understand global environment. :o)

Apr 12 02:27:59 <Toxmi>	However, I want it to perform fd search on the directory that I call not always on Home.
Apr 12 02:28:20 <Toxmi>	How can I access the current directory variable? I'm newbie in python.

Apr 12 08:40:40 <zaeph>	Oh, I didn't know `--simplify-by-decoration` for `git log`!  Definitely makes it easier to follow what's going on in a flow setup.
Apr 12 08:41:00 <zaeph>	All those merges from master and features branches were getting confusing as hell.
Apr 12 08:42:25 <zaeph>	From this: https://paste.xinu.at/6go0e/
Apr 12 08:42:30 <zaeph>	To this: https://paste.xinu.at/3df7/
Apr 12 09:38:18 <SammysHP>	urgh, I dreamed that vim has become commercial and we have to pay for every mode other than normal and insert. also movements other than hjkl were pay per use
Apr 12 09:39:23 <zaeph>	What do you mean `a dream`?  That's how it actually is.
Apr 12 09:39:28 <zaeph>	It sucks but we got used to it now.
Apr 12 09:39:43 <SammysHP>	oh, maybe I have a cracked version
Apr 12 09:39:48 <zaeph>	:O
Apr 12 09:40:07 <zaeph>	It's not like 100$/year was expensive.
Apr 12 09:40:16 <zaeph>	I think Emacs is 200$/year.
Apr 12 09:40:25 <zaeph>	And that's just for the base packages.
Apr 12 09:52:37 <rnmhdn>	SammysHP: that would be the worst thing in my life!

Apr 12 10:31:52 <__monty__>	zaeph: Nice, the blue is still garish though.
Apr 12 10:38:57 <zaeph>	It is, but I can modify in the CSS.
Apr 12 10:39:09 <zaeph>	It's not local-dictionary config.
Apr 12 10:39:23 <zaeph>	Ain't no darkreader for goldendict yet.
Apr 12 10:40:11 <__monty__>	Glad to see mentioning a single firefox extension didn't completely derail you btw.

Apr 12 10:40:31 <zaeph>	Eh, I'm already back on tracks with the slip-box.

Apr 12 10:41:02 <__monty__>	Yes, you're back on track to my earlier derailment ; p

Apr 12 10:42:09 <__monty__>	Not by me.

Apr 12 10:42:25 <__monty__>	s/about/for
Apr 12 10:43:03 <zaeph>	And vifon introduced me to an rg package for Emacs, and I've been playing with it too. :(
Apr 12 10:43:08 <__monty__>	So now neither of the Bobs are doing substitution?
Apr 12 10:43:12 <zaeph>	Such a scatterbrain.
Apr 12 10:43:16 <__monty__>	Ripgrep?
Apr 12 10:43:21 <zaeph>	Yup!
Apr 12 10:43:35 <zaeph>	So far, I'd just been opening a shell in Emacs cwd, and running rg from there.
Apr 12 10:43:45 <zaeph>	But with rg right into Emacs, I can do cool stuff like replacements!
Apr 12 10:43:54 <__monty__>	What a chump!
Apr 12 10:44:03 <__monty__>	: >
Apr 12 10:44:41 <zaeph>	Also got my PR approved for the Zotero addon. \o/
Apr 12 10:52:28 <__monty__>	Nice!
Apr 12 10:53:59 <zaeph>	It's such a useless PR, too.
Apr 12 10:54:31 <zaeph>	I bumped the number of custom key bindings for citing in alternative styles than your main one from 2 to 9.
Apr 12 10:54:43 <zaeph>	And, wouldn't you believe it, I didn't even write a function to generate everything on a range.
Apr 12 10:54:49 <zaeph>	I just copied the stuff 7 times. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 12 11:12:47 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I installed kvantum-theme-arc (which has the engine as a dep) then used kvantummanager to set the theme
Apr 12 11:13:31 <zaeph>	GermainZ: That's what I ended up doing, but I'd forgotten to set the env for qt5ct. :)
Apr 12 11:13:33 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I would not recommend trying to theme Writer&co's *content*
Apr 12 11:13:49 <zaeph>	(Which it dutifully reminded me of, but which I shamlessly ignored before going hurr durr.)
Apr 12 11:13:59 <GermainZ>	this is how my LO Writer looks like: https://0x0.st/iS5_.png
Apr 12 11:14:12 <GermainZ>	The content itself is not themed because that would just break all kinds of stuff and not be worth it
Apr 12 11:14:21 <GermainZ>	I wish something like Dark Reader existed, but not AFAIK
Apr 12 11:14:33 <zaeph>	I avoid LO like the plague.
Apr 12 11:14:38 <zaeph>	I've never managed to fix the scrolling.
Apr 12 11:14:45 <GermainZ>	What do you use instead?
Apr 12 11:15:00 <zaeph>	The time-waster special package: AUCTeX.
Apr 12 11:15:09 <zaeph>	Even for trivial stuff.
Apr 12 11:15:22 <GermainZ>	I usually don't like office programs (not LO specifically) but no specific complaints about the scrolling
Apr 12 11:15:24 <zaeph>	I've written my own class which does pretty much everything I want.
Apr 12 11:15:39 <zaeph>	It's not necessarily the scrolling inasmuch as it is the zooming.
Apr 12 11:15:47 <zaeph>	I haven't found a way to control the step.
Apr 12 11:16:08 <zaeph>	So it just hyperjumps at 1000% without me being able to control it.
Apr 12 11:16:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: sure, but that's for writing documents. What about when you receive one that's not in PDF format?
Apr 12 11:16:34 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, forgot that usecase.  To be frank, even though I'm a teacher, I rarely deal with other's documents.
Apr 12 11:16:40 <GermainZ>	short of exporting to PDF (which defeats the purpose when editing is required), there isn't much to do
Apr 12 11:16:42 <GermainZ>	I see
Apr 12 11:16:45 <zaeph>	Even my students right now are sending their texts in HTML via email.
Apr 12 11:17:11 <GermainZ>	zaeph: my tip is to use ctrl+± instead of mouse zoom
Apr 12 11:17:42 <zaeph>	I think it's not default.
Apr 12 11:17:57 <zaeph>	Let me check the key bindings real quick.
Apr 12 11:18:36 <GermainZ>	Oh you're right
Apr 12 11:18:53 <zaeph>	What I usually do is just move the mouse to the slider at the bottom right.
Apr 12 11:18:56 <GermainZ>	I misremember, I just use the bottom right zooming to avoid the issue
Apr 12 11:18:57 <GermainZ>	Yeah
Apr 12 11:19:09 <GermainZ>	Now that I've tried… I remember it sucks
Apr 12 11:19:22 <GermainZ>	I'm sure there's a way to tweak the zooming factor but CBA
Apr 12 11:21:07 <__monty__>	I just import into google docs if a pandoc conversion isn't an option.
Apr 12 11:21:22 <zaeph>	Change the keybinding in 'Customize', doesn't work.
Apr 12 11:21:59 <__monty__>	And can't you edit pdfs with the right software?
Apr 12 11:22:02 <GermainZ>	__monty__: sometimes I do that, but I usually prefer an offline solution
Apr 12 11:22:24 <zaeph>	__monty__: I do comments on pdfs via pdf-tools in Emacs.  It works with my supervisors, but my students can never figure out how it works.
Apr 12 11:22:47 <GermainZ>	__monty__: editing PDFs sucks unless it's a form, basically. Sucks much more than the alternative. And if you're exporting from Word using LO… the PDF won't be perfect anyway (and it's quasi-impossible to fix) if it's a complex document
Apr 12 11:22:49 <__monty__>	I understand. It's just such a rare occurence for me that I can't be bothered to keep updating LO's multi-GB behemoth.
Apr 12 11:22:51 <GermainZ>	so not a good solution
Apr 12 11:23:26 <GermainZ>	you'd need to do the editing in LO before exporting, and once you've done that, why bother with exporting?
Apr 12 11:24:28 <zaeph>	Comments and highlights work well, I find.
Apr 12 11:24:37 <GermainZ>	if that's all you need to do, sure
Apr 12 11:24:41 <GermainZ>	I don't consider that editing
Apr 12 11:24:43 <zaeph>	I think both are well supported in Firefox's PDF handler, too.
Apr 12 11:24:57 <GermainZ>	that's reviewing
Apr 12 11:25:00 <zaeph>	Yeah, you're right, but PDF is not really suited for actual editing anyway.
Apr 12 11:25:38 <GermainZ>	Yup that was my point
Apr 12 11:25:47 <zaeph>	Sowwy.
Apr 12 11:25:53 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 12 11:26:17 <zaeph>	I was busy losing my eyes to LO writer.
Apr 12 11:26:24 <GermainZ>	heh
Apr 12 11:26:42 <GermainZ>	it has built-in dark themes for content
Apr 12 11:26:51 <GermainZ>	but if someone colors things the wrong way it's gonna suck
Apr 12 11:27:14 <zaeph>	Oh come on, setting to C-= to '200%' actually works.
Apr 12 11:27:18 <zaeph>	So it's the 'Zoom in' that is borked.
Apr 12 11:27:28 <zaeph>	Bo'shit.
Apr 12 11:27:42 <GermainZ>	Yeah it's just way too sensitive 
Apr 12 11:27:52 <zaeph>	Just like my ex.
Apr 12 11:27:54 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 12 11:28:42 <zaeph>	I set M-1 -2 and -3 to 100% 150% 200%.
Apr 12 11:28:54 <zaeph>	That covers 95% of the stuff I want to do anyway.
Apr 12 11:29:08 <zaeph>	Make that 99%.
Apr 12 11:29:14 <zaeph>	It's actually pretty great, thanks for making me look it up!
Apr 12 11:29:28 <zaeph>	Won't have to pest the next time a colleague sends me a document to review.

Apr 12 11:42:47 <zaeph>	It most definitely is.
Apr 12 11:43:15 <zaeph>	I've called it 'flower-boy' in my snippy (i.e. the program I use for snippets) 'cause it looks damn cute.
Apr 12 11:43:56 <zaeph>	There, fixed the missing space: (✿ ᵔ⌣ᵔ).
Apr 12 11:45:28 <zaeph>	To quote a fellow pisstaker, 'it's like one of my Japanese anime!'
Apr 12 11:45:43 <__monty__>	Thanks, I only knew because I looked it up yesterday, need it for reasons.
Apr 12 11:45:46 <zaeph>	('[...] animes [sic]', actually.)
Apr 12 11:45:58 <__monty__>	Like this one actually: o(>< )o
Apr 12 11:46:09 <zaeph>	Is it pesting?
Apr 12 11:46:23 <zaeph>	I like sad-bear too: ʕ ´•̥̥̥ ᴥ•̥̥̥`ʔ
Apr 12 11:46:30 <GermainZ>	it does bear resemblance to your face
Apr 12 11:46:34 <zaeph>	Angry is lovely too: ʕ •`ᴥ´•ʔ
Apr 12 11:46:39 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Get out.
Apr 12 11:46:53 <__monty__>	Pesting?
Apr 12 11:47:07 <zaeph>	Oh, whoops, doesn't exist in English.
Apr 12 11:47:14 <zaeph>	Pestering*
Apr 12 11:47:25 <zaeph>	Wait, no.
Apr 12 11:47:30 <zaeph>	That's a transitive version of it.
Apr 12 11:47:44 <GermainZ>	zaeph: :D
Apr 12 11:47:57 <zaeph>	Let's just say 'is it not happy about its situation?
Apr 12 11:48:02 <GermainZ>	zaeph: which language were you thinking about?
Apr 12 11:48:06 <GermainZ>	zaeph: whining?
Apr 12 11:48:12 <__monty__>	Yeah, frustration.
Apr 12 11:48:13 <zaeph>	Nah, not quite.
Apr 12 11:48:19 <GermainZ>	complaining?
Apr 12 11:48:30 <GermainZ>	being frustrated as __monty__ said?
Apr 12 11:48:32 <__monty__>	At least that's what I interpret it as. Shaking its little fists.
Apr 12 11:48:35 <zaeph>	'pester' in French, and yeah, showing frustration.
Apr 12 11:48:57 <GermainZ>	zaeph: but pester in French also implies speaking about it, so I'd say whining/complaining works
Apr 12 11:49:12 <zaeph>	True!
Apr 12 11:49:28 <zaeph>	Stop schooling me, Skyler, I'm the ones who teachs!
Apr 12 11:49:40 *	GermainZ slaps zaeph around with __monty__'s earlobe
Apr 12 11:49:43 <__monty__>	Oh, btw, zaeph, copy-pasting is totally expected mode of operationn for Go projects so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 12 11:49:49 <zaeph>	(teaches*)
Apr 12 11:50:04 <__monty__>	Aww, no escape necessary /sadface
Apr 12 11:50:21 <zaeph>	Is that a jab I'm not getting?
Apr 12 11:50:40 <__monty__>	Probably two or more : p
Apr 12 11:51:11 <zaeph>	Is that a OR or a XOR?

Apr 12 12:00:38 <zaeph>	With all that brainpower of ours, we could have found a vaccine for the 'Rona.
Apr 12 12:01:06 <zaeph>	But yet here we are.  Writing useless script on an antiquated communication platform.

Apr 12 12:01:47 <zaeph>	vifon: You don't *want* to fix the 'Rona?
Apr 12 12:01:50 <zaeph>	Rude.
Apr 12 12:02:31 <vifon>	Why contain it? Let it spill over into the schools and churches, let the bodies pile up in the streets. In the end, they'll beg us to save them. 
Apr 12 12:03:29 <zaeph>	Programmers aren't renowned for their outstanding immune systems.

Apr 12 12:04:31 <RoboBob>	Np, vifon.
Apr 12 12:04:32 <vifon>	Love. <3
Apr 12 12:04:36 <zaeph>	One is state-sponsored.
Apr 12 12:05:04 <RoboBobob>	vifon: Peace, bro.
Apr 12 12:05:33 <GermainZ>	vifon: voice acting isn't great eh?
Apr 12 12:05:35 <zaeph>	Can't we have a duel to the death?
Apr 12 12:05:43 <vifon>	GermainZ: So is your face.
Apr 12 12:05:47 <zaeph>	GermainZ: It's… Deus Ex voiceacting.  It's it's own genre.
Apr 12 12:05:48 <GermainZ>	vifon: and the graphics have no aged well. That zooming-into-his-eye looks lame
Apr 12 12:05:53 <zaeph>	(its*)
Apr 12 12:06:00 <GermainZ>	vifon: I've never played Deus Ex, but it's on my list
Apr 12 12:06:01 <vifon>	zaeph: This.
Apr 12 12:06:04 <zaeph>	GermainZ: You look lame!
Apr 12 12:06:10 <GermainZ>	vifon: gameplay's great, no?
Apr 12 12:06:11 <vifon>	GermainZ: I played it a year ago.  It's still fresh.
Apr 12 12:06:19 <vifon>	One of the best games I played.
Apr 12 12:06:39 <vifon>	It was my first time finishing Deus Ex, no nostalgia involved.
Apr 12 12:06:42 <GermainZ>	vifon: I mean I played the original Max Payne a few years ago, so I don't mind the antiquated graphics. It's nice to see the difference tho
Apr 12 12:06:56 <zaeph>	I've just rewatched the entire Legacy of Kain last week.
Apr 12 12:07:03 *	zaeph do the chef's kiss.
Apr 12 12:07:04 <GermainZ>	zaeph: no one asked you, lame-face
Apr 12 12:07:10 <zaeph>	Rude.
Apr 12 12:07:13 <zaeph>	ʕ ´•̥̥̥ ᴥ•̥̥̥`ʔ
Apr 12 12:07:35 <GermainZ>	vifon: how is the Deus Ex voice acting its own genre?
Apr 12 12:07:43 <zaeph>	Because it's terri-good.
Apr 12 12:08:15 <vifon>	The main character has so many roasts for people he encounters he could put you to shame, GermainZ.

Apr 12 12:08:34 <vifon>	Oh for fuck's sake.
Apr 12 12:08:52 <zaeph>	Now that's a bobspam.
Apr 12 12:09:23 <vifon>	GMDX is better for first playthrough.
Apr 12 12:09:40 <vifon>	Revision changes too much.
Apr 12 12:09:43 <vifon>	Even some levels.
Apr 12 12:09:56 <GermainZ>	zaeph: heh
Apr 12 12:10:09 <GermainZ>	It's like crowdfunded voice acting
Apr 12 12:10:20 <GermainZ>	crowdsourced*
Apr 12 12:10:20 <zaeph>	…but it's 1998.
Apr 12 12:10:35 <zaeph>	Nevermind, 2000.
Apr 12 12:10:38 <GermainZ>	vifon: GMDX?
Apr 12 12:10:45 <vifon>	That's what I said, yes.
Apr 12 12:10:47 <GermainZ>	zaeph: other games had better voice acting
Apr 12 12:11:09 <GermainZ>	vifon: oh I see, it's literally called GMDX
Apr 12 12:11:09 <vifon>	http://gmdxmod.com/
Apr 12 12:11:12 <GermainZ>	Yes thank you
Apr 12 12:11:13 <zaeph>	I'm a huge MGS fan, don't worry.
Apr 12 12:11:32 <GermainZ>	What's the relationship with MGS? I've never played that either
Apr 12 12:11:32 <zaeph>	I even know the scene in the toilets with Meryl in Japanese.
Apr 12 12:11:40 <zaeph>	Good voice acting.
Apr 12 12:11:47 <zaeph>	Although slightly over the top.
Apr 12 12:11:47 <GermainZ>	vifon: so you played GMDX?
Apr 12 12:11:55 <vifon>	Yes.
Apr 12 12:11:58 <GermainZ>	zaeph: over the top can be nice, just like cheesy acting

Apr 12 12:12:22 <vifon>	GermainZ: It was a great game in 2019.  It should still be great in 2020.
Apr 12 12:12:23 <zaeph>	Nevermind again, 2001.
Apr 12 12:12:35 <GermainZ>	zaeph: that's pretty damn good
Apr 12 12:12:43 <vifon>	Just force through the first mission.
Apr 12 12:12:44 <zaeph>	That's Legacy of Kain for you.
Apr 12 12:12:57 <GermainZ>	zaeph: great graphics too
Apr 12 12:13:04 <zaeph>	Graphics aren't original.
Apr 12 12:13:07 <vifon>	Legacy of Kain is like a theater.
Apr 12 12:13:16 <GermainZ>	zaeph: oh
Apr 12 12:13:17 <zaeph>	It *is* theatre.
Apr 12 12:13:22 <zaeph>	But it's the same animations.
Apr 12 12:13:22 <GermainZ>	I've been lied to

Apr 12 12:13:57 <GermainZ>	Isn't a movie coming out about Morbius?
Apr 12 12:14:02 <GermainZ>	Is that the Legacy of Kain character?
Apr 12 12:14:08 <vifon>	It is.
Apr 12 12:14:10 <zaeph>	Moebius?
Apr 12 12:14:14 <GermainZ>	Yes that
Apr 12 12:14:19 <zaeph>	I wasn't aware.
Apr 12 12:14:29 <__monty__>	Aw, it's not the comic artist? : (
Apr 12 12:14:46 <GermainZ>	No it's Morbius
Apr 12 12:14:54 <GermainZ>	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbius_(film)
Apr 12 12:14:59 <GermainZ>	And it's about the Marvel character
Apr 12 12:15:09 <vifon>	https://legacyofkain.fandom.com/wiki/Moebius
Apr 12 12:15:43 <GermainZ>	I got confused because they're both related to vampires
Apr 12 12:15:51 <vifon>	zaeph: It would be such a great tragic theater play.
Apr 12 12:16:16 <zaeph>	vifon: There's actually someone who wrote an article on that, but I think it was for a BA, so didn't hold much water.
Apr 12 12:16:43 <zaeph>	Here it is: https://paste.xinu.at/juAV03/
Apr 12 12:16:45 <GermainZ>	BA?
Apr 12 12:16:51 <vifon>	The second Soul Reaver even has the "Dark Chronicle" menu option that reads literally like a play.
Apr 12 12:16:52 <zaeph>	Bachelor of Art.
Apr 12 12:17:03 <zaeph>	So, not a MA thesis or PhD.
Apr 12 12:17:22 <zaeph>	I've made an EPUB of all the dialogues from nosgoth.net.
Apr 12 12:17:23 <GermainZ>	I see
Apr 12 12:17:48 <vifon>	I think I still have them somewhere.
Apr 12 12:17:52 <__monty__>	zaeph: Oh, I thought it was worthless because of the "Arts" part.
Apr 12 12:17:57 <zaeph>	It's here if you don't have them: https://paste.xinu.at/a56RZ/

Apr 12 12:19:31 <GermainZ>	just like your face
Apr 12 12:19:32 <vifon>	zaeph: I love the metaphor of the coin flip recurring through the whole game.
Apr 12 12:19:39 <zaeph>	vifon: <3 <3 <3
Apr 12 12:19:52 <zaeph>	I've *finally* grokked the timelines of the game, too.
Apr 12 12:20:06 <vifon>	zaeph: So this epub is your creation?
Apr 12 12:20:14 <zaeph>	It is!
Apr 12 12:20:15 <vifon>	You've placed these images and so on?
Apr 12 12:20:18 <GermainZ>	ha, nerd!
Apr 12 12:20:22 <GermainZ>	good job toh
Apr 12 12:20:22 <vifon>	Nice!
Apr 12 12:20:24 <GermainZ>	tho*
Apr 12 12:20:26 <GermainZ>	it really looks nice
Apr 12 12:20:27 <zaeph>	Nah, I just ripped everything from nosgoth.net.
Apr 12 12:20:33 <zaeph>	But it did require some tweaking.
Apr 12 12:20:43 <vifon>	Still nice.
Apr 12 12:20:54 <zaeph>	All I did was write a crawler to get everything, and format it accordingly.
Apr 12 12:21:05 <vifon>	I've found it recently in my main Git Annex repo.
Apr 12 12:21:24 <zaeph>	It's a labour of love. ~🎶
Apr 12 12:21:26 <vifon>	It was a nice surprise as I completely forgot about it.
Apr 12 12:21:51 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, I actually made the TOC.  That was a pain to do.
Apr 12 12:23:17 <zaeph>	Here's the website that helped me with the timeline: http://aradiel.co.uk/loktimeline.php
Apr 12 12:52:20 <zaeph>	I was actually about to complain an email-patch having gone unnoticed on the org-mode mailing list, only to realise that it'd already been merged. -.-
Apr 12 13:03:34 <__monty__>	Tsk tsk, no consideration for maintainers...
Apr 12 13:04:21 <zaeph>	Spending time with you as but convinced me that your lives are devoid of anything besides quelling my every desire.
Apr 12 14:26:35 <__monty__>	zaeph: Do you recommend HTTSN before or after the article I linked?
Apr 12 14:26:53 <zaeph>	After.
Apr 12 14:27:03 <__monty__>	Almost done with a book and them I'm taking a look at ldlework's la-karda.
Apr 12 14:27:05 <zaeph>	The article is a nice primer; the book goes in depth.
Apr 12 14:27:11 <__monty__>	Then I can start on the articles.
Apr 12 14:44:33 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: heeeeeey
Apr 12 14:52:16 <lucs>	How do I sort case sensitively?
Apr 12 14:52:46 <zaeph>	i.e. A after z?
Apr 12 14:52:59 <__monty__>	zaeph: The other way around's more common afaik.
Apr 12 14:53:08 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, sorry.
Apr 12 14:53:28 <zaeph>	If it goes by ASCII integer, it'd make sense.
Apr 12 14:53:46 <zaeph>	lucs: Have a look at `sort_case_insensitive` in the man.
Apr 12 14:53:49 <zaeph>	ual*
Apr 12 14:54:09 <__monty__>	You can toggle it with `zc` otherwise change it in rc.conf.
Apr 12 14:54:23 <zaeph>	Hadn't noticed that the `zc` was the keybinding, nice. :D
Apr 12 14:54:39 <zaeph>	Do we generate those tips, or are they hand-written?
Apr 12 14:54:59 <lucs>	Yeah, I want "b A C" instead of "A b C".
Apr 12 14:54:59 <__monty__>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 12 14:55:06 <zaeph>	Tss, I'll have a look
Apr 12 14:55:07 <lucs>	I'll look that up, thanks.
Apr 12 14:55:13 <zaeph>	With my new shiny rg!!
Apr 12 14:55:14 <__monty__>	lucs: You'll get A C b.
Apr 12 14:55:26 <zaeph>	…?
Apr 12 14:55:26 <lucs>	Yes, right, sorry.
Apr 12 14:55:29 <__monty__>	Anything else'll cost you extra : D
Apr 12 14:55:30 <zaeph>	Not b A C?
Apr 12 14:55:50 <zaeph>	Oh wait no
Apr 12 14:55:52 <zaeph>	Sorry.
Apr 12 14:56:03 <__monty__>	zaeph: Capitals are in the upper drawers so it doesn't make any sense to go for the lower drawers first!
Apr 12 14:56:03 <zaeph>	Got confused by what I'd written before.

Apr 12 15:00:09 <lucs>	Hmm... 'zc' here is bound to 'collapse-preview'.
Apr 12 15:00:35 <zaeph>	Welp
Apr 12 15:00:43 <zaeph>	I guess we've got our answer as to the dynamic generation. :p
Apr 12 15:00:53 <__monty__>	Oh, it's zs.
Apr 12 15:01:01 <zaeph>	Try zs
Apr 12 15:01:03 <__monty__>	Guess you have your answer, zaeph : )
Apr 12 15:01:03 <zaeph>	Damn you.
Apr 12 15:01:12 <zaeph>	First!
Apr 12 15:01:20 <__monty__>	We beat eachother to different parts : )
Apr 12 15:01:27 <zaeph>	Best couple evaar.
Apr 12 15:01:35 <lucs>	Yeah, just saw that thanks, but um, I want case sensitive (will keep looking).
Apr 12 15:01:41 <zaeph>	nil it.
Apr 12 15:01:53 <lucs>	Not sure what that means.
Apr 12 15:02:00 <zaeph>	Fuck if I know.
Apr 12 15:02:06 <lucs>	:)
Apr 12 15:02:09 <zaeph>	It means to turn it off.
Apr 12 15:02:12 <zaeph>	It's t by default.
Apr 12 15:02:17 <zaeph>	So zs will do what you want.
Apr 12 15:02:36 <zaeph>	…Why do we even have the negative as t in the first place?
Apr 12 15:02:45 <lucs>	Ah, zs toggles the setting. Perfect.
Apr 12 15:02:45 <zaeph>	Waste of 2 perfect good bytes.
Apr 12 15:02:58 <zaeph>	(I assume bytes, we're in utf-8, right?)
Apr 12 15:02:59 <__monty__>	Stop with the T&A obsession, zaeph.
Apr 12 15:03:53 <zaeph>	I'm more of a Voice & Hands dude, but to each their own I suppose.
Apr 12 15:08:11 <__monty__>	Not intelligent Nerf guns but still cool: http://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf
Apr 12 15:12:13 <zaeph>	Pretty impressive.
Apr 12 15:12:35 <zaeph>	My CPU is already border-line frying with waifu2x.
Apr 12 15:13:21 <zaeph>	Doesn't that potentially have implications for 29FPS→60FPS translations, too?
Apr 12 15:13:29 <zaeph>	Or maybe there's a static limitation on the scenes.
Apr 12 15:15:38 <zaeph>	Props for Minas Tirith, too!
Apr 12 15:16:24 <__monty__>	Not sure of implications.
Apr 12 15:16:37 <__monty__>	Not even sure it'd make sense. This seems very much for static scenes.
Apr 12 15:17:01 <__monty__>	Where you have a ton of pictures of one scene.
Apr 12 15:17:07 <__monty__>	Rather than two frames you need to interpolate.
Apr 12 15:17:19 <zaeph>	Yeah.  I guess I was thinking of how a camera can pan on a scene, and therefore gets data which could be used to reconstruct intermediary frames.
Apr 12 15:17:33 <zaeph>	…But if you have a stationary camera, you can't do that.
Apr 12 15:18:14 <__monty__>	Using video as input rather than pictures?
Apr 12 15:18:18 <__monty__>	I thought about that too.
Apr 12 15:18:28 <zaeph>	Yeah, video as input.
Apr 12 15:18:40 <__monty__>	I suspect the image quality would just not be good enough for the detail they achieve.
Apr 12 15:19:06 <zaeph>	Bah, we'll get there one day.
Apr 12 15:19:10 <__monty__>	There's more info in a video of course. But I expect you'd need an algorithm designed for that.
Apr 12 15:19:19 <zaeph>	And think about the blurriness.
Apr 12 15:19:26 <zaeph>	Motion blur, I mean.
Apr 12 15:19:32 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: hey! :)
Apr 12 15:19:37 <__monty__>	I think this is cooler though. Take a couple snaps of something and you get a complete 3D scan.
Apr 12 15:19:54 <zaeph>	That'll make dickpics fare more interesting.
Apr 12 15:20:07 <zaeph>	(far*, not sure what I was gunning for hre.)
Apr 12 15:20:18 <GermainZ>	won't make a different for you, a dot's still a dot in 3D
Apr 12 15:20:25 <zaeph>	Screw you!
Apr 12 15:20:26 <__monty__>	>.<
Apr 12 15:20:31 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 12 15:20:32 <zaeph>	o(>< )o
Apr 12 15:20:42 <GermainZ>	s/ent/ence
Apr 12 15:20:58 <zaeph>	…Is that on purpose?
Apr 12 15:21:09 <zaeph>	You just wrote 'sentence'.
Apr 12 15:21:34 <GermainZ>	nice.
Apr 12 15:21:47 <GermainZ>	but not, it was unintentional
Apr 12 15:21:51 <GermainZ>	I was just correcting a typo
Apr 12 15:21:57 <zaeph>	I noticed.
Apr 12 15:22:12 <zaeph>	Well excuse me for assuming you're a genius.
Apr 12 15:22:19 <GermainZ>	Ha! Fool!
Apr 12 15:22:30 <GermainZ>	F O O L
Apr 12 15:22:32 <GermainZ>	O O
Apr 12 15:22:34 <GermainZ>	O   O
Apr 12 15:22:36 <GermainZ>	L     L
Apr 12 15:22:39 <GermainZ>	I love this script
Apr 12 15:22:42 <GermainZ>	Thanks, vifon 
Apr 12 15:22:50 <zaeph>	It's gonna get old real fast.
Apr 12 15:23:01 <zaeph>	inb4 you do it again.
Apr 12 15:23:22 <GermainZ>	I shall enjoy it until then
Apr 12 15:23:42 <GermainZ>	this is also fun
Apr 12 15:24:10 <GermainZ>	Truly IRC is the best messaging experience
Apr 12 15:24:34 <zaeph>	You can't even put colors in FB's Messenger.
Apr 12 15:24:40 <zaeph>	Even though we could in MSN.
Apr 12 15:24:46 <zaeph>	Where's my wizz?
Apr 12 15:25:08 <zaeph>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1O9_Q-3jYM

Apr 12 15:25:19 <zaeph>	Truly YouTube was invented for that.
Apr 12 15:30:38 <__monty__>	That and russian climbing vids.
Apr 12 15:31:32 <GermainZ>	And hardbass & co dances
Apr 12 15:35:40 <zaeph>	All right.
Apr 12 15:35:44 <zaeph>	I might have fucked up.
Apr 12 15:36:13 <zaeph>	Changed a key binding in fcitx, the IME manager for inputting CJK characters, and it resetted my xkb setup.
Apr 12 15:36:28 <zaeph>	...I don't have any terminal open that I can access.
Apr 12 15:36:45 <zaeph>	And all the bindings I have for opening terms are borked.
Apr 12 15:36:45 <__monty__>	TTY2?
Apr 12 15:36:52 <zaeph>	That'd be too easy.
Apr 12 15:36:58 <zaeph>	Gonna use term in Emacs.
Apr 12 15:37:19 <zaeph>	Tss, no fun.
Apr 12 15:37:36 <zaeph>	Where are the days when I could bork my system and have to look at wikis for hours on end to figure it out!
Apr 12 15:37:43 <zaeph>	Where's the fun in that?!
Apr 12 15:47:27 <vifon>	zaeph: What do you call the opposite of fun?
Apr 12 15:47:30 <vifon>	defun
Apr 12 15:47:50 <zaeph>	(๑°⌓°๑)
Apr 12 16:33:56 <zaeph>	Time for an Arch update.
Apr 12 16:34:00 <zaeph>	It was nice knowing all of you.
Apr 12 16:34:21 <__monty__>	Hmm, lojban's kinda disappointing tbh.
Apr 12 16:43:18 <zaeph>	Oh no: https://paste.xinu.at/F4Gi/
Apr 12 16:43:29 <zaeph>	(Just kidding, I remembered there'd be an email about hplip.)
Apr 12 16:43:39 <__monty__>	Oh, the joys of arch.
Apr 12 16:43:52 <__monty__>	Are you still not using nix, zaep?
Apr 12 16:44:06 <zaeph>	Will I be kidding anyone if I say that I don't have the time?
Apr 12 16:44:25 <__monty__>	I'm not even talking about nixos.
Apr 12 16:44:38 <zaeph>	Oh, sorry.  Nah, I haven't switched to Nix either.
Apr 12 16:44:48 <__monty__>	Just install nix and start out imperatively installing packages.
Apr 12 16:45:11 <__monty__>	And just fallback to pacman for anything you don't know how to get from nix.
Apr 12 16:45:24 <zaeph>	Could be a good middle-term solution.  I'll look into it.
Apr 12 16:45:50 <__monty__>	Seriously, just run this now "curl -L --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
Apr 12 16:45:53 <__monty__>	"
Apr 12 16:46:14 <zaeph>	First gotta ensure that I don't bork myself out of a laptop.
Apr 12 16:46:19 <zaeph>	See you on the other side.
Apr 12 16:46:29 <__monty__>	Just started on the article btw.
Apr 12 16:46:34 <zaeph>	Good!
Apr 12 16:46:44 <zaeph>	I've read a couple of articles on the Zettelkasten website as well.
Apr 12 16:46:50 <zaeph>	Not everything is good.
Apr 12 16:46:56 <zaeph>	I'm talking about this: https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/
Apr 12 16:46:58 <zaeph>	Rebooting now.
Apr 12 16:47:15 <__monty__>	As in about the method or just the quality of the articles?
Apr 12 16:47:20 <zaeph>	Quality
Apr 12 16:48:38 <zaeph>	I'm alive!
Apr 12 16:48:51 <__monty__>	Heh, I like the quote about the pencil: “That’s it? This little stick is what allows you to communicate through space and time with other human beings and remember things forever?”
Apr 12 16:48:54 <zaeph>	Terminator links are still borked. -.-
Apr 12 16:49:05 <zaeph>	Yeah, that was a nice one. :)
Apr 12 16:49:13 <__monty__>	Ditch terminator and start living the good kitty life.
Apr 12 16:49:38 <zaeph>	Kovid doesn't like Iosevka, so I don't like kitty.
Apr 12 16:49:42 <zaeph>	You reap what you sow.
Apr 12 16:49:57 <zaeph>	And yes, I will die on that hill.
Apr 12 16:51:26 <__monty__>	What's wrong with disliking bad fonts?
Apr 12 16:51:39 <__monty__>	: >
Apr 12 16:51:46 <zaeph>	You imbecile.
Apr 12 16:51:53 <__monty__>	Is it because iosevka lies about being monospace?
Apr 12 16:51:58 <zaeph>	Yup.
Apr 12 16:52:13 <__monty__>	Then why not petition the authors to fix that?
Apr 12 16:52:24 <zaeph>	No Time™.
Apr 12 16:52:30 <zaeph>	Let me look it up.
Apr 12 16:52:37 <zaeph>	…Once I've figured why Anki doesn't start anymore.
Apr 12 16:52:42 <__monty__>	Well DejaVu is a superior font anyways.
Apr 12 16:53:35 <GermainZ>	why does iosevka lie?
Apr 12 16:53:55 <zaeph>	Because it's like 90/100 instead of 100/100
Apr 12 16:53:59 <zaeph>	I don't even remember.
Apr 12 16:54:12 <GermainZ>	but why does it lie?
Apr 12 16:54:32 <zaeph>	Because it's not a true monospace font, but it's used as one.
Apr 12 16:54:51 <GermainZ>	why
Apr 12 16:55:04 <zaeph>	If it's not obvious enough already, I don't know. :o)
Apr 12 16:55:22 <GermainZ>	WHYYY
Apr 12 16:56:01 *	GermainZ slaps zaeph around
Apr 12 16:56:08 *	GermainZ chains zaeph upside down
Apr 12 16:56:09 <zaeph>	Can you not.
Apr 12 16:56:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: why???
Apr 12 16:56:41 <__monty__>	GermainZ: The reason is monospace fonts have to fit W and i into the exact same horizontal space.
Apr 12 16:56:51 <__monty__>	Which is a recipe for ugliness.
Apr 12 16:56:58 <__monty__>	At least in the eyes of most font designers.
Apr 12 16:57:07 <GermainZ>	__monty__: no I get that, what I don't get is that font declaring itself as monospace when it's not
Apr 12 16:57:16 <GermainZ>	The solution would be not to be monospace, and offer a slightly uglier monospace version
Apr 12 16:57:29 <zaeph>	It does.
Apr 12 16:57:32 <zaeph>	There's Iosevka term.
Apr 12 16:57:36 <__monty__>	They don't consider this constraint a refreshing challenge but a curse.
Apr 12 16:57:54 <GermainZ>	zaeph: but you don't use that one?
Apr 12 16:57:59 <__monty__>	GermainZ: You'd be surprised how many "monospace" fonts aren't actually monospace.
Apr 12 16:58:11 <zaeph>	Nah, I use… Wait.
Apr 12 16:58:14 <zaeph>	I think I do.
Apr 12 16:58:21 <zaeph>	All right, let's fire up kitty.
Apr 12 16:58:25 *	zaeph barfs a little in his mouth.
Apr 12 16:58:27 <__monty__>	Aha! So no more excuses : >
Apr 12 16:58:38 <GermainZ>	mhm
Apr 12 16:58:45 <GermainZ>	I just use Source Code Pro everywhere
Apr 12 16:58:54 <GermainZ>	When you get used to $font it becomes pretty
Apr 12 16:59:14 <vifon>	zaeph: I would never trust something called Iosevka after the Iosefka clinic fiasco.
Apr 12 16:59:17 <GermainZ>	everywhere monospace, that is
Apr 12 16:59:23 <vifon>	zaeph: Actually don't look that up.
Apr 12 16:59:30 <zaeph>	I won't.
Apr 12 16:59:34 <vifon>	Spoilers.  Sorry.
Apr 12 16:59:42 <zaeph>	I don't actually use Iosevka, but a CJK version of it called Sarasa.
Apr 12 16:59:42 <GermainZ>	vifon: tell me more
Apr 12 16:59:49 <vifon>	GermainZ: More.
Apr 12 16:59:59 <GermainZ>	vifon: tell me even more
Apr 12 17:00:09 <vifon>	Even more, Germy.
Apr 12 17:00:11 <GermainZ>	vifon: damn that's interesting
Apr 12 17:00:19 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Less.
Apr 12 17:00:26 <__monty__>	Cause less is more.
Apr 12 17:00:29 <GermainZ>	__monty__: too late
Apr 12 17:00:51 <GermainZ>	so zaeph plays Bloodborne?
Apr 12 17:02:20 <zaeph>	I wish.
Apr 12 17:03:06 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what's the issue?
Apr 12 17:03:38 <zaeph>	I don't have a gaming PC for playing the other FromSoftware games.  Dark Souls killed my previous one like 4 years ago now.
Apr 12 17:05:08 <zaeph>	All right.  I hate to admit it, but kitty works.
Apr 12 17:05:11 <zaeph>	Let's try URLs.
Apr 12 17:05:55 <zaeph>	Oh, my compose key doesn't seem to work.
Apr 12 17:05:59 <__monty__>	zaeph: kitty_mod-e allows you to open urls with hints.
Apr 12 17:06:15 <zaeph>	And what's that god awful alarm sound.
Apr 12 17:06:19 <zaeph>	Bell, I mean.
Apr 12 17:06:24 <__monty__>	zaeph: That's weird. I'm on macOS and my kludgey compose key works in kitty.
Apr 12 17:06:54 <zaeph>	And my snippet inserter doesn't seem to work.  Something fucky this way comes.
Apr 12 17:07:37 <zaeph>	Nevermind, it works.
Apr 12 17:07:51 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I thought Bloodborne is a PS4 exclusive?
Apr 12 17:07:54 <GermainZ>	Or is it on PC now as well?
Apr 12 17:07:57 <__monty__>	Don't rush to disapproval, zaeph.
Apr 12 17:07:59 <zaeph>	It is, but I want to play the previous ones.
Apr 12 17:08:10 <GermainZ>	Ah
Apr 12 17:08:18 <GermainZ>	__monty__: ctrl-shift-e for me
Apr 12 17:08:26 <zaeph>	Nah, there's definitely something fucky going on with my xclip.
Apr 12 17:08:45 <GermainZ>	and my compose key also works with kitty (I'm on Lunix, not mac)
Apr 12 17:08:57 <zaeph>	Weird.
Apr 12 17:09:06 <GermainZ>	… ← ← examples
Apr 12 17:09:12 <zaeph>	Maybe there's something going with xcape, then.
Apr 12 17:09:54 <GermainZ>	could be
Apr 12 17:09:58 <GermainZ>	I just have `keycode 94 = dead_greek` in my xmodmap
Apr 12 17:10:08 <GermainZ>	94 being the right alt key for me
Apr 12 17:10:24 <zaeph>	My other dead keys work, so I think it's coming from xcape, yes.
Apr 12 17:11:23 <vifon>	GermainZ: Actually Bloodborne is perfectly playable on PC with PS Now.
Apr 12 17:11:27 <vifon>	That's how I played it.
Apr 12 17:11:30 <zaeph>	Looks like there's an issue: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/171
Apr 12 17:11:34 <vifon>	On my free trial week, no less.
Apr 12 17:11:37 <GermainZ>	vifon: what is that?
Apr 12 17:11:40 <zaeph>	I don't recognise you guys: all the colours have changed. :(
Apr 12 17:11:44 <vifon>	A streaming service.
Apr 12 17:11:48 <GermainZ>	vifon: streaming service?
Apr 12 17:11:50 <GermainZ>	Oh nice
Apr 12 17:12:00 <vifon>	The lag is minimal. Perfectly manageable.
Apr 12 17:12:04 <GermainZ>	Cool
Apr 12 17:12:11 <GermainZ>	Yeah I tried a streaming service last year
Apr 12 17:12:16 <GermainZ>	It was quite acceptable
Apr 12 17:12:23 <vifon>	I only wasn't able to do the gestures as they utilize the touchpad on the PS4 pad.
Apr 12 17:12:25 <GermainZ>	The only annoying thing I had was dark areas and artifacts
Apr 12 17:12:30 <vifon>	So one secret was out of the question.
Apr 12 17:12:55 <GermainZ>	how much does it cost?
Apr 12 17:13:03 <__monty__>	zaeph: Thankfully kitty's colors are easily changed in the config.
Apr 12 17:13:08 <vifon>	Like I said, I used the free trial.
Apr 12 17:13:17 <GermainZ>	vifon: but you buy the game right?
Apr 12 17:13:23 <vifon>	Nope.
Apr 12 17:13:29 <vifon>	It's all inclusive.
Apr 12 17:13:31 <GermainZ>	Ah
Apr 12 17:13:34 <GermainZ>	That's kinda cool
Apr 12 17:13:36 *	GermainZ looks up cost
Apr 12 17:14:09 <GermainZ>	$10/month, not bad, not bad
Apr 12 17:14:21 <__monty__>	zaeph: If you want mine which are low-contrasty but optimized for inter-visibility, let me know.
Apr 12 17:14:22 <GermainZ>	I wonder if I should do this to play Fortnite/CoD with friends
Apr 12 17:14:33 <GermainZ>	gruvbox ftw btw
Apr 12 17:14:42 <zaeph>	__monty__: Sure, thank you.  I might have already stolen yours, actually.
Apr 12 17:15:00 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you don't want mine? :(
Apr 12 17:15:22 <zaeph>	I can try both.  Right now, I'm just trying to figure out how the config works.
Apr 12 17:15:33 <GermainZ>	yay!
Apr 12 17:15:34 <zaeph>	Like how to set up kitty_mod.  Not sure which syntax they use for keys.
Apr 12 17:15:37 <GermainZ>	zaeph: https://0x0.st/iSF2.conf
Apr 12 17:16:01 <zaeph>	I can't click that! >.<
Apr 12 17:16:02 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you'd just `kitty_mod ctrl+shift` for example
Apr 12 17:16:05 <zaeph>	I won't shiftclick like a peasant.
Apr 12 17:16:11 <GermainZ>	zaeph: ctrl+shift+e
Apr 12 17:16:14 <GermainZ>	by default
Apr 12 17:16:15 <__monty__>	zaeph: http://ix.io/2hK2
Apr 12 17:16:26 <zaeph>	wow
Apr 12 17:16:30 <zaeph>	feels like I've turned on the Matrix.
Apr 12 17:16:42 <GermainZ>	__monty__: why is 7/15 disabled?
Apr 12 17:16:53 <GermainZ>	zaeph: pretty cool eh?
Apr 12 17:17:01 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Just default.
Apr 12 17:17:04 <GermainZ>	vifon: and it works well on Lunix?
Apr 12 17:17:06 <zaeph>	Please tell me you can make it start counting from the bottom. (imagine i've inserted my flower-boy here)
Apr 12 17:17:16 <GermainZ>	yes it starts counting from the bottom for me
Apr 12 17:17:23 <vifon>	No idea.
Apr 12 17:17:25 <GermainZ>	that's the default behavior tho
Apr 12 17:17:27 <zaeph>	Oh you're right, I'm a moron.
Apr 12 17:17:30 <vifon>	I used my other PC for that.
Apr 12 17:17:47 <GermainZ>	vifon: Windows?
Apr 12 17:17:51 <__monty__>	zaeph: I think I turned the hints into my home-row before.
Apr 12 17:17:51 <GermainZ>	zaeph: it's ok <3 we're all morons
Apr 12 17:18:00 <vifon>	Ja.
Apr 12 17:18:16 <GermainZ>	Danke
Apr 12 17:18:21 <zaeph>	All right, the only thing that bothers me a bit are the problems with xcape and xclip.  Gotta figure it out.
Apr 12 17:18:29 <zaeph>	No thanks for derailing me *again*!
Apr 12 17:18:34 <GermainZ>	You're fucking welcome!
Apr 12 17:18:45 *	zaeph sulks.
Apr 12 17:18:50 <__monty__>	zaeph: Default 0 means 10. But you can change that back to 0 being the first number.
Apr 12 17:19:21 <__monty__>	I haven't experienced any problems with xclip.
Apr 12 17:19:41 <GermainZ>	probably xcape considering it has issues about it not working in some programs like Firefox
Apr 12 17:19:43 <zaeph>	Oh, I think I know.
Apr 12 17:19:55 *	__monty__ adds another notch to his belt
Apr 12 17:20:06 <zaeph>	xcape works in Firefox for me, though.
Apr 12 17:20:10 *	GermainZ steals __monty__'s belt
Apr 12 17:20:21 <GermainZ>	zaeph: might be env/config dependent
Apr 12 17:20:33 <GermainZ>	but it not working in some programs seems weird
Apr 12 17:20:54 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Do you also have those weird blue shadows around the address bar when you type URLs with the new Firefox?
Apr 12 17:21:05 *	__monty__ 's pants fall down
Apr 12 17:21:23 <GermainZ>	zaeph: screenshot?
Apr 12 17:21:26 <zaeph>	I can't screenshot it 'cause it goes away when I lose focus.
Apr 12 17:21:34 <zaeph>	I'll take a pic.
Apr 12 17:21:58 <GermainZ>	zaeph: https://0x0.st/iSFV.png
Apr 12 17:22:06 <GermainZ>	zaeph: this is how mine looks
Apr 12 17:22:19 <zaeph>	Thought it was a problem with the compositor, which I do not use.
Apr 12 17:22:26 <zaeph>	I think it's my i3 border acting up.
Apr 12 17:22:37 <GermainZ>	it may be
Apr 12 17:22:38 <zaeph>	Yeah it's dfinitely that, let me disable them.
Apr 12 17:22:44 <GermainZ>	I use i3 but have borders disabled so I wouldn't notice
Apr 12 17:22:44 <zaeph>	The joy of updating.
Apr 12 17:23:07 <zaeph>	Nope, still appears.
Apr 12 17:24:19 <zaeph>	Please don't check the metadata: https://paste.xinu.at/woOmr/
Apr 12 17:24:54 <__monty__>	Oops, sorry. Already called in a drone strike.
Apr 12 17:25:04 <zaeph>	God DAMN it.
Apr 12 17:25:25 <__monty__>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What're you gonna do about it.
Apr 12 17:25:32 <GermainZ>	zaeph: it's white for me if you zoom in
Apr 12 17:26:29 <zaeph>	Strange.
Apr 12 17:26:35 <GermainZ>	just like your face
Apr 12 17:28:36 <zaeph>	Let me downgrade Firefox to make sure it's coming from that.
Apr 12 17:29:41 <zaeph>	Welp, Firefox ain't starting no more.
Apr 12 17:30:06 <GermainZ>	no more no more no more no more
Apr 12 17:30:16 *	zaeph claps his hands.

Apr 12 17:31:19 <zaeph>	GermainZ: You're on 75.0?
Apr 12 17:32:02 <__monty__>	zaeph: See, if you had installed firefox using nix, you could've just rolled back.
Apr 12 17:32:07 <__monty__>	: >
Apr 12 17:32:26 <__monty__>	I hate to say "Told ya so," so I won't.
Apr 12 17:32:28 <GermainZ>	zaeph: yes
Apr 12 17:32:28 <zaeph>	Oh you're so old and so wise Mr __monty__!
Apr 12 17:32:35 <zaeph>	Well fuck.
Apr 12 17:32:39 <GermainZ>	__monty__: nixos?
Apr 12 17:32:51 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Even just nix.
Apr 12 17:33:00 <GermainZ>	__monty__: that mixes well with pacman?
Apr 12 17:33:16 <__monty__>	Yes, in that it doesn't, at all. Thanks to its design : )
Apr 12 17:33:29 <GermainZ>	Where does it install stuff? ~?
Apr 12 17:33:35 <__monty__>	/nix/store
Apr 12 17:34:02 <GermainZ>	so you only use it for packages you might rollback?
Apr 12 17:34:09 <GermainZ>	I mean it makes sense to use it on NixOS
Apr 12 17:34:19 <GermainZ>	But I don't fully understand using it with other package managers
Apr 12 17:34:20 <__monty__>	No, you can use it for most things.
Apr 12 17:34:30 <__monty__>	And have the option of rolling back at least.
Apr 12 17:34:32 <zaeph>	Excertp from a reddit thread: `EDIT: Firefox 75 breaks the URL bar and makes it a bit ugly. Working on a fix`
Apr 12 17:34:59 <vifon>	GermainZ: It's a bit like Bedrock Linux but with only two distros.
Apr 12 17:35:02 <__monty__>	Note that rolling back individual programs isn't as simple as invoking a short command.
Apr 12 17:35:05 <zaeph>	Maybe I need to update shadowfox.
Apr 12 17:35:52 <zaeph>	Nope. :(
Apr 12 17:36:31 <zaeph>	Anki won't start even with downgrading.
Apr 12 17:36:49 <__monty__>	Clearly that's because your system is stateful : >
Apr 12 17:37:05 <zaeph>	Yup, I angered the gods with that remark.
Apr 12 17:37:12 <zaeph>	And now it's payback time.
Apr 12 17:37:12 <__monty__>	Downgrading on arch is a crapshoot at the best of times.
Apr 12 17:37:29 <zaeph>	I've still got Anki on my phone, so it's fine.
Apr 12 17:37:47 <__monty__>	GermainZ: There's not that much you wouldn't be able to install using nix on arch. Just the system stuff.
Apr 12 17:38:24 <__monty__>	The part nixos gets you is precisely that. Managing kernel and systemd stuff.
Apr 12 17:39:05 <__monty__>	zaeph: The anki web interface is also useable in a pinch.
Apr 12 17:39:18 <zaeph>	True.
Apr 12 17:39:23 <__monty__>	Do you use it regularly? I've neglected it tbh.
Apr 12 17:39:30 <zaeph>	Very.
Apr 12 17:39:38 <zaeph>	I'd pull you the graphs right about now if I could open it.
Apr 12 17:40:28 <__monty__>	Oh, actually, if you ran that install command from earlier you could just try `nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA anki`
Apr 12 17:41:19 <zaeph>	__monty__: https://paste.xinu.at/SrS/
Apr 12 17:41:35 <zaeph>	I stopped using it for a year or so.
Apr 12 17:41:58 <zaeph>	But I've had Anki for much longer than that.  Kept resetting to have The Perfect CSStm.
Apr 12 17:42:02 <zaeph>	Fuck that compose key. :<
Apr 12 17:42:32 <__monty__>	Do you use it for language learning?
Apr 12 17:42:34 <zaeph>	Where should I run your curl?
Apr 12 17:42:40 <zaeph>	Almost exclusively for language learning, yes.
Apr 12 17:42:45 <__monty__>	On any command line : )
Apr 12 17:43:03 <zaeph>	Tell you what.
Apr 12 17:43:07 <zaeph>	If Anki works, I'm transitioning.
Apr 12 17:43:17 <__monty__>	No promises.
Apr 12 17:43:27 <__monty__>	I've had trouble with anki before.
Apr 12 17:43:33 <zaeph>	Same.
Apr 12 17:43:33 <__monty__>	Using nix.
Apr 12 17:43:38 <zaeph>	Not same.
Apr 12 17:45:03 <zaeph>	All right, it's been run.
Apr 12 17:45:10 <zaeph>	Now for the 2nd command.
Apr 12 17:45:22 <__monty__>	🤞
Apr 12 17:45:22 <GermainZ>	__monty__: it just seems weird to me to use multiple package managers for system-wide stuff
Apr 12 17:45:34 <zaeph>	Should I replace the variable?
Apr 12 17:45:35 <zaeph>	`nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA anki`
Apr 12 17:45:37 <zaeph>	I mean nixpkgs.
Apr 12 17:45:42 <GermainZ>	__monty__: I'm not saying it seeming weird to me makes total sense, but that's what I'm used to 
Apr 12 17:45:45 <GermainZ>	I might give nix a try
Apr 12 17:45:54 <zaeph>	Should I just create .nix in ~?
Apr 12 17:45:58 <GermainZ>	__monty__: distate probably comes
Apr 12 17:46:26 <GermainZ>	__monty__: my distate probably comes from other package managers (language specific ones) not playing very well with the system-wide package manager when you don't install as a user, I guess
Apr 12 17:46:52 <zaeph>	Oh, nix-env doesn't seem to have been installed.
Apr 12 17:46:57 <zaeph>	Prolly 'cause I run it in fish.
Apr 12 17:47:09 <zaeph>	..Or maybe it's loading a script, I don't know.
Apr 12 17:48:17 <__monty__>	zaeph: Ah, yeah, with fish it may not add the right paths. I assumed this had been fixed.
Apr 12 17:48:54 <zaeph>	I'll try rerunning.
Apr 12 17:49:00 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Yeah, nix's design explicitly sidesteps that problem.
Apr 12 17:49:16 <__monty__>	And I didn't suggest using it for system level things. Anki isn't system level.
Apr 12 17:49:29 <__monty__>	You probably *can* but I'm not knowledgeable enough.
Apr 12 17:49:45 <__monty__>	zaeph: Hold up I'll figure out what commands you're missing.
Apr 12 17:50:01 <zaeph>	It's running.
Apr 12 17:50:04 <zaeph>	Did it in bash.
Apr 12 17:50:11 <zaeph>	Downloading anki now.
Apr 12 17:50:50 <vifon>	zaeph: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fzuv4f/my_prettified_orgcapture/
Apr 12 17:50:50 <RoboBob>	(vifon) My prettified org-capture : emacs - 7 comments, 63 points - tecosaur, 5h ago
Apr 12 17:51:19 <GermainZ>	__monty__: system-wide, not system-level
Apr 12 17:51:31 <zaeph>	vifon: Neat!  Doesn't do much on the functionality, but I like it!
Apr 12 17:51:36 <zaeph>	I prefer my org-agenda icons.
Apr 12 17:52:15 <zaeph>	cf. https://paste.xinu.at/pwbZy/
Apr 12 17:53:03 <__monty__>	zaeph: Did you do a single-user or multi-user install?
Apr 12 17:53:12 <zaeph>	__monty__: Yes.
Apr 12 17:53:22 <zaeph>	i.e. I don't know.
Apr 12 17:53:25 <zaeph>	I didn't sudo it.
Apr 12 17:53:56 <zaeph>	All right, anki is installed, which'd it, it's in .nix.
Apr 12 17:53:58 <__monty__>	Yeah but you get to make a choice.
Apr 12 17:54:00 <zaeph>	But it doesn't start either.
Apr 12 17:54:10 <zaeph>	Did I?  It just went ahead and installed.
Apr 12 17:54:21 <__monty__>	And `which anki` points to the one installed by nix?
Apr 12 17:54:27 <zaeph>	Yup.
Apr 12 17:54:35 <zaeph>	That's what I meant by `which`'d.
Apr 12 17:54:36 <__monty__>	Too bad.
Apr 12 17:55:36 <zaeph>	Here's stdout for the install: https://paste.xinu.at/8TeAkC/plain
Apr 12 17:55:51 <zaeph>	So it looks like you gave me the link for single user install.
Apr 12 17:56:52 <zaeph>	vifon: Looking at the code, that looks like a *lot* of stuff for what s/he's achieved
Apr 12 17:57:06 <zaeph>	It's almost as bloated as *my* agenda config.
Apr 12 17:57:09 <__monty__>	zaeph: I think this'll give you the best bang for the buck experience: https://github.com/lilyball/nix-env.fish
Apr 12 17:58:03 <vifon>	Yeah.
Apr 12 17:58:18 <zaeph>	All right, I think qt isn't found in my nix-profile.
Apr 12 17:58:18 <vifon>	I hoped it's more like putting an UTF emoji in the template name.
Apr 12 17:58:52 <zaeph>	Can I do `nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA qt5`?
Apr 12 17:59:01 <GermainZ>	you can do whatever your heart desires
Apr 12 17:59:07 <zaeph>	Thanks GermainZ!
Apr 12 17:59:17 *	zaeph has left the channel.
Apr 12 17:59:20 <GermainZ>	You're welcome, dear
Apr 12 17:59:23 <GermainZ>	❤
Apr 12 17:59:37 <zaeph>	Stop taunting me with your Compose boshit.
Apr 12 17:59:43 <__monty__>	zaeph: No that makes no sense.
Apr 12 17:59:43 <zaeph>	I'll fire up Terminator just for you.
Apr 12 17:59:45 <GermainZ>	☺
Apr 12 17:59:50 <__monty__>	If anki requires qt5 it got installed.
Apr 12 17:59:50 <zaeph>	You make no sense!
Apr 12 17:59:52 <GermainZ>	zaeph: kitty also has neat emoji input, BTW
Apr 12 17:59:59 <GermainZ>	😈
Apr 12 18:00:07 <GermainZ>	ctrl-shift-u
Apr 12 18:00:11 <__monty__>	If anki can't find it that's because your environment variables aren't setup correctly.
Apr 12 18:00:16 <zaeph>	__monty__: Get my stdout you fool: https://paste.xinu.at/wEf3/plain
Apr 12 18:00:23 <__monty__>	zaeph: And that fish plugin I linked would fix that.
Apr 12 18:00:31 <GermainZ>	it's for all unicode, but I use the favorites list for emoji 😎
Apr 12 18:00:40 <zaeph>	Aight, let me pull.
Apr 12 18:01:24 <zaeph>	I don't use a fish package manager.
Apr 12 18:01:29 <zaeph>	Just put it in functions?
Apr 12 18:01:57 <__monty__>	(If you don't use a fish plugin manager you can just copy the script into your own ~/.config/fish/conf.d folder as well
Apr 12 18:02:06 <zaeph>	Good.
Apr 12 18:02:07 <__monty__>	I assume a symlink into the repo'd work fine as well.
Apr 12 18:02:14 <zaeph>	Got it, will do that.
Apr 12 18:03:18 <zaeph>	All right, moment of truth.
Apr 12 18:03:23 <zaeph>	Nope.
Apr 12 18:03:34 <zaeph>	Qt poops itself.
Apr 12 18:03:42 <__monty__>	zaeph: So far this article's been a lot of "Zettelkasten's amazing." And very little "This is what a Zettelkasten is."
Apr 12 18:03:53 <__monty__>	Do you have nix-env on the PATH now?
Apr 12 18:03:57 <zaeph>	Yeah, it's light on the technical details.
Apr 12 18:04:18 <zaeph>	I think, since Anki now points to .niv-profile when I `which`.
Apr 12 18:04:20 <__monty__>	Does anki need openGL?
Apr 12 18:04:28 <zaeph>	I don't think so.
Apr 12 18:04:48 <__monty__>	Does nix-env --version work?
Apr 12 18:05:00 <zaeph>	Lol, niv-env isn't installed.
Apr 12 18:05:12 <zaeph>	Let me try in kitty, maybe terminator's single-session is fucky.
Apr 12 18:05:23 <zaeph>	Nope, not installed.
Apr 12 18:05:32 <__monty__>	You just need to start a new fish instance.
Apr 12 18:05:38 <zaeph>	That's what I initially did.
Apr 12 18:05:41 <__monty__>	If that doesn't work the plugin's probably not installed correctly.
Apr 12 18:05:54 <__monty__>	You didn't symlink to the entire repo, did you?
Apr 12 18:06:02 <zaeph>	I don't have nix-env on the path.
Apr 12 18:06:07 <zaeph>	No, just the confs.
Apr 12 18:06:33 <zaeph>	conf.d, I mean.
Apr 12 18:07:03 <__monty__>	So you have a `~/.config/fish/conf.d/conf.d` pointing to the directory in the repo?
Apr 12 18:07:13 <__monty__>	The link should probably point to the script.
Apr 12 18:07:16 <zaeph>	Minus the repetition, yes.
Apr 12 18:07:47 <zaeph>	I'll just copy paste the file to be sure.
Apr 12 18:08:09 <zaeph>	Wait, no.
Apr 12 18:08:12 <zaeph>	It *is* loaded.
Apr 12 18:08:20 <zaeph>	It's just that I mistook the error for 'command not found'.
Apr 12 18:08:27 <__monty__>	>.<
Apr 12 18:08:29 <zaeph>	nix-env --help works now.
Apr 12 18:08:35 <zaeph>	I'll try again with the symlink.
Apr 12 18:09:07 <zaeph>	Yup, it works.
Apr 12 18:09:17 <zaeph>	All right, what now chief.
Apr 12 18:09:30 <__monty__>	Try running anki again.
Apr 12 18:09:36 <zaeph>	Nope.
Apr 12 18:09:48 <zaeph>	SIGABRT.
Apr 12 18:09:56 <zaeph>	qt: Could not initialize GLX
Apr 12 18:11:22 <__monty__>	Ok, so I'm pretty sure this *is* an openGL problem. You'll have to use https://github.com/guibou/nixGL
Apr 12 18:11:41 <zaeph>	Can I install it with nix?
Apr 12 18:11:51 <zaeph>	Or just clone the repo?
Apr 12 18:12:16 <zaeph>	And yeah, Anki seems to be using opengl.
Apr 12 18:12:19 <zaeph>	Whoopsie, sowwy.
Apr 12 18:12:32 <__monty__>	I think you'll have to clone the repo.
Apr 12 18:12:40 <zaeph>	On it.
Apr 12 18:12:55 <__monty__>	Follow the readme it has instructions to build and install with nix-env.
Apr 12 18:13:36 <__monty__>	This is one of the problems with nix on non-nixos. But it's because GL is horrible, I promise!
Apr 12 18:13:58 <zaeph>	The lesser of two wevils with Arch, I suppose.
Apr 12 18:14:13 <__monty__>	Makes anki a good candidate to just keep installing with pacman when it works again.
Apr 12 18:14:33 <GermainZ>	anki the flashcards thing?
Apr 12 18:14:36 <zaeph>	Yes.
Apr 12 18:14:54 <zaeph>	But it's really not essential.
Apr 12 18:15:01 <zaeph>	I'm barely adding any cards those days.
Apr 12 18:15:31 <zaeph>	If it works, I'll still give you your point, __monty__ .
Apr 12 18:16:17 <zaeph>	Nope.
Apr 12 18:16:20 <zaeph>	Doesn't work.
Apr 12 18:16:40 <zaeph>	And yes, I did run `nixGLNvidia anki`.
Apr 12 18:16:59 <__monty__>	And you're on an nvidia laptop without intel graphics?
Apr 12 18:17:02 <GermainZ>	did you try turning it off and on again?
Apr 12 18:17:13 <zaeph>	I'm on intel graphics, no GPU.
Apr 12 18:17:20 <__monty__>	Then why nvidia?
Apr 12 18:17:25 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I'll tur you on and off if you don't stop your shenanigans right now.
Apr 12 18:17:35 *	GermainZ shenanigans zaeph's face
Apr 12 18:17:39 <zaeph>	Because it mentions it in the wiki?
Apr 12 18:17:43 <zaeph>	oh wait.
Apr 12 18:17:48 <GermainZ>	ha ha
Apr 12 18:17:49 <__monty__>	https://github.com/guibou/nixGL#for-mesa-intel-amd-nouveau-
Apr 12 18:17:49 <zaeph>	I just read the quick start.
Apr 12 18:17:50 <GermainZ>	dum dum!
Apr 12 18:17:56 <__monty__>	Jeez
Apr 12 18:18:03 <GermainZ>	what a noob
Apr 12 18:18:03 <zaeph>	Well excuse me princess!
Apr 12 18:18:07 <zaeph>	Now I've borked my system.
Apr 12 18:18:12 <__monty__>	I can't guarantee it works but I've had good luck with nixGL.
Apr 12 18:18:13 <zaeph>	How do I even unmake.
Apr 12 18:18:14 <GermainZ>	go back to Windows sucka
Apr 12 18:18:33 <__monty__>	zaeph: nix-env -e name-of-thing, to uninstall.

Apr 12 18:49:40 <GermainZ>	__monty__: mine has good contrast tho
Apr 12 18:49:45 <zaeph>	I think I have a custom made script for the colours.
Apr 12 18:49:54 <__monty__>	That's hard contrast in gruvbox?
Apr 12 18:50:05 <GermainZ>	__monty__: either medium or hard, want me to check?
Apr 12 18:50:06 <__monty__>	I don't like the brown background for one.
Apr 12 18:50:16 <zaeph>	Racist.
Apr 12 18:50:21 <GermainZ>	__monty__: it's not brown
Apr 12 18:50:28 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Apologist!
Apr 12 18:50:32 <__monty__>	It's not black, so it's brown.
Apr 12 18:50:33 <GermainZ>	lmao
Apr 12 18:50:46 <GermainZ>	__monty__: you must have a really poorly calibrated screen
Apr 12 18:50:49 <zaeph>	__monty__: Oh yeah, you whiteys only see the world in white and black anyway.
Apr 12 18:51:09 <__monty__>	Don't think so, iMacs usually have pretty good color calibration.
Apr 12 18:51:18 <zaeph>	It's not brown, __monty__ .

Apr 12 18:51:42 <__monty__>	How is that not brown?
Apr 12 18:51:46 <zaeph>	Before I get accused: https://paste.xinu.at/RMZ/
Apr 12 18:51:51 <__monty__>	It's closer to chocolate than it is to black.
Apr 12 18:52:07 <GermainZ>	it's #1d2021 actually

Apr 12 18:52:09 <__monty__>	I think you guys should have your eyes checked.
Apr 12 18:52:12 <GermainZ>	and it's hard gruvbox, __monty__ 
Apr 12 18:52:26 <zaeph>	I think I know why it doesn't look brown to me.
Apr 12 18:52:30 <zaeph>	I also use #141414 for my Emacs bg.
Apr 12 18:52:40 <zaeph>	And I *knew* it was grey.
Apr 12 18:52:43 <GermainZ>	141414 isn't my config tho
Apr 12 18:52:45 <GermainZ>	that's monty's 
Apr 12 18:52:49 <zaeph>	Is it?
Apr 12 18:53:00 <GermainZ>	the screenshot you pasted looks nothing like mine so yes
Apr 12 18:53:12 <GermainZ>	did __monty__ just criticize his own colorscheme as being brown?
Apr 12 18:53:12 <zaeph>	That's not yours? https://paste.xinu.at/5rs/
Apr 12 18:53:14 <__monty__>	1414 doesn't occur in my config.
Apr 12 18:53:19 <GermainZ>	zaeph: no
Apr 12 18:53:34 <zaeph>	Who linked this? http://ix.io/2hK2
Apr 12 18:53:40 <zaeph>	I'll gitblame the fuck out of yous.
Apr 12 18:53:42 <GermainZ>	this is mine: https://0x0.st/iSCj.png
Apr 12 18:53:48 <GermainZ>	zaeph: __monty__ linked that
Apr 12 18:53:50 <__monty__>	I do use a color different from black for text, black on black is obviously not readable.
Apr 12 18:53:53 <zaeph>	__monty__: It's yours.
Apr 12 18:53:58 <zaeph>	So I do prefer *your* config!
Apr 12 18:54:01 <GermainZ>	lame
Apr 12 18:54:11 <__monty__>	Yep, and it doesn't have 141414 anywhere!
Apr 12 18:54:13 <GermainZ>	you two have no taste
Apr 12 18:54:13 <zaeph>	You'll get your rose next time, GermainZ .
Apr 12 18:54:27 <zaeph>	Ah, I think I know.
Apr 12 18:54:36 <zaeph>	I put everything at the bottom of kitty.conf.
Apr 12 18:54:41 <zaeph>	Prolly some remnants of mine.
Apr 12 18:55:10 <zaeph>	So, let me try again with GermainZ's, then.
Apr 12 18:55:23 <zaeph>	Is it this one? https://paste.xinu.at/ONGCPn/
Apr 12 18:55:34 <zaeph>	Ah wait, you linked it, sorry.
Apr 12 18:55:40 <GermainZ>	Yes
Apr 12 18:55:50 <GermainZ>	What are those weird dots at the bottom?
Apr 12 18:56:00 <zaeph>	tmux dying.
Apr 12 18:56:05 <GermainZ>	D:
Apr 12 18:56:12 *	GermainZ resurrects zaeph's tmux
Apr 12 18:56:14 <zaeph>	I think it's because my server-laptop can't do larger displays.
Apr 12 18:56:22 <zaeph>	https://www.colorhexa.com/1d2021
Apr 12 18:56:30 <__monty__>	It's having tmux open in a terminal with a smaller dispay.
Apr 12 18:56:40 <zaeph>	But it ain't opened anywhere else.
Apr 12 18:57:05 <__monty__>	Then it's probably remembering a size from somewhere.
Apr 12 18:57:37 <GermainZ>	"
Apr 12 18:57:39 <GermainZ>	● #1d2021 color description : Very dark (mostly black) blue.
Apr 12 18:57:41 <RoboBob>	(GermainZ) Issue #1 (Closed by Unknown on 2010-02-04): https://github.com/ranger/ranger/issues/1 | Test
Apr 12 18:57:51 <GermainZ>	"it is composed of 12.1% cyan, 3% magenta, 0% yellow and 87.1% black"
Apr 12 18:57:54 <GermainZ>	__monty__: see?
Apr 12 18:57:54 <__monty__>	Try `ctrl-b :set-window -g aggressive-resize on`.
Apr 12 18:57:56 <GermainZ>	RoboBob: you're dumb
Apr 12 18:57:57 <zaeph>	Prolly makes brown, honestly.
Apr 12 18:58:18 <zaeph>	I don't even remember my lead key for tmux.
Apr 12 18:58:19 <GermainZ>	zaeph: maybe if you don't know what brown is
Apr 12 18:58:33 <GermainZ>	zaeph: considering brown has a lot of red and yellow
Apr 12 18:58:41 <GermainZ>	and probably no cyan
Apr 12 18:58:43 <__monty__>	All I know is black doesn't have any magenta! : p
Apr 12 18:58:43 <zaeph>	Also had a lot of blue to muddle up the water.
Apr 12 18:58:53 <GermainZ>	https://www.colorhexa.com/a52a2a this is brown
Apr 12 18:59:04 <zaeph>	Especially in darker shaders.
Apr 12 18:59:14 <zaeph>	This is dark red.
Apr 12 18:59:21 <zaeph>	Do you even calibrate, bro?
Apr 12 18:59:29 <GermainZ>	zaeph: type "brown"
Apr 12 18:59:42 <zaeph>	Fine.
Apr 12 18:59:44 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you're talking about a different shade of brown
Apr 12 19:00:12 <GermainZ>	even that isn't close to dark blue tho
Apr 12 19:00:16 <GermainZ>	unless your monitor has issues
Apr 12 19:00:33 <zaeph>	All right, I need to eat now.
Apr 12 19:00:36 <zaeph>	Been at it since 12.
Apr 12 19:00:39 <GermainZ>	zaeph: watcha gonna eat
Apr 12 19:00:53 <zaeph>	What do you taste like?
Apr 12 19:01:07 <GermainZ>	zaeph: Germain
Apr 12 19:01:23 <__monty__>	Dammit, zaeph, you didn't warn me this article was gonna spawn a slew of tabs!
Apr 12 19:01:34 <zaeph>	I think mpv is borked.
Apr 12 19:01:48 *	zaeph sighs.
Apr 12 19:01:53 <zaeph>	I can't watch the news.
Apr 12 19:02:00 <zaeph>	I can't even know if the world is gonna end tonight.
Apr 12 19:02:09 <__monty__>	zaeph: Install it with nix! : >
Apr 12 19:02:39 <zaeph>	Underway.
Apr 12 19:02:39 <GermainZ>	zaeph: if the world ends, you can roll it back with nix
Apr 12 19:02:55 <__monty__>	Exactly!
Apr 12 19:05:20 <zaeph>	Fucking hell.
Apr 12 19:05:23 <zaeph>	It's working.
Apr 12 19:05:27 <__monty__>	: >
Apr 12 19:05:36 <zaeph>	...
Apr 12 19:05:40 <zaeph>	Should I switch next week?
Apr 12 19:05:41 <__monty__>	Turn to the darkside, young padawan.
Apr 12 19:06:05 <__monty__>	I'd recommend getting a feel for it first. UX is... uhm, pretty bad.
Apr 12 19:06:19 <__monty__>	Hence me spoonfeeding it to you.
Apr 12 19:06:58 <zaeph>	I have one more week of holiday, and not much time to spare.
Apr 12 19:07:02 <__monty__>	Once you realize you're still doing imperative package management rather than declarative package management I'll introduce home-manager. Until then I'm gonna let you live with relative bliss though : )
Apr 12 19:07:20 <zaeph>	How do I update the packages?
Apr 12 19:07:32 <__monty__>	Sigh
Apr 12 19:07:38 <__monty__>	So you don't want bliss, huh?
Apr 12 19:07:40 <GermainZ>	oof
Apr 12 19:07:43 <zaeph>	:p
Apr 12 19:07:59 <zaeph>	I do want bliss, but I just want to be able to update my nix packages.
Apr 12 19:08:05 <__monty__>	This is the first inkling you'll get of the UI being, lacking.
Apr 12 19:08:05 <zaeph>	I'll play around with the idea until I have the time to switch.
Apr 12 19:08:25 <__monty__>	nix-channel --update, updates your channels which are kinda like pacman's package repos.
Apr 12 19:09:09 <__monty__>	nix-env -u will upgrade all the installed packages.
Apr 12 19:09:30 <__monty__>	To update selectively you can just use the install command again after updating your channels.
Apr 12 19:09:50 <zaeph>	Sweet, thanks.
Apr 12 19:09:56 <zaeph>	I'm taking notes, by the way.
Apr 12 19:10:07 <zaeph>	So I can git-blame you in case of breakage.
Apr 12 19:10:11 <__monty__>	Note than nix-env -u is a noop unless your channel has changed.
Apr 12 19:11:45 <zaeph>	I'm supposed to be done with my MA thesis in 3 weeks.  I'll still be giving classes, but it might be a good time to prepare the switch.
Apr 12 19:12:00 <zaeph>	I don't think I'll be able to get into a PhD this year anyway.  Too much hassle at unis.
Apr 12 19:12:12 <zaeph>	Got a bunch of friends who got cancelled.
Apr 12 19:12:57 <GermainZ>	because of the pandemic?
Apr 12 19:13:03 <zaeph>	Yeah.
Apr 12 19:13:15 <zaeph>	Its effects on institutions, I mean.
Apr 12 19:13:24 <zaeph>	Like, students are probably not going to back to school before September here.
Apr 12 19:14:05 <GermainZ>	Where's that?
Apr 12 19:14:11 <__monty__>	Yeah, been kinda hard to keep my niece motivated to do *any* school stuff.
Apr 12 19:14:19 <zaeph>	France.
Apr 12 19:20:52 <zaeph>	I am a little bit worried about mpv and anki breaking.
Apr 12 19:21:03 <zaeph>	Not sure what the common denominator is, if there is any.
Apr 12 19:21:33 <__monty__>	The common denominator is arch lol.
Apr 12 19:21:35 <__monty__>	∠( ᐛ 」∠)＿
Apr 12 19:21:51 <zaeph>	Eyoo.
Apr 12 19:21:56 <zaeph>	All right, cooking now.
Apr 12 19:22:10 <__monty__>	Just being smug but this is what arch's flavor of "living on the edge" always resulted in for me : /
Apr 12 19:23:00 <__monty__>	With nix I just don't experience such problems anywhere near as frequently. And when I do the easiest solution is always a single rollback command.
Apr 12 19:23:23 <__monty__>	And this applies even for kernel changes!
Apr 12 19:25:11 <__monty__>	Finishing up the article, zaeph.
Apr 12 19:25:23 <__monty__>	Let me know when you're free to discuss a couple things?
Apr 12 19:26:09 <zaeph>	Sure.  Probably gonna be off for 45-min.
Apr 12 19:54:56 <__monty__>	https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/life-2
Apr 12 20:05:44 <zaeph>	__monty__: I shall grant you three questions.
Apr 12 20:13:11 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what is your favorite color?
Apr 12 20:13:23 <zaeph>	I'm so glad you got that one, it was so subtle.
Apr 12 20:13:36 <zaeph>	I hesitated to add 'Three is the number of question I shall grant'.
Apr 12 20:13:42 <zaeph>	Different section of the film, but still relevant.
Apr 12 20:14:25 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what are we talking about?
Apr 12 20:14:42 <zaeph>	An article I linked to you as well.
Apr 12 20:14:55 <zaeph>	Whilst I'm fixing xcape on the side.
Apr 12 20:15:04 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I don't see the relevance to colors
Apr 12 20:15:07 <zaeph>	xmodmap works for setting it up, which is good: …
Apr 12 20:15:20 <zaeph>	Wait.
Apr 12 20:15:25 <zaeph>	You weren't quoting The Holy Grail?
Apr 12 20:16:26 <zaeph>	I was referencing this for 'three': https://youtu.be/ashgP4YMdJw?t=82

Apr 12 20:17:22 <GermainZ>	Yes I remember that scene now
Apr 12 20:17:31 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 12 20:18:59 <zaeph>	Oof. https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1381
Apr 12 20:19:09 <zaeph>	(It's about xcape.)
Apr 12 20:19:15 <zaeph>	Just scroll to Kovid's comment.
Apr 12 20:19:29 <GermainZ>	:(
Apr 12 20:26:24 <__monty__>	Answer me these questions three!
Apr 12 20:26:57 <__monty__>	How far does an unladen swallow fly when carrying a coconut?
Apr 12 20:27:08 <zaeph>	European or African?
Apr 12 20:28:01 <__monty__>	Why do you need xcape?
Apr 12 20:28:29 <zaeph>	I use CapsLock as Hyper, and when I don't use it for a chord, I use it for Compose.
Apr 12 20:29:00 <zaeph>	But I think I'm onto kitty's problem.
Apr 12 20:29:22 <zaeph>	I've remapped Compose to Shift-Menu at a low level.  Not sure what the reasoning was.
Apr 12 20:29:25 <zaeph>	I'll edit my xkb file.
Apr 12 20:30:06 <__monty__>	Ok, so the article suggests there's three sorts of notes. I think you talked about this. Notes are like nodes of a graph, connection notes are like annotations to edges of this graph and outlines are like a filtered view on the graph?
Apr 12 20:30:49 <zaeph>	I have an excerpt from the book that will clarify, give me asec.
Apr 12 20:32:05 <zaeph>	https://paste.xinu.at/XEfaon/plain
Apr 12 20:32:21 <zaeph>	It's on the types of links
Apr 12 20:35:33 <zaeph>	I think your assumptions are correct about the types of notes, although I'd put a caveat on the last type.  The bulk of your notes are going to be atomic notes which refer to concepts.
Apr 12 20:36:28 <zaeph>	Then, you have writing-driven notes which aim to articulate your other notes into a cohesive subject.  Have a possible outline for a topic you'd like to write?  It'd go in a note like this.  A revision to that outline?  Just create a new note and call it v2.
Apr 12 20:36:51 <zaeph>	As for your last type, the book makes it clear that you shouldn't have more than one of those note.  It's the index I was talking about.
Apr 12 20:37:44 <zaeph>	A quote on the need for a simple index: https://paste.xinu.at/KnKEr/plain
Apr 12 20:41:18 <__monty__>	Hmm, I think you're wrong.
Apr 12 20:41:42 <zaeph>	Am I? ಠ_ಠ
Apr 12 20:41:45 <__monty__>	You haven't touched on the second type I described. Your writing-driven notes are just the outlines I speak of.
Apr 12 20:42:58 <zaeph>	Your second type seems to be about saying why two atomics notes can be related, correct?
Apr 12 20:44:32 <__monty__>	Yeah, it's clarifying a link.
Apr 12 20:44:55 <zaeph>	It's because I consider those to be part of the same type as the outline driven notes.
Apr 12 20:45:00 <__monty__>	But the manuscript preparation notes that collect a list of identifiers are what I call outlines.
Apr 12 20:45:05 <zaeph>	In other words, it's either atomic or connective.
Apr 12 20:45:26 <zaeph>	Connective can just be two atomic notes, or it can be writing-driven
Apr 12 20:45:35 <zaeph>	That's how I understood it anyway.
Apr 12 20:46:08 <__monty__>	I don't see why you'd merge these. If you take my graph metaphor it becomes clearer how it can make sense to treat them differently.
Apr 12 20:46:54 <__monty__>	Regular notes can also link to things so there's no real physical difference between any of these notes necessarily.
Apr 12 20:47:00 <zaeph>	In my usage, I've been describing how atomic-note-a relates to atomic-note-b in a pagraph on atomic-note-a.
Apr 12 20:47:18 <zaeph>	Yeah, I think that's the crux of the problem: we shouldn't be really thinking about types.
Apr 12 20:47:31 <zaeph>	As long as you're keeping your notes simple and connected, that's kind of the only thing you need.
Apr 12 20:47:38 <__monty__>	No, I think it makes sense to think of the types.
Apr 12 20:48:02 <__monty__>	Your atomic-note-a is no longer atomic because of that paragraph.
Apr 12 20:48:14 <zaeph>	oh no.
Apr 12 20:48:15 <__monty__>	If it works better for you this way that's fine though.
Apr 12 20:48:17 <zaeph>	calibre-viewer is kaput too.
Apr 12 20:48:41 <__monty__>	Install zathura, best ebook reader anyway.
Apr 12 20:48:57 <zaeph>	SHould I try nix-env -a calibre?
Apr 12 20:49:06 <zaeph>	-i, sorry.
Apr 12 20:49:12 <__monty__>	You could use nix to do so : >
Apr 12 20:49:21 <zaeph>	Jesus, take the wheel!
Apr 12 20:49:25 <zaeph>	I know you're busy this weekend but still.
Apr 12 20:49:32 <__monty__>	Do you need to read a document or do you need calibre?
Apr 12 20:49:43 <zaeph>	Calibre works, but I wanted to refer back to my back.
Apr 12 20:49:47 <zaeph>	book*.
Apr 12 20:50:43 <zaeph>	Sec, I'm trying to fix xcape at the same time.
Apr 12 20:53:15 <zaeph>	Interesting.  ebook-viewer didn't work vanilla, but with `nixGLIntel` it did.
Apr 12 20:53:23 <zaeph>	So opengl is borked on Arch?
Apr 12 20:53:27 <__monty__>	nixenv -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA zathura
Apr 12 20:53:33 <__monty__>	Could be.
Apr 12 20:53:51 <__monty__>	Kinda weird that a nix fix works for a non-nix package though : )
Apr 12 20:54:37 <zaeph>	Nah, it was on the nix version.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <__monty__>	Oh.
Apr 12 20:54:37 <__monty__>	I highly recommend zathura though.
Apr 12 20:55:18 <zaeph>	I use Emacs's pdf-tools for PDF, and I've customised the CSS in calibre's ebook-viewer.  What would I get from zathura?
Apr 12 20:55:24 <zaeph>	For ebooks, that is.
Apr 12 20:55:34 <zaeph>	Sticking with Emacs for PDF because of the notes I need to take on them.
Apr 12 20:56:11 <__monty__>	zathura does pdf, djvu, cbz/cbr and postscript.
Apr 12 20:56:26 <__monty__>	And it supports mupdf for pdf so the pdfs are super nice.
Apr 12 20:56:37 <zaeph>	I'm fine with Emacs, then, but thanks.
Apr 12 20:56:40 <__monty__>	Probably doesn't support note-taking well though.
Apr 12 20:56:54 <__monty__>	Then what do you use ebook-viewer for?
Apr 12 20:57:00 <zaeph>	Man, I don't know anything about all those graphic driver packages.
Apr 12 20:57:19 <zaeph>	Just for opening epubs.  Emacs has nov.el, but it doesn't support many html tags.
Apr 12 20:57:25 <zaeph>	Like, not even emph.
Apr 12 20:58:03 <__monty__>	mupdf does epub, so zathura does epub.
Apr 12 20:58:14 <zaeph>	Oh.  Then I could give it a shot.
Apr 12 20:58:34 <zaeph>	I've downgraded mesa, but not sure if I should restart.
Apr 12 20:58:34 <__monty__>	Archwiki on mupdf: It supports PDF, XPS, EPUB, XHTML, CBZ, and various image formats such as PNG, JPEG, GIF, and TIFF.
Apr 12 20:58:37 <zaeph>	*sigh*  This is annoying.
Apr 12 20:59:46 <__monty__>	s/an/arch
Apr 12 21:00:54 <zaeph>	So it is mesa.
Apr 12 21:01:06 <zaeph>	I can start Anki and ebook-viewer now.
Apr 12 21:02:06 <zaeph>	Welp, next time I'll know.
Apr 12 21:02:13 <__monty__>	zaeph: Ok, now for my real not fluff question.
Apr 12 21:02:26 <zaeph>	Did I answer your question, though? :/
Apr 12 21:02:34 <zaeph>	I feel like I've been handwaving it a bit.
Apr 12 21:02:38 <__monty__>	The article talks a lot about the value being in the links more than the notes.
Apr 12 21:02:58 <__monty__>	But it says when adding a note to just link it to at least one relevant note.
Apr 12 21:03:31 <__monty__>	I assume this means you're supposed to add links manually and add them over time when you happen to think of them?
Apr 12 21:03:55 <zaeph>	Yes.
Apr 12 21:04:15 <zaeph>	Roam, the soon-to-be-proprietary software can suggest you entries based on recurring words.
Apr 12 21:04:26 <zaeph>	But in effect, you're the one who has to think of the link.
Apr 12 21:04:43 <zaeph>	The article indicates to have at least one link so that the note is not an orphan.
Apr 12 21:05:09 <zaeph>	Also, why does `nix-env -f <nixpkgs> -eA calibre mpv anki` not work! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Apr 12 21:05:33 <zaeph>	Ah, quotes.
Apr 12 21:05:56 <zaeph>	And the A.  Thought it was for multiple inputs.
Apr 12 21:06:11 <zaeph>	Right, let's try zathura now.
Apr 12 21:06:48 <__monty__>	No, you need to use `-e` without `-A`.
Apr 12 21:06:59 <__monty__>	And you can't always use the name you used to install.
Apr 12 21:07:14 <__monty__>	You need to use the name rather than the "attribute name".
Apr 12 21:07:26 <__monty__>	You can find the names with `nix-env -q`.
Apr 12 21:07:46 <zaeph>	Got it, thanks.
Apr 12 21:15:40 <GermainZ>	you're welcome
Apr 12 21:16:22 <__monty__>	zaeph: You should be able to pass multiple names to nix-env -e btw. And -e doesn't need the -f '<nixpkgs>'.
Apr 12 21:19:03 <zaeph>	I could, but I had -f too.
Apr 12 21:22:00 <__monty__>	It doesn't hurt. Just doesn't help either.
Apr 12 21:27:58 <zaeph>	Sounds like my ex again!
Apr 12 21:29:27 <zaeph>	Keyboard issue makes me want to shoot myself.
Apr 12 21:31:15 <__monty__>	I'm not quite clear on why you need xcape still.
Apr 12 21:31:28 <__monty__>	Is it just the space-cadet-ish double-purpose?
Apr 12 21:31:32 <zaeph>	If you can tell me which key to use for my Compose key, I'll listen.
Apr 12 21:31:37 <zaeph>	It is.
Apr 12 21:31:49 <zaeph>	And I don't think I can sacrifice a key just for Compose.
Apr 12 21:31:55 <__monty__>	I use the menu key to right of space.
Apr 12 21:32:04 <zaeph>	See, I don't have it on my laptop.
Apr 12 21:32:11 <zaeph>	That's Alt_R for me.
Apr 12 21:32:40 <__monty__>	Does caps need to be hyper? And does the other hyper also need to be hyper?
Apr 12 21:32:55 <zaeph>	Win key is Super, Capslock is Hyper.
Apr 12 21:33:04 <zaeph>	CapsLock as Hyper, I find it very useful.
Apr 12 21:33:53 <zaeph>	Left side of the keyboard shifted with Hyper handles system stuff (lock, busy-mode, lid-sleep-inhibit, etc.), right side if app specific.
Apr 12 21:36:54 <__monty__>	Could you google an image of your keyboard?
Apr 12 21:37:49 <zaeph>	https://techaeris.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-5th-gen-2-Techaeris.jpg
Apr 12 21:38:38 <__monty__>	prtsc looks like your menu key.
Apr 12 21:40:44 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, I remember thinking I should modify it.
Apr 12 21:41:06 <zaeph>	I think it's because I wanted to turn it into another alt.
Apr 12 21:41:16 <zaeph>	But no, it makes sense.  I already use Alt_R for dead keys.
Apr 12 21:41:17 <__monty__>	Three alts?
Apr 12 21:41:42 <zaeph>	Nah, Alt_R is for AltGr.  I use it for French diacritics.
Apr 12 21:41:55 <zaeph>	I tried doing them with Compose, but it really slowed me down.
Apr 12 21:42:01 <zaeph>	And it was infuriating when it misfired.
Apr 12 21:45:17 <__monty__>	Fair, I guess. Though couldn't you map the exact dead-key combinations to compose? For example if you use ralt+u to type ù, you could have compose-u mean the same thing.
Apr 12 21:46:24 <zaeph>	You could, but that'd prevent combinations with two letters.
Apr 12 21:46:41 <zaeph>	So, then, before you know it, you have to type compose u u.
Apr 12 21:48:42 <__monty__>	True.
Apr 12 21:51:32 <zaeph>	All right, from kitty: …
Apr 12 21:51:34 <zaeph>	Yay!
Apr 12 21:51:47 <zaeph>	I still don't like change.
Apr 12 21:52:33 <zaeph>	And now, I'm thinking; 'What if I get a computer without that extra key next time?'
Apr 12 21:52:33 <zaeph>	Useless question.
Apr 12 21:54:49 <__monty__>	Feel free not to use kitty. It's a great terminal though.
Apr 12 21:55:45 <zaeph>	It feels more extensible.  Terminator feels like a relic of the past, but it does the job.
Apr 12 21:58:13 <zaeph>	The weird thing is that kitty only does that for Multi_key.
Apr 12 21:58:16 <zaeph>	Menu works fine.
Apr 12 22:05:40 <zaeph>	Do I really want to lose my sanity on this… Mh...
Apr 12 22:09:56 <zaeph>	Welp, it's in C.  Not gonna get really far with that.
Apr 12 22:19:24 <zaeph>	Fuck this. ♪┌|°з°|┘♪
Apr 12 22:22:18 <__monty__>	zaeph: Side note, wayland's coming and xcape probably won't work there anyway.
Apr 12 22:22:23 <__monty__>	It's probably a hack on a hack.
Apr 12 22:22:38 <zaeph>	It is.
Apr 12 22:22:46 <zaeph>	*sigh* It's a losing battle.
Apr 12 22:22:53 <__monty__>	I know that doesn't fix your problem but maybe it's not actually a reasonable solution in the first place.
Apr 12 22:23:01 <zaeph>	I think you're right.
Apr 12 22:23:33 <zaeph>	And the misfires are unbearable too.  It's like a bad relationship: I just can't let go.
Apr 12 22:26:02 <__monty__>	Seems like a habit.
Apr 12 22:26:05 <zaeph>	Like, I even use it for mapping Ctrl_R to M-x in Emacs, and even that only works 95% of the time.
Apr 12 22:26:32 <zaeph>	All right, I'll remove it.
Apr 12 22:26:42 <zaeph>	I don't think I even use Ctrl_R on its own.
Apr 12 22:32:27 <zaeph>	There, remapped Ctrl_R.  I'll probably be mad for a week, but it'll be for the best.
Apr 12 22:37:11 <__monty__>	👍
Apr 12 22:37:28 <__monty__>	Though my rctrl isn't exactly comfortable to type.
Apr 12 22:37:38 <zaeph>	Neither is mine, but I'm used to it for Emacs.
Apr 12 22:37:54 <zaeph>	And since it' too tough to chord, using it for a single action is all right.
Apr 12 22:38:03 <zaeph>	I use it for <menu> elsewhere.
Apr 12 22:38:36 <zaeph>	Oh nice, kitty also has `hold shift and click link to open`.
Apr 12 22:38:42 <zaeph>	It's with `open_url_modifiers shift`
Apr 12 22:39:24 <zaeph>	I think I could get used to kitty.
Apr 12 22:40:32 <zaeph>	Could I took a gander at your config?  I'm browsing the wiki for some syntactical elements, like how to cycle variables, but it's a bit complicated to find.
Apr 12 22:40:46 <zaeph>	Or is it on GH?
Apr 12 22:41:00 <__monty__>	It could be.
Apr 12 22:41:00 <zaeph>	It is!
Apr 12 22:41:07 <zaeph>	https://github.com/toonn/dotfiles/blob/master/kitty/kitty.conf
Apr 12 22:41:09 <__monty__>	Mine is very barebones though.
Apr 12 22:41:25 <zaeph>	I'm trying to find how to cycle the bell.
Apr 12 22:41:27 <__monty__>	Basically just the kitty_mod+o binding. And some changes to the hash pattern.
Apr 12 22:41:29 <zaeph>	'Cause it's useful on weechat sometimes.
Apr 12 22:44:56 <zaeph>	Uhm, not sure if you can actually cycle a value.  Don't see any way to handle conditionals.
Apr 12 22:55:48 <__monty__>	Maybe writing a kitten would be the kitty way to add this functionality?
Apr 12 22:56:02 <zaeph>	Probably.  I'm a little tired and not very efficient tonight.
Apr 12 22:56:13 <zaeph>	Just going to aim feature parity with Termanitor and call it a night.
Apr 12 22:56:22 <zaeph>	Terminator*

Apr 12 23:02:33 <zaeph>	If I could facepalm any harder, I would.
Apr 12 23:02:56 <zaeph>	Whoops, sorry, copied the wrong comment: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/1255#issuecomment-449062502
Apr 12 23:03:57 <zaeph>	I'll see if their fix works with CapsLock.
Apr 12 23:04:39 <zaeph>	Okay, it works.
Apr 12 23:04:43 <zaeph>	Thank god for that.
Apr 12 23:07:08 <zaeph>	Nope, doesn't work as a modifier.
Apr 12 23:12:51 <zaeph>	…Guess I'll just adjust that too.  I'll stop the spam now, this is getting ridiculous.

Apr 16 16:41:22 <zaeph>	I'm writing a lowest-common-denominator function between files (ext, name-base, dir).  It's quite fun.
Apr 16 16:41:33 <zaeph>	I'm fun at parties.
Apr 16 16:55:31 <__monty__>	I like how IRC reveals the imperfections in people's thinking.
Apr 16 16:55:56 <zaeph>	It's the immediacy that makes it so informal.
Apr 16 16:55:59 <zaeph>	And much more human.
Apr 16 16:56:41 <__monty__>	Yeah. Bit like email.
Apr 16 16:57:08 <__monty__>	I do use a chat client that allows editing previous messages but I refrain from doing so on purpose.
Apr 16 16:57:20 <__monty__>	I'm true to my word.

Apr 16 16:57:39 <zaeph>	I was reading the latest book by Cal Newport on Digital Minimalism, and he talks a lot about how the technological revolution has sacked communication in favour of connection, i.e., you're connected to people, but you're not really communication with them in a true sense.
Apr 16 16:58:13 <zaeph>	I'm really liking the GitHub bot in Slack, though.  I've seen IRC channel use them, why don't we do that here?

Apr 16 23:44:41 <nutcase>	hi @all. When I start ranger, it prints INFO and DEBUG messages into my shell. Especially during usage this is quite annoying, since it negatively affects user experience (have to press CTRL-L quite often). What could be the reason for that? (on manjaro, python 2.8.2, ranger-master)
Apr 16 23:47:37 <GermainZ>	nutcase: how do you start ranger?
Apr 16 23:47:54 <nutcase>	with ranger, also tried \ranger
Apr 16 23:48:05 <GermainZ>	nutcase: can you upload a screenshot / pastebin?
Apr 16 23:48:13 <nutcase>	from zsh in urxvt. also tried lxterminal

Apr 16 23:55:12 <GermainZ>	nutcase: what does `which ranger` say?
Apr 16 23:57:46 <nutcase>	GermainZ: /usr/bin/ranger, which is a file with head -n1 = #!/usr/bin/python -O
Apr 16 23:57:52 <GermainZ>	What the hell
Apr 16 23:58:18 <nutcase>	perhaps something with my python config?
Apr 16 23:58:30 <nutcase>	although didn't do any voodoo
Apr 16 23:58:37 <GermainZ>	nutcase: hang around, someone will know. Most are probably asleep currently 
Apr 16 23:59:06 <nutcase>	GermainZ: thank you, will have to leave weechat open

Apr 17 09:56:58 *	Now talking on #ranger
Apr 17 09:56:58 *	Topic for #ranger is: Official ranger file manager channel - https://ranger.github.io - https://reddit.com/r/ranger - Please note that sometimes it may take hours before a question is answered, thank you for your patience | Channel stats: https://einval.eu/pisg/ranger
Apr 17 09:56:58 *	Topic for #ranger set by __monty__!~toonn@unaffiliated/toonn (Tue Feb 12 19:41:59 2019)
Apr 17 09:58:07 <zaeph>	My brain is dying on me.  I can't figure out how to push to the back of a list in Elisp. '_'
Apr 17 09:58:21 <zaeph>	Forgetting how to work with list in Lisp is kind of like forgetting how to walk.
Apr 17 09:58:33 <zaeph>	I know there's one way to cons it to make it work, but my frail brain will not have it today.
Apr 17 10:02:20 <zaeph>	Apparently, the cost of nreverse is linear, so it shouldn't be too bad.
Apr 17 10:03:06 <__monty__>	Linear's not good.
Apr 17 10:03:12 <__monty__>	But you can't do better with a cons list.
Apr 17 10:03:21 <zaeph>	Yeah, that's what I was implying.
Apr 17 10:03:26 <__monty__>	Usually you'd tail-recursively append.
Apr 17 10:03:38 <__monty__>	Definitely don't revers the list twice.
Apr 17 10:04:00 <zaeph>	Yeah, but there's no such thing as push-back in Elisp, just push.
Apr 17 10:04:01 <__monty__>	And if you need access to both ends frequently you should use a different datastructure.
Apr 17 10:04:18 <zaeph>	Actually, I just need to sort an alist, so a list of cons.
Apr 17 10:32:09 <zaeph>	Bah, I think I'll be all right efficiency-wise: https://gist.github.com/g000001/6496523
Apr 17 10:34:00 <zaeph>	If we take the bigget figure, Luhmann had 90k items to keep track of, quite shy of a million. 🤔
Apr 17 10:40:46 <zaeph>	(bigger*)
Apr 17 10:45:46 <__monty__>	Yeah, but are you gonna follow the same pattern?
Apr 17 10:46:03 <zaeph>	For the function you mean, or for creating notes?
Apr 17 10:46:05 <__monty__>	I intend to include links of blog posts I read with very short summaries for example.
Apr 17 10:46:20 <zaeph>	Yeah, it'll scale up with refs, that's for sure.
Apr 17 10:47:00 <__monty__>	I expect luhmann was kept from making such tiny notes because they're harder to keep track of and only rarely useful. But when you have textual search at your disposal, they become feasible to track again.
Apr 17 10:48:23 <zaeph>	Yeah, definitely agree with you on that.
Apr 17 10:52:07 <__monty__>	Omg, my github notifications are blowing up 😭
Apr 17 10:52:19 <zaeph>	ranger?
Apr 17 10:52:23 <zaeph>	Did something break?
Apr 17 10:52:33 <zaeph>	…Did *you* break something?
Apr 17 10:52:37 <__monty__>	5 repos.
Apr 17 10:52:52 <__monty__>	No, this is what I get for helping...
Apr 17 10:53:00 <zaeph>	Jesus Christ, 421 open issues on ranger. '_'
Apr 17 10:53:54 <__monty__>	*Only* 421 open issues you mean?
Apr 17 10:54:10 <zaeph>	(๑°⌓°๑)
Apr 17 10:54:18 <zaeph>	How are we gonna spring-clean *that*?
Apr 17 10:54:24 <__monty__>	We have a "if it's not fixed it's not closed" policy though.
Apr 17 10:54:43 <zaeph>	Makes sense.
Apr 17 10:55:03 <zaeph>	I just think it might be hard to keep track of everything for maintainers.
Apr 17 10:55:12 <zaeph>	Even though I suppose you develop a proficiency for it after a while.
Apr 17 11:02:50 <zaeph>	Also, I said 'fuck it' and ran my own benchmarks: https://paste.xinu.at/jZUnv/elisp
Apr 17 11:03:11 <zaeph>	I'm going to do it with longer lists to see how it scales.
Apr 17 11:03:19 <__monty__>	It's not realistic to keep track of everything.
Apr 17 11:03:23 <__monty__>	You'll burn out.
Apr 17 11:03:30 <__monty__>	Just learn to live with the backlog.
Apr 17 11:04:00 <zaeph>	Oh I didn't mean 'keeping track' as in you know the #number or anything, just that it can reactivate a part of your memory once you see something similar.
Apr 17 11:09:58 <zaeph>	All right, we've got a winner: https://paste.xinu.at/veoyOa/elisp
Apr 17 11:11:54 <zaeph>	…And now I don't remember what I wanted to do with that code.  Story of my life.
Apr 17 11:21:30 <GermainZ>	zaeph: :D
Apr 17 11:21:36 <GermainZ>	zaeph: gotta help our American users
Apr 17 11:21:47 <zaeph>	Hehe.
Apr 17 11:21:56 <zaeph>	Thank you for your service, as they say over there.
Apr 17 11:22:19 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 17 11:25:07 <zaeph>	Use --no-ff they said.  It'd be fun they said: https://paste.xinu.at/gXG2/
Apr 17 11:25:58 <zaeph>	But all hail --simplify-by-drecoration: https://paste.xinu.at/4O9XlF/
Apr 17 12:58:08 <zaeph>	Zing! https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g2fzyr/what_is_your_three_musthave_packages_that_you_can/fnlf8qs/
Apr 17 13:12:23 <__monty__>	I don't even use all of ranger's features, can't imagine wanting more.
Apr 17 13:12:47 <zaeph>	Neither do I.  But it's the usual 'preaching to your own choir'.
Apr 17 13:13:16 <zaeph>	I use them both for their strengths, fully knowing that those perceived 'strengths' might actually be lack of knowledge on the other's abilities.
Apr 17 13:13:51 <__monty__>	One glaring shortcoming of dired is emacs.
Apr 17 13:14:03 <__monty__>	People who aren't bought into emacs don't care about emacs.
Apr 17 13:14:26 <zaeph>	Yeah, can't really speak for them, can I.
Apr 17 13:15:13 <__monty__>	It's almost like "Hmm, could you send a pdf rather than a doc, can't view those properly." "Just use windows." -_-
Apr 17 13:15:37 *	zaeph is slightly triggered.
Apr 17 13:15:59 <zaeph>	I've just given up on formatting when I receive a .doc.
Apr 17 13:16:53 <zaeph>	I believe we've already had this conversation a while ago, but: Should I get into RSS?
Apr 17 13:16:59 <zaeph>	There's a pretty decent browser for Emacs.
Apr 17 13:17:17 <zaeph>	I'm looking into a way to keep tracks of commit updates from GitHub.
Apr 17 13:17:23 <__monty__>	RSS is great. I use it to subscribe to webcomics, blogs, a mailing list and youtube channels.
Apr 17 13:17:51 <__monty__>	RSS would be terrible for github tbh. It's a one-way medium.
Apr 17 13:18:10 <__monty__>	I'd seriously consider email or just living with github's UI.
Apr 17 13:18:22 <__monty__>	Gonna catch me some sun.
Apr 17 13:18:27 <zaeph>	Can you setup GH to send you emails on commits? --
Apr 17 13:18:31 <zaeph>	All right, enjoy it!
Apr 17 13:18:39 <zaeph>	Probably going to do that as well when I'm done.
Apr 17 13:19:34 <__monty__>	Probably, github can absolutely trash your inbox if you want it to...
Apr 17 13:19:39 <zaeph>	no thx.
Apr 17 13:20:43 <__monty__>	I turn off all email notifications except for PR close and review. Just use the notification UI for the rest. Might try migrating away from that when the new UI is forced on us though.
Apr 17 13:20:59 <zaeph>	All right, thanks.
Apr 17 13:21:00 <__monty__>	Tschuss!
Apr 17 13:21:05 <zaeph>	Bye!
Apr 17 13:34:15 <GermainZ>	__monty__: I can imagine wanting more in some places, but it's mostly improving upon existing features
Apr 17 13:34:24 <GermainZ>	e.g. ranger's bulkrename's conflicts
Apr 17 13:34:33 <GermainZ>	and async image previews
Apr 17 13:35:30 <GermainZ>	also side-by-side directory splits (directory A on the left, directory B on the right, and easy operations between them) sounds cool
Apr 17 13:36:12 <zaeph>	I've used tabs in ranger for that, but it's not optimal.
Apr 17 13:36:23 <zaeph>	I'm trying to force myself to use dired for those cases.
Apr 17 13:36:33 <GermainZ>	oh cool, that's already possible
Apr 17 13:36:48 <GermainZ>	open tabs with alt+1, alt+2, etc… then hit "~"
Apr 17 13:37:08 <zaeph>	wow.
Apr 17 13:37:18 <zaeph>	TIL.
Apr 17 13:37:30 <zaeph>	Who implemented that without telling us.
Apr 17 13:37:34 *	zaeph opens git-blame.
Apr 17 13:37:56 <GermainZ>	it was added in 1.8.0
Apr 17 13:38:14 <zaeph>	That's not answering the question *who*.
Apr 17 13:38:58 <GermainZ>	no but it'll help you in your search
Apr 17 13:39:00 <GermainZ>	:p
Apr 17 13:39:10 <zaeph>	I'm just rg for whatever I can find.
Apr 17 13:39:54 <zaeph>	I've got a commit from hut on 2016-04-04.
Apr 17 13:40:57 <zaeph>	Ladies and gentlemen: we've got him.  https://paste.xinu.at/pAzQ/plain
Apr 17 13:43:36 <GermainZ>	Praise be
Apr 17 13:44:01 <zaeph>	And we're not limited to only two panes like silly mc.
Apr 17 13:44:08 <zaeph>	We're the future.
Apr 17 13:44:49 <zaeph>	Unlimited power! https://paste.xinu.at/pAzQ/plain
Apr 17 13:45:04 <zaeph>	God dang it, wrong paste, I'm too fast.
Apr 17 13:45:17 <zaeph>	https://paste.xinu.at/WMz/
Apr 17 14:05:15 <GermainZ>	mhm
Apr 17 14:05:48 <GermainZ>	that's kinda spooky
Apr 17 14:06:02 <GermainZ>	are you hacking the CIA?
Apr 17 14:06:08 <GermainZ>	it says "HACKING.md"
Apr 17 14:07:58 <zaeph>	'I'm in' https://paste.xinu.at/wtV/
Apr 17 14:08:14 <GermainZ>	oh shit
Apr 17 14:08:22 <GermainZ>	zaeph: check out hollywood BTW
Apr 17 14:08:59 <zaeph>	Hah, didn't know about it.
Apr 17 14:09:11 <GermainZ>	zaeph: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hollywood/
Apr 17 14:09:20 <GermainZ>	there's a video here: https://itsfoss.com/hollywood-hacker-screen/
Apr 17 14:09:27 <zaeph>	Thanks sweetie.
Apr 17 14:09:33 <GermainZ>	❤
Apr 17 14:10:13 <zaeph>	I'm sure I'll try running that with fish and end up rming my root.
Apr 17 14:12:19 <zaeph>	'Oh my dear Fräulein, you vant to expand a command to a string? Jajaja, nein, zat is DENIED!'
Apr 17 14:12:31 <zaeph>	(Don't ask me why fish is German, I don't have the answer.)
Apr 17 14:32:41 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 17 15:23:36 <zaeph>	This is pretty cool: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/g2t7uj/pulseeffects_effects_for_pulseaudio/

Apr 17 15:24:23 <zaeph>	All I wanted was a band equaliser, but here you've got the full suite.
Apr 17 15:24:38 <zaeph>	Wow, even for input!!
Apr 17 15:38:33 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I started a thread in wee-slack and I don't know how I did it.
Apr 17 15:38:41 <zaeph>	Is it because I wrote something in parens?
Apr 17 15:54:27 <GermainZ>	zaeph: are you sure you started it?
Apr 17 15:54:38 <zaeph>	Oh, you think it's the person I was talking with?
Apr 17 15:54:39 <GermainZ>	/reply usually starts a thread
Apr 17 15:54:46 <zaeph>	On the last message?
Apr 17 15:54:48 <GermainZ>	yes
Apr 17 15:55:00 <zaeph>	Right, it's probably it, then.
Apr 17 15:55:05 <GermainZ>	zaeph: threads are often used as a way to reply to a comment on Slack
Apr 17 15:55:07 <GermainZ>	kinda like quotes
Apr 17 15:55:09 <zaeph>	I was confused because it literally started right after.
Apr 17 15:55:17 <GermainZ>	it's neat to keep conversations compartmentalized and easy to follow
Apr 17 15:55:20 <zaeph>	Makes sense.
Apr 17 15:55:29 <GermainZ>	zaeph: to see the thread, /thread
Apr 17 15:55:34 <zaeph>	Yup, that you did tell me.
Apr 17 16:08:26 <zaeph>	Pretty impressed with pulseeffects.
Apr 17 16:08:38 <zaeph>	Didn't know about ffmpeg's Crystaliser filter which is pretty epic.
Apr 17 16:08:56 <zaeph>	Here's a description: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/g2t7uj/pulseeffects_effects_for_pulseaudio/fnnrl9i/
Apr 17 16:09:17 <zaeph>	Pulseeffects has a slight effect on CPU usage, obviously, but it might be worth it for some.
Apr 17 16:09:21 <zaeph>	(Especially on desktops.)
Apr 17 17:32:47 <zaeph>	__monty__: Wow, someone did something awesome for org-roam: https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TTPSWL02H-F012ELD29DX/outpu.gif
Apr 17 17:37:42 <GermainZ>	zaeph: we need to sign in to see that page :(
Apr 17 17:37:46 <zaeph>	Yeah, I saw. -.-
Apr 17 17:37:48 <zaeph>	Stoopid Slack.
Apr 17 17:38:13 <zaeph>	There: https://paste.xinu.at/n4Qis/
Apr 17 17:38:46 <GermainZ>	makes sense
Apr 17 17:39:02 <GermainZ>	I mean it is basically a graph
Apr 17 17:39:20 <__monty__>	It's exactly a graph yeah.
Apr 17 17:39:31 <__monty__>	Snazzy visuals are snazzy : )
Apr 17 17:39:47 <zaeph>	It's generated from org-roam files.
Apr 17 17:39:59 <zaeph>	All the links are computed from the org-links in those files.
Apr 17 17:40:01 <GermainZ>	I don't mean the image, that's obviously a graph representation. I mean org-roam itself is just a textual representation of a graph :D
Apr 17 17:40:19 <zaeph>	Everything is a graph!
Apr 17 17:40:20 <GermainZ>	Yup
Apr 17 17:40:22 <__monty__>	I'm not sure how useful that'll be for browsing though. Guess you could spot clusters maybe, depending on the visualization algorithm.
Apr 17 17:40:38 <__monty__>	Identify useful, overloaded and useless notes?
Apr 17 17:40:43 <zaeph>	__monty__: Yeah, that was also my reasoning: finding cluster.
Apr 17 17:41:07 <zaeph>	We could do it with text, like, giving density rankings, but that'd be a little beyond my expertise.
Apr 17 17:41:53 <__monty__>	Talking to someone yesterday I realized being able to refer to parts of notes would be cool. Like if you keep a file of info about people "High priority prank date: [[zaeph]].birthday"
Apr 17 17:42:17 <__monty__>	Automatically adding anchors for some things basically, and having a simple syntax to refer to them.
Apr 17 17:42:30 <zaeph>	We can do that with org-links in org-roam.
Apr 17 17:43:01 <__monty__>	Yeah but do you have to manually add an anchor?
Apr 17 17:43:05 <zaeph>	It's not fine-grained at the moment, and will point to the closest heading-parent, but we could turn it into a regex.
Apr 17 17:43:34 <zaeph>	You can create non-precise anchor whilst staying in the current file.
Apr 17 17:44:11 <__monty__>	Not good enough.
Apr 17 17:44:32 <__monty__>	I don't want to be referencing entire sections, like a pleb.
Apr 17 17:44:55 <zaeph>	__monty__: https://paste.xinu.at/CnJZ/
Apr 17 17:45:35 <__monty__>	Gross.
Apr 17 17:45:38 <__monty__>	: p
Apr 17 17:45:46 <zaeph>	If you mean the theme, screw you.
Apr 17 17:45:50 <zaeph>	I just redid the colours on my modeline.
Apr 17 17:46:07 <__monty__>	Nah, I mean the emacs-ness.
Apr 17 17:46:12 <zaeph>	You're gross!
Apr 17 17:46:16 <zaeph>	Meanie.
Apr 17 17:52:58 <GermainZ>	You guys will keep thinking of new things until you end up using a programming languages with variables for properties and sections
Apr 17 17:53:08 <GermainZ>	and includes for references
Apr 17 17:53:38 <zaeph>	We're not *overthinking* this at all!
Apr 17 17:53:41 <zaeph>	/s
Apr 17 17:54:24 <zaeph>	…It's just notes.  The beauty of the system is that org-roam is just about making things convenient.
Apr 17 17:54:27 <__monty__>	Hah! Jokes on you, GermainZ. I was *already* thinking this.
Apr 17 17:54:43 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 17 18:07:09 <__monty__>	Finished another source on zettelkasten.
Apr 17 18:07:16 <__monty__>	Opened three more tabs... >.<
Apr 17 18:11:13 <zaeph>	I think the slip-box method is god's gift upon us: a recursion error.
Apr 17 18:11:51 <zaeph>	It's like Zeno's arrow.
Apr 17 18:12:01 <zaeph>	You keep thinking you're getting closer to the perfect productive system.
Apr 17 18:12:05 <zaeph>	But you never get to it.
Apr 17 18:13:24 <__monty__>	Well getting to *a* system'd be nice at least.
Apr 17 18:14:16 <__monty__>	Woah, you think that's how systemd got started? 🤯
Apr 17 18:14:38 <zaeph>	🧐
Apr 17 18:15:48 <__monty__>	Wow, color me chastised: "In fact, the more you read on how to do a Zettelkasten, the less you'll actually know, because a lot of it depends on intuition and self-observation."
Apr 17 18:22:38 <zaeph>	Aight, time to stop reading, then.
Apr 17 18:23:12 <__monty__>	Never!
Apr 17 19:16:39 <__monty__>	Wow, somehow navigated into a mire of religious nuts with the zettelkasten reading.
Apr 17 19:17:17 <zaeph>	A while ago, I'd stumbled upon a guy on YouTube who demonstrated how he used org-mode to organise his scripture-reviews.
Apr 17 19:18:24 <zaeph>	But when you think about it, it makes sense: fundamentalist Christians are very much into ascesis, which they stole from the Stoics.
Apr 17 19:18:25 <__monty__>	One more to go before I get to zettelkasten.de.
Apr 17 19:18:39 <__monty__>	.define ascesis
Apr 17 19:18:42 <zaeph>	So, the idea of controlling one's actions and 'resisting the passions' is pretty much up their alley.
Apr 17 19:18:48 <zaeph>	'The practice of severe self-discipline, typically for religious reasons'
Apr 17 19:20:04 <zaeph>	It's especially the Protestants, btw.
Apr 17 19:20:26 <__monty__>	You think resisting passion is necessary/desirable for org-mode usage or note-taking in general?
Apr 17 19:20:52 <__monty__>	Not ime. It's mostly americans. So probably some sort of puritan. Maybe baptist.
Apr 17 19:21:02 <__monty__>	Like the zealot in #proglangdesign.
Apr 17 19:21:34 <zaeph>	Re passions & org-mode usage: Not necessarily note-taking, but org-mode and organising one's life with extreme minutia is something that appeals to them.
Apr 17 19:22:47 <zaeph>	Re 'mostly Americans': I might not be up to date on this.  I've worked on the questions during the English Civil war (17th century) where a lot of the very religious deeply invested themselves into their businesses.
Apr 17 19:23:40 <zaeph>	Anyhow, I'm realising that I'm not making much sense, so I'll stop speaking out of my arse.
Apr 17 19:24:03 <zaeph>	It'd be nice if I had a Zettel on the topic. :3
Apr 17 19:24:09 <__monty__>	Just look at this beauty: https://github.com/AnimaPlacidus/Catholicus-Compiler-Generator/blob/master/PARENT-LICENSE.txt
Apr 17 19:24:16 <zaeph>	not found.
Apr 17 19:24:18 <zaeph>	Nvm.
Apr 17 19:24:21 <__monty__>	s/look/be awestruck
Apr 17 19:24:23 <zaeph>	It's weechat's fault.
Apr 17 19:24:47 <zaeph>	Holy molly.
Apr 17 19:24:54 <__monty__>	Yeah kitty's url parsing can't tell some characters on the next line aren't part of an url sometimes.
Apr 17 19:25:04 <zaeph>	You know it's about to be good when it starts with Latin.
Apr 17 19:25:25 <__monty__>	I forgive it though, url parsing is hard. And I guess I could totally fix it by inserting a single space before the timestamps...
Apr 17 19:25:33 <zaeph>	__monty__: Strange.  Are they working on it?
Apr 17 19:25:43 <__monty__>	Who?
Apr 17 19:25:47 <__monty__>	On what?
Apr 17 19:25:55 <__monty__>	Like I said URL parsing is really hard.
Apr 17 19:25:56 <zaeph>	Re URL parsing in kitty.
Apr 17 19:26:07 <__monty__>	I think Kitty just uses a decent regex and calls it a day.
Apr 17 19:26:17 <zaeph>	All right then.  It works most of the time.  Just had a couple of fuck-ups today.
Apr 17 19:26:17 <__monty__>	You can't really do better than that.
Apr 17 19:26:29 <zaeph>	That's what I do in my scripts anyway, so I can't fault them.
Apr 17 19:26:57 <__monty__>	Is it catching timestamps? Cause you could use my One Little Trick That'll Make XYZ Mad!
Apr 17 19:27:00 <zaeph>	Holy fuck, that licence is hilarious.
Apr 17 19:27:25 <zaeph>	__monty__: https://paste.xinu.at/LhRV/
Apr 17 19:28:03 <__monty__>	Oh, yeah. Can't expect kitty to parse that.
Apr 17 19:28:23 <zaeph>	It's fine, I can just remove the frames.
Apr 17 19:28:28 <zaeph>	When I need to copy, that is.
Apr 17 19:31:19 <__monty__>	Omg, again with the notifications.
Apr 17 19:31:29 <zaeph>	You're famous!
Apr 17 19:32:14 <__monty__>	zaeph: Maybe bind your kitty_mod+e to (send weechat commands to hide panes; do url hinting; send weechat commands to show panes)
Apr 17 19:32:58 <zaeph>	Yeah, that's what I had in mind too.
Apr 17 19:33:17 <zaeph>	But I'm not too fan of kmod+e.  I find it easier to just move with my touchpad.
Apr 17 19:33:29 <zaeph>	I'm moving to Firefox anyway, which I'm browsing with my touchpad.
Apr 17 19:38:49 <zaeph>	'All Works shall be implicitly attributed to God as the first author'
Apr 17 19:38:50 <zaeph>	Lovely.
Apr 17 19:38:57 <zaeph>	This one's for you, god.
Apr 17 19:41:20 <__monty__>	Probably to lock people into the license. Good luck getting written consent from God to change the license later on : D
Apr 17 19:42:00 <zaeph>	I just imagine the FSF dude trying to get a CLA from god.
Apr 17 19:43:11 <__monty__>	Wow, don't call RMS "that FSF dude." He's earned more respect than *that*.
Apr 17 19:43:27 <zaeph>	You know I'm bad with plurals. :(
Apr 17 19:43:56 <zaeph>	Have you met him IRL?
Apr 17 19:44:03 <__monty__>	I have not.
Apr 17 19:44:12 <zaeph>	Well, I have. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 17 19:47:47 <__monty__>	I didn't say he's not weird or a nice person to be around though. But his fight for floss should earn him at least some appreciation.
Apr 17 19:48:14 <zaeph>	Oh I wasn't saying this to say that he was mean, sorry.
Apr 17 19:48:18 <__monty__>	Oh, TIL, you can type arithmetic expressions in GTK's numeric fields.
Apr 17 19:48:19 <zaeph>	I was just bragging.
Apr 17 19:48:37 <__monty__>	Wow, stop flexing.
Apr 17 19:48:51 <zaeph>	💪
Apr 17 19:49:48 <zaeph>	Honestly, his presentation was a little long-winded, and he's been a bit of a pain for the organiser.  One of my colleague who was organising his coming was relegated to being a tea-boy.  Aside from that, great guy with great ideas.
Apr 17 19:50:17 <zaeph>	He only started listening to me when I told him I was working on fixing 1-line subtrees in org-mode, and he wished me luck.
Apr 17 20:09:44 <zaeph>	__monty__: Did you know about having multiple tabs opened in ranger and pressing ~?
Apr 17 20:11:11 <__monty__>	Yes, it's literally in the README.
Apr 17 20:11:18 <__monty__>	That's the multipane viewmode.
Apr 17 20:11:22 <zaeph>	I didn't know about it.
Apr 17 20:11:35 <zaeph>	Tracked whoddunit, and realised it was hut in 2016.
Apr 17 20:11:37 <__monty__>	I think you've even used it as a meme/troll.
Apr 17 20:12:10 <__monty__>	Check the second set of screenshots in the README.
Apr 17 20:12:41 <zaeph>	Believe it or not, I've actually *never* looked at those screenshot in depths.
Apr 17 20:12:46 <zaeph>	(depth*, goddangit.
Apr 17 20:12:57 <zaeph>	(Sorry, the licence say I shouldn't say that.)
Apr 17 20:15:51 <__monty__>	zaeph: Hmm, "but some of the content seems like bad science to me" that's someone's opinion on HTTSN.
Apr 17 20:15:58 <__monty__>	Have you felt something similar?
Apr 17 20:16:29 <__monty__>	It's specifically about stuff "such as the description of growth mindset, which didn't strike me as at all accurate"
Apr 17 20:17:49 <zaeph>	I didn't feel it, but I wasn't reading the sciency part into too much details.
Apr 17 20:18:00 <zaeph>	Based on what I've read from Cal Newport, it seemed pretty close.
Apr 17 20:19:49 <__monty__>	They still recommend it as the best write-up of Zettelkasten in english btw.
Apr 17 20:20:10 <zaeph>	Great.  Glad I found it on the org-roam's maintainer blog.
Apr 17 20:21:01 <__monty__>	They mentioned Roam. Supposedly it's intentionally designed to "nudge users into good thinking patterns with awareness of cognitive biases"
Apr 17 20:23:48 <zaeph>	Yeah, and that's what the book is going into.
Apr 17 20:24:04 <zaeph>	Tbf, I didn't feel the pseudo-science that the person you mentioned claims.
Apr 17 20:24:39 <zaeph>	And I've been reading quite a number of books on academic writing.  Seemed pretty similar in terms of content and theoretical grounding, and those books were hailed by the research community.
Apr 17 20:24:42 <__monty__>	Note that it's a post on lesswrong.com. They're often a bit abrasive and echo chamber-y.
Apr 17 20:24:58 <zaeph>	Oh, that explains *everything*.
Apr 17 20:25:10 <zaeph>	Really not a fan of the community.
Apr 17 20:25:18 <zaeph>	Or 'rational' folks in general.
Apr 17 20:25:57 <__monty__>	I don't care what the folks are like. If I read their post and it makes sense I'm not gonna deny it.
Apr 17 20:26:49 <__monty__>	It's like ESR. Is he an abrasive person? Yes. But do I think some of his writing's good enough to recommend? Yes.
Apr 17 20:26:51 <zaeph>	That's so *rational* of you. :)
Apr 17 20:27:41 <__monty__>	Hey, I can easily throw zingers your way about how social scientist consensus is useless.
Apr 17 20:29:01 <__monty__>	Yes, I'm referring to the fake papers that were peer reviewed and accepted : >
Apr 17 20:29:29 <zaeph>	Was it you who linked me those articles?
Apr 17 20:29:37 <zaeph>	Nah, wait, I think it was in one of my readings.
Apr 17 20:29:57 <zaeph>	A whole article of boshit that got published.
Apr 17 20:30:03 <zaeph>	And then they wrote a paper on the process.
Apr 17 20:30:42 <zaeph>	Ah, wait, now I remember.  It was about criticising the French theorist in the US who are deemed to talk out of their arse constantly with useless jargon.
Apr 17 20:30:49 <__monty__>	I think it was specifically to call out SJW "scientists."
Apr 17 20:33:40 <zaeph>	Understandable.  The French Theory in the US (think Derrida, Foucault, Lacan, etc.) have really been influential, but a lot of people in the late 90s/early 2000s went all in, and it stopped making sense.
Apr 17 20:42:18 <zaeph>	My mind is telling me no~ 🎶 https://paste.xinu.at/wWZRfJ/
Apr 17 20:43:13 <__monty__>	Tempted by the Planck, huh?
Apr 17 20:43:19 <zaeph>	Yeah.  A lot.
Apr 17 20:43:51 <zaeph>	And I've had a bit of a government-subsidised windfall, so I figure I might splurge a bit.
Apr 17 20:44:40 <zaeph>	I'm just waiting on a reply to an email I've shot to their customer team, and I think I'll order after.
Apr 17 20:45:12 <__monty__>	Definitely ask vifon about his QMK setup for it. So you can better gauge whether it'd work for you. I think blawiz isn't really hyped about his.
Apr 17 20:46:05 <zaeph>	His Planck, you mean?
Apr 17 20:46:13 <zaeph>	And I've been talking with vifon about it.  He's spread the disease.
Apr 17 20:46:26 <zaeph>	I blame kitty's lack of support for xcape.
Apr 17 20:47:22 <__monty__>	Yeah, he loves the thing.
Apr 17 20:47:32 <__monty__>	Smh, what's all this talking behind my back.
Apr 17 20:47:50 <zaeph>	Sowwy.  vifon's been busy with work I think.
Apr 17 20:48:25 <__monty__>	I think he's just hiding from me because he knows I have some PRs with his name on them >: )
Apr 17 20:48:53 <zaeph>	I can close my eyes and picture the `Your thoughts, @vifon?`.
Apr 17 20:58:19 <blawiz>	planck is VERY nice, but so small, so in a office type setting its kinda annoying to keep hans so close working, but if it works for you its nice
Apr 17 20:58:50 <blawiz>	very simple/robust/clean
Apr 17 20:59:05 <blawiz>	*hands
Apr 17 20:59:52 <zaeph>	Do you have the EZ, blawiz?
Apr 17 21:00:10 <blawiz>	whats ez?
Apr 17 21:00:30 <blawiz>	the case?
Apr 17 21:00:42 <blawiz>	i think i have a low profile steel one
Apr 17 21:00:46 <zaeph>	blawiz: https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck
Apr 17 21:01:04 <zaeph>	Ergodox is shipping their own Planck, not sure since how long.
Apr 17 21:01:18 <blawiz>	bought on massdrop, but it does look similar to this one
Apr 17 21:02:05 <zaeph>	vifon also recommended the... P… Peonic?
Apr 17 21:02:11 <zaeph>	Preonic?  Something like that.
Apr 17 21:02:18 <blawiz>	mhm
Apr 17 21:02:39 <zaeph>	But I'm not sure how long I'd be waiting on Massdrop to get one.
Apr 17 21:02:46 <blawiz>	i guess it will be easier to switch between preonic and a normal keyboard
Apr 17 21:02:49 <zaeph>	And Ergodox are shipping now.
Apr 17 21:02:57 <zaeph>	Is it a bit larger?
Apr 17 21:03:02 <blawiz>	ah yes, it took very long x.x
Apr 17 21:03:12 <blawiz>	yeas it has anothe row
Apr 17 21:03:26 <blawiz>	i guess the length is the same
Apr 17 21:03:27 <zaeph>	Hadn't even noticed.
Apr 17 21:03:40 <zaeph>	Do you know how often they come up on Drop?
Apr 17 21:03:57 <blawiz>	no i dunno
Apr 17 21:05:03 <zaeph>	All right, thanks for your help.
Apr 17 21:05:27 <zaeph>	I think I'll try Ergodox's Planck for shits and giggles.
Apr 17 21:07:16 <blawiz>	ah i guess you saw the ez v olbk planck comparison
Apr 17 21:07:43 <zaeph>	I've looked it up, but do you have a link to the one you have in mind?
Apr 17 21:08:00 <blawiz>	https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck-ez-vs-olkb-planck
Apr 17 21:08:12 <zaeph>	Oh, it's on their website.
Apr 17 21:08:12 <blawiz>	hmm it says 1-4 months delivery for the olkb
Apr 17 21:08:28 <blawiz>	had the impression it was much longer
Apr 17 21:09:14 <blawiz>	s/months/weeks
Apr 17 21:09:25 <zaeph>	Yeah, and with the 'Rona, I think it'll be even longer.
Apr 17 21:09:36 <zaeph>	That's why I think going for the EZ might be the best shot.
Apr 17 21:09:47 <blawiz>	mhm
Apr 17 21:10:16 <tomasi>	Hi guys.. I would like to know, how to select some specific files, Like "*.jpg" via ranger..
Apr 17 21:11:05 <tomasi>	I'm using ranger 1.8.1
Apr 17 21:12:05 <zaeph>	tomasi: You could filter with `zf`, and then select everything with `v`.
Apr 17 21:12:11 <tomasi>	I've tried :select_file but it didn't help
Apr 17 21:13:38 <tomasi>	aahaaa... coool zaeph thx a lot ;)
Apr 17 21:13:48 <zaeph>	tomasi: Any time!
Apr 17 21:14:10 <zaeph>	There's probably a single command for it, but I couldn't find it by browsing the man quickly.
Apr 17 21:17:22 <tomasi>	np.. this helps ;)
Apr 17 21:24:56 <__monty__>	Hate it when people pop in and out like that.
Apr 17 21:25:06 <__monty__>	Sounds like he was looking for the :mark command.
Apr 17 21:25:15 <__monty__>	*they I guess.
Apr 17 21:25:27 <zaeph>	I did try :mark, but I couldn't find it in the keys.  Probably was too low in the man when I /.
Apr 17 21:25:52 <zaeph>	And I don't mind.  Not everyone can just hang out in IRC all the time.
Apr 17 21:27:18 <__monty__>	If you have time to ask a question you can hang around for 5 minutes.
Apr 17 21:30:41 <zaeph>	True.
Apr 17 21:30:55 <zaeph>	But it feels like it's someone who'd get on IRC via a web-app or something.
Apr 17 21:31:42 <__monty__>	Still
Apr 17 21:32:54 <zaeph>	Hear hear, it's fine.  We're not in this for the recognition or the good treatment.
Apr 17 21:35:22 <__monty__>	I don't care about that. I care about transmitting accurate info.
Apr 17 21:36:59 <zaeph>	Oh, you mean to correct what I'd told him?
Apr 17 21:37:34 <__monty__>	Yah.
Apr 17 21:37:41 <__monty__>	Can't let people think you knew something.
Apr 17 21:37:48 <zaeph>	Hehe.
Apr 17 21:37:56 <zaeph>	I thought it was about having them show a sense of community.
Apr 17 21:38:05 <zaeph>	SO that's why I wasn't getting it.
Apr 17 21:38:30 <__monty__>	Yeah, you're pretty thick.
Apr 17 21:38:37 <__monty__>	ZING : >
Apr 17 21:38:55 <zaeph>	:(
Apr 17 22:18:51 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Apr 17 22:19:03 <zaeph>	__monty__: Bye!
Apr 17 22:19:08 <zaeph>	Dang it.
Apr 17 22:19:14 <zaeph>	Not even a second late. :(
Apr 17 22:19:46 <zaeph>	__monty__: Missing you already. https://paste.xinu.at/xwl/
Apr 18 07:32:23 <zaeph>	blawiz: Am I basic if I go for Cherry Brown? :(
Apr 18 07:33:02 <zaeph>	Back when I was gaming, I always wanted to have Reds.  All I've tried in my life are the Blues, which I had on my Razer BlackWidow for three years.  Really liked them, and actuation seems to be roughly the same as brown.
Apr 18 07:39:30 <blawiz>	i dunno if i notice much difference between switches tbh
Apr 18 07:39:46 <zaeph>	You don't feel the difference between bumped and linear?
Apr 18 07:39:52 <blawiz>	but i guess i always aimed for something unclicky, tacktile
Apr 18 07:40:09 <zaeph>	Yeah, so definitely Browns or Clears.
Apr 18 07:40:16 <zaeph>	I think Brown will be right up my alley.
Apr 18 07:40:53 <zaeph>	Plus, Ergodox are having a sale for coloured caps: https://paste.xinu.at/ojI/
Apr 18 07:41:01 <blawiz>	does ez allow for choc?
Apr 18 07:41:16 <blawiz>	i ordered a choc one nyquist
Apr 18 07:41:29 <zaeph>	Uhm, I don't think so.
Apr 18 07:42:58 <zaeph>	Jesus christ.  Looking at the review for the switches on Ergodox, it feels like I'm reading culinary reviews: https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/customize-planck
Apr 18 07:47:18 <blawiz>	maybe consider blank keycaps, since its programable :]
Apr 18 08:27:32 <zaeph>	blawiz: They don't do blank caps for the Planck EZ, sadApr 18 08:27:55 *	Disconnected ()

Apr 18 18:17:32 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I'm kinda used to spreading conversations out on IRC as many channels have people from different time zones 
Apr 18 18:17:37 <GermainZ>	Anyway nothing rong with it

Apr 18 18:56:28 <__monty__>	: / the content at zettelkasten.de is kinda disappointing tbh.
Apr 18 18:57:01 <__monty__>	I was expecting *something* because Christian Tietze has been referred to quite often in my Zettelkasten travels.
Apr 18 18:57:49 *	zaeph thinks that the other guy, the one that isn't Christian Tietze, could probably break himself in half.

Apr 18 19:03:56 <zaeph>	__monty__: I liked him better too.  I think that the German->English translation is sometimes a bit wonky.
Apr 18 19:04:00 <zaeph>	Especially for concepts.
Apr 18 19:04:08 <zaeph>	Like, they talked about buffer notes at some point, and that was super confusing.

Apr 18 19:44:55 <energizer>	why is `trash` on the list of programs that rifle will use to open a file?
Apr 18 19:45:19 <zaeph>	energizer: Because `r` is not `open`, but `run`.
Apr 18 19:45:31 <zaeph>	So, trashing is a sort of action to be run.
Apr 18 19:47:35 <energizer>	so if i press enter on a file it might get deleted?
Apr 18 19:47:44 <energizer>	well, moved to trash?
Apr 18 19:48:07 <zaeph>	energizer: It's not the default action, normally.
Apr 18 19:52:43 <energizer>	ok
Apr 18 19:53:09 <zaeph>	You could remove the action if you don't want it.  You'd have to look into your rifle.conf.
Apr 18 19:56:24 <__monty__>	energizer: It shouldn't be the default action for anything. It's even under "run as binary" which has been the least prioritised action since ranger's inception.
Apr 18 19:57:03 <__monty__>	Keep in mind that the indices of that list are currently sometimes fucked. So if you try to run the action above trash you might end up trashing.
Apr 18 19:57:20 <energizer>	alright, sounds good. it's never happened to me, i just noticed it and was curious
Apr 18 19:57:25 <__monty__>	Also keep in mind that trash means "move to trash" it doesn't actually delete a file.
Apr 18 20:38:45 <zaeph>	__monty__: Let me know how you like neuron.  Looked at the GH page and the website, and it looks quite interesting.
Apr 18 20:39:37 <__monty__>	Oh, zaeph, forgot to answer your question. Only two things worth sharing: https://sociologica.unibo.it/article/view/8350/8270 best description of Luhmann and his Zettelkasten I've come across outside of the first article that got us started. And http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2018/12/it-needs-wiki-like-superpower.html (not the original source for this post, which the good parts been quoted of anyway) 
Apr 18 20:39:43 <__monty__>	which we talked about.
Apr 18 20:39:49 <__monty__>	Was typing that up : )
Apr 18 20:40:14 <__monty__>	Everything else I marked either #meh or #ni.
Apr 18 20:40:22 <zaeph>	I approve of the #ni.
Apr 18 20:40:30 <__monty__>	: D
Apr 18 20:40:45 <zaeph>	I'd get you a nice shrubbery if I had one to spare.
Apr 18 20:41:29 <__monty__>	Then you must cut down the *mightiest* tree in this forrest...
Apr 18 20:41:31 <zaeph>	'The Fabrication of Serendipity': great subtitle, really.
Apr 18 20:41:37 <__monty__>	... with a *herring*!

Apr 18 20:41:44 <__monty__>	ツ
Apr 18 20:41:47 <__monty__>	<.<
Apr 18 20:42:36 <zaeph>	Don't get me started on 'it'.
Apr 18 20:43:33 <zaeph>	I'll have a read at your two articles tomorrow.  Gonna do some piano now.
Apr 18 20:43:47 <zaeph>	…'Play' probably makes more sense in English.
Apr 18 20:43:52 <zaeph>	Let's just settle on 'practise'.
Apr 18 20:45:18 <__monty__>	So you're not one of those weirdoes who "do" their pianos? Good.
Apr 18 20:45:38 <__monty__>	Cause I'm picturing a keyboard cover slamming shut 😬
Apr 18 20:46:04 <zaeph>	Yuck.
Apr 18 20:46:11 <__monty__>	Or if you're really fancy, a soundbox, whathever the boxy bit of a grand piano's called, cover.
Apr 18 20:46:31 <zaeph>	I actually don't know if there's a name for that.
Apr 18 20:47:13 <zaeph>	Fall board, apparently: https://lh5.ggpht.com/-XWlT0_DyJxY/UOcS5DCglgI/AAAAAAAAAGI/LrfVBYSWr8g/s9000/PianoParts.png
Apr 18 20:50:40 <zaeph>	Swear to god, this book is goddamn torture: https://paste.xinu.at/LDfM8D/
Apr 18 20:51:49 <zaeph>	Sight-reading stuff.
Apr 18 21:03:16 <zaeph>	Whoops, sorry, had to reboot the server.  One of my seeding disk had failed.
Apr 18 21:03:21 <zaeph>	(disks*)
Apr 18 21:03:39 <zaeph>	I'm really gonna have to go through conversation therapy to stop forgetting my Ss all the time.
Apr 18 21:04:19 <__monty__>	Seeding disks?
Apr 18 21:04:48 <zaeph>	Bad terminology.  A hard-drive where I keep some of the torrents I'm seeding.
Apr 18 21:05:29 <zaeph>	But it's a janky setup.  The HD is external and needs power, so when there's an outage, it's SOL.
Apr 18 21:06:14 <zaeph>	And sometimes, since it's encrypted, cryptsetup doesn't exit gracefully and doesn't want to release the /dev/sdX, which causes problems with seeding locations.
Apr 18 21:13:09 <__monty__>	Oh, snap. You dare use encryption in France?
Apr 18 21:13:16 <__monty__>	You know that's illegal, right?
Apr 18 21:16:32 <zaeph>	They can rubberhose me as much as they like, they aren't getting my Shakespeare plays.
Apr 18 21:16:43 <zaeph>	I went through blood, sweat, and tear to get them.
Apr 18 21:19:03 <zaeph>	Holy shit, Linus got a beard?!
Apr 18 21:19:20 <__monty__>	Wow, you haven't been paying attention.
Apr 18 21:19:38 <zaeph>	I've actually taken a couple of months off LTT.
Apr 18 21:19:55 <zaeph>	Suits him pretty well. 👍
Apr 18 21:20:05 <__monty__>	Best part is WAN show anyway.
Apr 18 21:20:13 <__monty__>	So you're not that many videos behind.
Apr 18 21:20:20 <__monty__>	I don't like the beard tbh.
Apr 18 21:20:29 <zaeph>	Tell you what, I haven't watched any of their WAN shows.
Apr 18 21:20:40 <__monty__>	Seriously?
Apr 18 21:20:41 <zaeph>	I like it, but it's because I'm a bearded tit myself.
Apr 18 21:20:44 <zaeph>	Yeah. :(
Apr 18 21:21:10 <__monty__>	Then why even watch them?
Apr 18 21:21:12 <zaeph>	I kind of stumbled upon LTT randomly, and the long format didn't really appeal to me.  Mind you, I don't mind watching 4h video-essays on the Witcher 3. -.-
Apr 18 21:21:23 <__monty__>	Since luke stopped hosting they haven't made many fun videos.
Apr 18 21:21:29 <zaeph>	Mostly for the cool tech reviews.  Also maranthoned their old videos about weird setups.
Apr 18 21:22:09 <zaeph>	All right, I'll consider giving WAN a shot, then.  Not right now, though.
Apr 18 21:24:18 <zaeph>	And how dare you not like the beard.
Apr 18 21:24:28 <zaeph>	I'd do him.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v71vugKdkO4

Apr 19 12:51:23 <__monty__>	Toxmi: So, to recap. Ranger's yy/pp has the *same* behavior as cp -r here?
Apr 19 12:53:10 <Toxmi>	__monty__:I think the exact is `cp ../../A . -r` in that case. But ranger do it in any way of copy/pasting I think
Apr 19 12:53:34 <Toxmi>	Here the base folder structure is A/B
Apr 19 12:54:06 <Toxmi>	cp complain : cannot copy a directory, '../../A', into itself, './A'
Apr 19 12:54:14 <Toxmi>	but it did the inifnite sufolder anyway
Apr 19 12:54:53 <__monty__>	It did?
Apr 19 12:54:57 <__monty__>	Weird.
Apr 19 12:55:12 <Toxmi>	__monty__:yes. I test it on both NTFS and Btrfs
Apr 19 12:55:20 <__monty__>	Nice, thanks.
Apr 19 12:55:32 <__monty__>	Makes me consider this 'not-a-bug'.
Apr 19 12:55:49 <Toxmi>	__monty__:I think it's bcz of cp not ranger
Apr 19 12:57:09 <__monty__>	Ranger doesn't shell out to cp.
Apr 19 12:57:21 <__monty__>	So we reimplemented the same behavior.
Apr 19 12:59:25 <Toxmi>	__monty__:ah, I thought it uses cp
Apr 19 13:00:54 <Toxmi>	I just test it with lf as well and it has the same behavior
Apr 19 13:03:30 <__monty__>	lf?
Apr 19 13:11:31 <Toxmi>	__monty__:oh realy, you don't know about lf? it's your competitor :D
Apr 19 13:11:51 <Toxmi>	ranger bring everything to python, and they're trying to bring it back to shell :D
Apr 19 13:12:01 <__monty__>	Oh, that lf.
Apr 19 13:13:14 <Toxmi>	__monty__:However, I double check it again and seems cp works find and doesn't do infinite recurse. But ranger and lf do
Apr 19 13:13:32 <__monty__>	Ah, crap.
Apr 19 13:13:41 <__monty__>	That's what I figured might happen.
Apr 19 13:13:47 <__monty__>	Could you open an issue?
Apr 19 13:14:26 <__monty__>	Not saying this'll get fixed any time soon but better to have a record so it might get fixed at some point.
Apr 19 13:14:33 <__monty__>	I thought lf was C?
Apr 19 13:15:14 <Toxmi>	I don't know what I did before, but I did it couple of time with cp and it didn't go infinite
Apr 19 13:15:19 <Toxmi>	__monty__:Sure
Apr 19 13:15:32 <__monty__>	If I moved to anything it'd have to be written either in Rust or Haskell.
Apr 19 13:33:28 <Toxmi>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/issues/1925
Apr 19 13:34:39 <__monty__>	Thanks!
Apr 19 13:35:37 <Toxmi>	anytime
Apr 19 17:13:16 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)
Apr 19 17:13:28 <zaeph>	Oh hi grobi!  It's been a while!
Apr 19 17:13:33 <zaeph>	How are you?
Apr 19 17:13:53 <grobi>	still healthy and you?
Apr 19 17:14:24 <zaeph>	Same here.  A bit anxious at the idea of returning to school on 11 May, but things might change by then.  Have they asked you to go back to school yet on your end?
Apr 19 17:15:03 <vifon>	Wasn't grobi already working?
Apr 19 17:16:16 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, you're right.
Apr 19 17:16:31 <grobi>	we are still waiting  to go back to school, i'm still helping in our communities for people with disabilities..
Apr 19 17:17:12 <zaeph>	All right.  I hope everything things will be fine for you.
Apr 19 17:17:26 <grobi>	so if one of the staff is coughing, i get in place
Apr 19 17:17:45 <vifon>	Oh, this kind of deal.
Apr 19 17:18:05 <vifon>	Take extra care of yourself, grobi.
Apr 19 17:18:15 <grobi>	not really... ;) i#m in urgent need for a 
Apr 19 17:18:17 <zaeph>	They'll have us teach at school with masks here.
Apr 19 17:18:25 <zaeph>	We have no idea how this is going to work.
Apr 19 17:18:37 <grobi>	hint of yours, guys
Apr 19 17:18:40 <zaeph>	Our government is talking on the TV right now.  They're giving a sitrep.
Apr 19 17:18:46 <zaeph>	Ask away!
Apr 19 17:19:06 <vifon>	Just talking in a mask is awful.
Apr 19 17:19:14 <vifon>	Teaching?  For a few hours?  They must be joking.
Apr 19 17:19:21 <zaeph>	vifon: Now imagine doing phonology with masks.
Apr 19 17:19:28 <zaeph>	Now imagine doing group works with masks.
Apr 19 17:19:40 <zaeph>	English class is going to be even more of a joke than it already is. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 19 17:20:41 <grobi>	i used a live usb image with two persistence storages (partitition) after i idiotically upgraded one of them it turned into read-only
Apr 19 17:21:07 <zaeph>	The partition, you mean?
Apr 19 17:22:05 <zaeph>	It might be an ownership problem.
Apr 19 17:22:13 <grobi>	now i wanted to delete the partition and to format the stick once again , but i can't dellete the read-only :(
Apr 19 17:22:52 <grobi>	is there any software able to format anyway?
Apr 19 17:23:51 <grobi>	probaly i need to use a window-mashine, i guess
Apr 19 17:23:52 <zaeph>	grobi: You should be able to delete the partition if you're root.  Are you sure you're not doing it as your user, and not as root?
Apr 19 17:25:02 <grobi>	i tried both: from my user-acount with sudo and logged into my root-account both are the same...
Apr 19 17:25:26 <grobi>	the partition was luks-encrypted before as well BTW
Apr 19 17:25:27 <zaeph>	Have you been able to unmount the partition first?
Apr 19 17:25:55 <grobi>	i can't even mount it
Apr 19 17:26:03 <zaeph>	It might have something to do with cryptsetup.  You need to unmount, `cryptsetup close $name_of_decrypted_partition`, and then you should be able to do it.
Apr 19 17:26:11 <zaeph>	You have to force the umount, then.
Apr 19 17:26:13 <grobi>	probably because of the encryption
Apr 19 17:26:17 <zaeph>	Oh wait, sorry, misread.
Apr 19 17:26:38 <zaeph>	Try `sudo cryptsetup close <tab-complete>`.
Apr 19 17:26:59 <grobi>	can it be that you cant decrypt in read-only mode?
Apr 19 17:27:17 <zaeph>	Decrypting doesn't imply writing anything, so it shouldn't be a problem.
Apr 19 17:27:44 <grobi>	ah ja i'll try that, wait :)
Apr 19 17:28:39 <grobi>	what is <tab-complete> for?
Apr 19 17:29:13 <zaeph>	Because you might not know the name of the device.
Apr 19 17:29:18 <zaeph>	So just press <Tab>.
Apr 19 17:30:58 <grobi>	sdb3
Apr 19 17:31:05 <zaeph>	I have to go slice my 'tatoes.  __monty__, vifon, can you take over helping grobi?  Problem with a read-only LUKS partition that won't let him wipe.
Apr 19 17:31:10 <zaeph>	Did it do anything?
Apr 19 17:31:37 <vifon>	D:
Apr 19 17:33:42 <grobi>	it says sdb3 is not active
Apr 19 17:34:16 <__monty__>	Don't have any experience with LUKS partitions.
Apr 19 17:34:37 <__monty__>	Wouldn't be surprised if the USB stick is just borked though.
Apr 19 17:35:13 <grobi>	i'm afraid too :(
Apr 19 17:45:37 <grobi>	i will try out the live-system from another usb-drive maybe i can deete it from there...
Apr 19 17:45:47 <grobi>	see you soon :)
Apr 19 19:34:34 <rnmhdn>	__monty__:
Apr 19 19:35:02 <rnmhdn>	duolingo stories are so weird to me
Apr 19 19:35:02 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: what are those?
Apr 19 19:35:02 <rnmhdn>	how would you describe them?
Apr 19 19:35:17 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: it's a language learning app that me and __monty__  use for learning french
Apr 19 19:35:17 <rnmhdn>	there are some stories in it that you read
Apr 19 19:35:17 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: I know what Duolingo is. What are duolingo stories? Sounds like a new story
Apr 19 19:35:17 <GermainZ>	feature*
Apr 19 19:35:37 <rnmhdn>	I'ts not so new
Apr 19 19:35:37 <rnmhdn>	but it's only available on the website
Apr 19 19:35:37 <rnmhdn>	not the app
Apr 19 19:35:49 <GermainZ>	Ah that explains it
Apr 19 19:35:49 <rnmhdn>	iirc you speak french pretty well
Apr 19 19:35:49 <GermainZ>	Yeah
Apr 19 19:35:49 <rnmhdn>	I think you were actually at least half french no?
Apr 19 19:36:14 <rnmhdn>	zaeph: also speaks french
Apr 19 19:36:18 <GermainZ>	No, but French is my 2nd language and I learned that since I was very young
Apr 19 19:36:18 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: asks their questions from zaeph 
Apr 19 19:36:43 <GermainZ>	Although I'm out of practice now as I haven't spoken much for about 7 or 8 years
Apr 19 19:36:49 <rnmhdn>	maybe he can ask you too :P
Apr 19 19:36:49 <GermainZ>	So my writing skills have went down a lot
Apr 19 19:36:49 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: oh that's a pity
Apr 19 19:36:49 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: 2nd as in 2nd best 
Apr 19 19:37:21 <rnmhdn>	or 2nd in order of learning
Apr 19 19:37:47 <GermainZ>	Order of learning
Apr 19 19:37:47 <GermainZ>	Arabic is my mother tongue
Apr 19 19:37:47 <GermainZ>	I think I started learning French when I was 3
Apr 19 19:38:04 <rnmhdn>	your were half blood right?
Apr 19 19:38:04 <GermainZ>	Half blood?
Apr 19 19:38:04 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: I know you are lebanese 
Apr 19 19:38:17 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: like one of your parents is french
Apr 19 19:38:17 <GermainZ>	Like Snape?
Apr 19 19:38:38 <GermainZ>	Oh, no. Both are Lebanese
Apr 19 19:38:52 <rnmhdn>	actually, I'm sorry to disclose your ethnicity without your permission
Apr 19 19:38:52 <rnmhdn>	I hope you don't mind
Apr 19 19:38:52 <GermainZ>	It's alright
Apr 19 19:38:52 <rnmhdn>	I also remember you are not into politics :))
Apr 19 19:39:32 <rnmhdn>	half-blood is not the right term
Apr 19 19:39:32 <rnmhdn>	hybrid?
Apr 19 19:39:45 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 19:39:45 <rnmhdn>	what is the correct term?
Apr 19 19:39:45 <__monty__>	Huh, I've always assumed GermainZ to be German. Due to the name.
Apr 19 19:39:45 <GermainZ>	__monty__: Germain is my name
Apr 19 19:40:01 <rnmhdn>	It's a french name
Apr 19 19:40:01 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: why did you learn french?
Apr 19 19:40:38 <__monty__>	TIL
Apr 19 19:40:38 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: I don't think there is a word. There is one for different races tho, it's just "mixed origin"
Apr 19 19:40:38 <rnmhdn>	do you leave in Beirute?
Apr 19 19:40:48 <GermainZ>	No
Apr 19 19:40:48 <rnmhdn>	live*
Apr 19 19:41:03 <GermainZ>	French is very popular in Lebanon. You'll learn it in many schools. Same with English
Apr 19 19:41:05 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: I translated from my mother language verbatim
Apr 19 19:41:05 <__monty__>	Good to know someone who speaks arabic though. Definitely interested in the script. Too many languages to pick it up currently though.
Apr 19 19:41:24 <rnmhdn>	Here we call it two-vained
Apr 19 19:41:58 <rnmhdn>	__monty__:it won't be as easy as learning latin languages tho:P
Apr 19 19:42:07 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: how do you find duolingo stories from a cultural standpoint?
Apr 19 19:42:07 <__monty__>	No, of course.
Apr 19 19:42:21 <GermainZ>	__monty__: happy to help :)
Apr 19 19:42:33 <rnmhdn>	Actually I'd love to learn Arabic too:P
Apr 19 19:42:46 <rnmhdn>	I know some ofc
Apr 19 19:43:03 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: a month ago I did a lecture at AUB
Apr 19 19:43:16 <rnmhdn>	over this skype thing
Apr 19 19:43:16 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: what about?
Apr 19 19:43:16 <rnmhdn>	cisco webex
Apr 19 19:43:16 <__monty__>	Wouldn't really try actually learning it, just the basics. Same for chinese.
Apr 19 19:43:27 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: Blockchain Urbanism:))
Apr 19 19:43:48 <rnmhdn>	__monty__:I don't think I will learn chinese but hopefuly I will become fluent in arabic some day
Apr 19 19:44:10 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: what are the benefits of using a blockchain for that?
Apr 19 19:44:29 <rnmhdn>	it was about bottom up stuff
Apr 19 19:44:51 <rnmhdn>	it was about a studio we have at TUIC
Apr 19 19:45:01 <rnmhdn>	Tehran Urban Innovation Center
Apr 19 19:45:24 <rnmhdn>	which is about bottom up revitalization of urban leftover spaces
Apr 19 19:45:49 <rnmhdn>	the point of using blockchain was ofc being "decentralized"
Apr 19 19:46:03 <__monty__>	Tehran, that's Iran, right?
Apr 19 19:46:03 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: ya
Apr 19 19:46:43 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: sounds like overengineering to me TBH
Apr 19 19:46:57 <rnmhdn>	yeah
Apr 19 19:46:57 <rnmhdn>	to me too
Apr 19 19:46:57 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 19:46:57 <__monty__>	How's Covid hitting you guys?
Apr 19 19:46:57 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 19:46:57 <rnmhdn>	The director of the lab
Apr 19 19:47:18 <rnmhdn>	is a GSD graduate...
Apr 19 19:47:18 <rnmhdn>	so
Apr 19 19:47:27 <rnmhdn>	we have to do some scientific bulshitting
Apr 19 19:47:27 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 19:47:53 <GermainZ>	Must be fun having a German Shepard as a director
Apr 19 19:48:09 <rnmhdn>	google GSD graduate
Apr 19 19:48:09 <rnmhdn>	instead of GSD
Apr 19 19:48:09 <rnmhdn>	:P
Apr 19 19:48:36 <GermainZ>	Geneva School of Diplomacy?
Apr 19 19:48:50 <rnmhdn>	no
Apr 19 19:48:57 <GermainZ>	Graduate School of Design?
Apr 19 19:49:01 <rnmhdn>	Harvard Graduate School of Design
Apr 19 19:49:01 <rnmhdn>	ya
Apr 19 19:49:43 <rnmhdn>	so
Apr 19 19:50:04 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: how would you sociologically evaluage duolingo stories?
Apr 19 19:50:24 <__monty__>	Not sure what you mean?
Apr 19 19:50:34 <rnmhdn>	aren't they too cheesy and romance centered and crappy?
Apr 19 19:50:48 <__monty__>	They're very simplistic stories that are supposed to be understandable with very little language understanding.
Apr 19 19:50:59 <rnmhdn>	for instance right now I was practicing this story
Apr 19 19:50:59 <rnmhdn>	which was about sb who has broken up
Apr 19 19:51:21 <rnmhdn>	and then three days after that they were going to this thing called
Apr 19 19:51:30 <rnmhdn>	Soirée pour célibataires
Apr 19 19:51:49 <rnmhdn>	to find a new boyfriend to accompany them to their sister's wedding
Apr 19 19:52:38 <rnmhdn>	Is that a common pattern?
Apr 19 19:52:48 <__monty__>	The stories aren't supposed to be hard. They're supposed to be understandable with a very limited knowledge of the language. The topics are your generic, interesting enough to read but not much more than that kind of fodder.
Apr 19 19:54:04 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: To me it kinda seems like the stories have some sort of curtural agenda
Apr 19 19:54:45 <rnmhdn>	I don't know maybe it's because our culture is so different
Apr 19 19:55:09 <__monty__>	Agenda?
Apr 19 19:55:15 <rnmhdn>	as in they are biased towards certain cultural choices
Apr 19 19:55:16 <rnmhdn>	that are not neccesserly global
Apr 19 19:55:30 <__monty__>	I mean, probably? They're an american company.
Apr 19 19:55:30 <rnmhdn>	So
Apr 19 19:56:09 <rnmhdn>	you would say that the culture behind those stories is more close to USA culture than EU culture right?
Apr 19 19:56:34 <__monty__>	Probably, though we don't frown on trying to find someone to go to a wedding with.
Apr 19 19:56:34 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: Is it only america that is so extroverted about their culture or is it like that for every other country?
Apr 19 19:57:04 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: My concern was the distance from the previous relationship
Apr 19 19:57:54 <rnmhdn>	I don't think it's a good idea to go in a new relationship 3 days after breaking one
Apr 19 19:57:54 <rnmhdn>	but like
Apr 19 19:57:54 <rnmhdn>	4 stories out of 10 are about dating
Apr 19 19:57:54 <rnmhdn>	and that is waaaay too much for me
Apr 19 19:58:01 <__monty__>	They might be more so. I think you're only noticing it because of the contrast though.
Apr 19 19:58:01 <rnmhdn>	I don't think the only way to write up something with simple language would be to write about dating
Apr 19 19:58:41 <__monty__>	It's not.
Apr 19 19:58:41 <__monty__>	But a large part of the duolingo demographic probably likes it.
Apr 19 19:58:41 <__monty__>	Teens and women.
Apr 19 19:58:49 <__monty__>	No one forces you to read the stories I guess.
Apr 19 19:58:49 <rnmhdn>	I always considered preteens to be a large part of duolingo demographic
Apr 19 19:58:55 <rnmhdn>	but I don't have stats
Apr 19 19:58:55 <__monty__>	Though on the other hand maybe consider it a mind opening exercise?
Apr 19 19:59:43 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: actually at the beginning I found it super cool
Apr 19 19:59:55 <rnmhdn>	because among the very first stories there were some with gay ppl
Apr 19 20:00:03 <rnmhdn>	and gay marriage
Apr 19 20:00:03 <rnmhdn>	and also it's filled with people of color
Apr 19 20:00:31 <rnmhdn>	and it has also nice things about how every job matters and how it can be valid to wish to be a waitress
Apr 19 20:00:31 <__monty__>	Yeah, the people of color thing stood out to me.
Apr 19 20:00:50 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: but the gay marriages didn't?
Apr 19 20:00:50 <rnmhdn>	that is interesting
Apr 19 20:00:58 <rnmhdn>	I'm happy to hear that:D
Apr 19 20:01:26 <__monty__>	Not so much. Probably because gay people are more common here?
Apr 19 20:01:36 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: yeah
Apr 19 20:01:46 <rnmhdn>	but gay marriage is not that common in the media
Apr 19 20:02:31 <__monty__>	Depends on the media, cf. american media : )
Apr 19 20:02:37 <rnmhdn>	anyway, In my culture, if you want to write stories that have many preteens in their audience 
Apr 19 20:02:44 <rnmhdn>	you won't gi with 50+% dating stories
Apr 19 20:02:57 <rnmhdn>	cf?
Apr 19 20:03:06 <__monty__>	Conferatur/refer.
Apr 19 20:03:25 <rnmhdn>	can you elaborate on that sentence?
Apr 19 20:03:37 <rnmhdn>	u mean
Apr 19 20:03:50 <rnmhdn>	its common in american medai
Apr 19 20:04:02 <rnmhdn>	media* but not the media of other countries?
Apr 19 20:04:37 <__monty__>	Legalization of gay marriage is a controversial topic in the US.
Apr 19 20:04:37 <__monty__>	So it's a common news topic.
Apr 19 20:05:07 <rnmhdn>	so
Apr 19 20:05:07 <rnmhdn>	overal
Apr 19 20:05:07 <__monty__>	It's been legal here for a long time so it's never on the news.
Apr 19 20:05:26 <rnmhdn>	60% of stories being about dating
Apr 19 20:05:26 <rnmhdn>	is kinda normal to you
Apr 19 20:05:26 <__monty__>	It *is* controversial in Spain though.
Apr 19 20:05:37 <rnmhdn>	and won't catch the eye of a typical eurupian right?
Apr 19 20:05:47 <__monty__>	Not normal, it seems a bit focused on teenage girls tbh.
Apr 19 20:05:57 <__monty__>	But I don't care about the contents of the stories.
Apr 19 20:05:57 <rnmhdn>	I know
Apr 19 20:06:14 <GermainZ>	It sounds like they just looked at the demographics and aimed stories at that
Apr 19 20:06:28 <GermainZ>	Also I suppose dating stories have more chances to get interesting vocab rather than landscape stories
Apr 19 20:07:14 <rnmhdn>	also
Apr 19 20:07:14 <rnmhdn>	another story that totally 
Apr 19 20:07:14 <rnmhdn>	like
Apr 19 20:07:14 <rnmhdn>	tooootally cought my eye
Apr 19 20:07:23 <rnmhdn>	was the guy who had a "surprise"
Apr 19 20:07:23 <rnmhdn>	for his mom
Apr 19 20:07:35 <rnmhdn>	which was his marriage to some girl her mom hadn't even met once
Apr 19 20:07:35 <rnmhdn>	like
Apr 19 20:07:46 <rnmhdn>	that was suuuuper weird to me
Apr 19 20:08:07 <GermainZ>	I wouldn't take these stories as a strong reflection of any culture
Apr 19 20:08:07 <rnmhdn>	I'd say 1 in every 50000 iranians marry like that
Apr 19 20:08:24 <__monty__>	That's not common here either.
Apr 19 20:08:24 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: don't you think it can have influence on teens?
Apr 19 20:08:28 <__monty__>	It's just a sensational story. To the mind of a teenage girl.
Apr 19 20:08:35 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: do you frown at it?
Apr 19 20:08:48 <__monty__>	No, like I said I don't care about the contents.
Apr 19 20:08:52 <GermainZ>	Not really, no. Or to put it in another way: if it does have a strong influence, there's a much bigger issue at play
Apr 19 20:08:56 <__monty__>	I don't think it shapes anyone's mind.
Apr 19 20:09:01 <GermainZ>	(in the kid's environment)
Apr 19 20:09:21 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: what much bigger issue?
Apr 19 20:09:21 <__monty__>	You'd have to be pretty weak minded to really be influenced by such stories.
Apr 19 20:09:50 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: no human interaction or mental illness?
Apr 19 20:09:50 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: do you think friends and simillar TV series influence ppl?
Apr 19 20:10:08 <__monty__>	Not really, no.
Apr 19 20:10:13 <rnmhdn>	well
Apr 19 20:10:30 <rnmhdn>	it has had a huuuuuuuuuuge impact on iranian culture
Apr 19 20:10:49 <__monty__>	I suspect you're looking at this from a religious perspective? I.e., with a value judgement attached?
Apr 19 20:10:54 <GermainZ>	__monty__: I think there is certainly influence depending on your culture. But that's no different from meeting new people
Apr 19 20:10:54 <rnmhdn>	I can imagine that it doesn't have much of an impact on eurupian people
Apr 19 20:11:27 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: you mean like you think I'm a religious person
Apr 19 20:11:27 <rnmhdn>	?
Apr 19 20:11:51 <__monty__>	Sure.
Apr 19 20:12:01 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: I could assure you that I'm pretty much anything but religious
Apr 19 20:12:05 <rnmhdn>	but I do have value judgements attached
Apr 19 20:12:38 <rnmhdn>	In fact I believe most psychologist would totally agree that going to speed dating 3 days after a break up
Apr 19 20:12:48 <rnmhdn>	is a very unhealthy behavior
Apr 19 20:12:59 <__monty__>	And you don't think those were influenced by your parents'/environment's religioN?
Apr 19 20:12:59 <rnmhdn>	or not having your mom know you are getting married
Apr 19 20:13:28 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: of course everybody is affected by their environment
Apr 19 20:13:28 <__monty__>	Depends on the relationships.
Apr 19 20:13:50 <rnmhdn>	but there is noone with a religion that has a blood relation with me
Apr 19 20:14:02 <rnmhdn>	except for my great grand father
Apr 19 20:14:28 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: a relationship that would be fine to discuss with pre teens?
Apr 19 20:15:04 <__monty__>	I thought atheism was pretty much banned from Iran after the sordid ordeal with the US and the Shah?
Apr 19 20:15:14 <rnmhdn>	well
Apr 19 20:15:14 <rnmhdn>	Iran is a very strange country
Apr 19 20:15:22 <rnmhdn>	it's a very two sides country
Apr 19 20:15:33 <rnmhdn>	everyone has two lives
Apr 19 20:15:41 <rnmhdn>	there is a huge gap between the inside and outside
Apr 19 20:15:59 <__monty__>	I've read Persepolis.
Apr 19 20:16:07 <rnmhdn>	I've seen the movie
Apr 19 20:16:18 <__monty__>	Not sure if that's an accurate representation?
Apr 19 20:16:29 <rnmhdn>	I don't exactly remember it 
Apr 19 20:16:40 <rnmhdn>	but it's pretty much inaccurate at least for today
Apr 19 20:16:52 <rnmhdn>	it might have been accurate 40 years ago
Apr 19 20:16:52 <rnmhdn>	but definately not today
Apr 19 20:17:04 <__monty__>	Well I assumed Iran wasn't frozen in time : )
Apr 19 20:17:31 <rnmhdn>	I don't know what is persepolis tho
Apr 19 20:17:43 <rnmhdn>	is it the movie about that girl?
Apr 19 20:17:43 <rnmhdn>	who was in austria or smth?
Apr 19 20:17:58 <__monty__>	Yeah, I read the graphic novel.
Apr 19 20:18:11 <rnmhdn>	I see
Apr 19 20:18:29 <rnmhdn>	well it's for 2000s
Apr 19 20:18:29 <__monty__>	I assume america's not very well liked anymore? Maybe including Western Europe/
Apr 19 20:18:29 <__monty__>	*?
Apr 19 20:18:48 <rnmhdn>	well
Apr 19 20:19:04 <rnmhdn>	Trump made a huge difference
Apr 19 20:19:12 <rnmhdn>	I had some of my friends burning US flags because of him
Apr 19 20:19:28 <__monty__>	So not all the meddling the US has done in the Middle East the past decade?
Apr 19 20:19:38 <rnmhdn>	from communist groups
Apr 19 20:19:53 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: well
Apr 19 20:20:05 <rnmhdn>	no everyone is aware of the untold history of the united states here
Apr 19 20:20:27 <rnmhdn>	there is certainly much less negative feelings towards EU 
Apr 19 20:20:38 <rnmhdn>	It's say
Apr 19 20:21:08 <rnmhdn>	overall US is hated 7
Apr 19 20:21:24 <rnmhdn>	our regime is hated 7 too
Apr 19 20:21:38 <rnmhdn>	saudi arabia and isreal 8
Apr 19 20:21:47 <rnmhdn>	france and UK 4-5
Apr 19 20:22:01 <GermainZ>	Lebanon?
Apr 19 20:22:14 <rnmhdn>	russia and china 2-3
Apr 19 20:22:24 <GermainZ>	Probably doesn't register :D
Apr 19 20:22:24 <rnmhdn>	well
Apr 19 20:22:40 <rnmhdn>	there is certainly a lot of slogans going on against lebanon on the streets
Apr 19 20:22:55 <rnmhdn>	but no hard feelings
Apr 19 20:22:55 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:22:55 <rnmhdn>	ofc nobody hates lebanon here
Apr 19 20:23:26 <rnmhdn>	but many ppl think that the country is sending all our money to lebanon and iraq and syria and phalastine
Apr 19 20:23:26 <rnmhdn>	so
Apr 19 20:23:35 <rnmhdn>	we have slogans against that 
Apr 19 20:23:35 <rnmhdn>	like, don't send our money to lebanon, we are starvng ourselves
Apr 19 20:24:26 <rnmhdn>	I have a small negative feeling towards lebanon personally
Apr 19 20:24:26 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:24:26 <rnmhdn>	becasue the ex of one my exes was lebanese
Apr 19 20:24:39 <rnmhdn>	and he treated her so bad
Apr 19 20:24:39 <rnmhdn>	:)))
Apr 19 20:24:57 <rnmhdn>	so I'm often reminded of him
Apr 19 20:25:22 <rnmhdn>	but overall ofc nobody hates lebanon here
Apr 19 20:25:22 <GermainZ>	we're too inconsequential to hate
Apr 19 20:25:36 <GermainZ>	:p
Apr 19 20:25:36 <GermainZ>	rnmhdn: how do people get/drink alcohol? (I know it's officially banned and illegal)
Apr 19 20:25:37 <rnmhdn>	too humble, yes
Apr 19 20:25:37 <rnmhdn>	:P
Apr 19 20:25:37 <rnmhdn>	well
Apr 19 20:25:46 <rnmhdn>	many people make their own
Apr 19 20:26:01 <rnmhdn>	we buy like 2-3 tonns of grape every year
Apr 19 20:26:15 <rnmhdn>	in my family
Apr 19 20:26:15 <rnmhdn>	lol
Apr 19 20:26:15 <rnmhdn>	iran is super funny
Apr 19 20:26:24 <rnmhdn>	there are some totally legal places
Apr 19 20:26:37 <rnmhdn>	that sell grape juice
Apr 19 20:26:46 <rnmhdn>	they take the juice out of the grape in front of you
Apr 19 20:26:58 <rnmhdn>	ready for making wine
Apr 19 20:27:24 <rnmhdn>	and everybody knows why everyone else is buying all these barrels of grape juice
Apr 19 20:27:24 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:27:34 <rnmhdn>	it's pretty funny
Apr 19 20:27:34 <rnmhdn>	and also many people make beer
Apr 19 20:28:00 <rnmhdn>	you can buy alcoholless bears from supermarkets
Apr 19 20:28:17 <rnmhdn>	and then you buy yeast from bakeries
Apr 19 20:28:31 <GermainZ>	hehe
Apr 19 20:28:31 <rnmhdn>	and put some sugare and mix
Apr 19 20:28:31 <rnmhdn>	:D
Apr 19 20:28:31 <GermainZ>	and what about parties with friends?
Apr 19 20:28:31 <GermainZ>	do those happen at home?
Apr 19 20:28:31 <rnmhdn>	lol
Apr 19 20:28:43 <rnmhdn>	cmon man
Apr 19 20:28:43 <rnmhdn>	ofc
Apr 19 20:28:43 <rnmhdn>	all the time
Apr 19 20:28:43 <rnmhdn>	lol
Apr 19 20:28:55 <GermainZ>	but only at home?
Apr 19 20:28:55 <rnmhdn>	yeah sure
Apr 19 20:28:55 <rnmhdn>	3 years ago
Apr 19 20:29:13 <GermainZ>	and you're not afraid someone might snitch if they have a grudge?
Apr 19 20:29:25 <rnmhdn>	once it was the anniversary of Khomeini's death
Apr 19 20:29:25 <rnmhdn>	so it was a small holiday
Apr 19 20:29:37 <rnmhdn>	and we had a party
Apr 19 20:29:37 <rnmhdn>	and I was crazy drunk
Apr 19 20:29:37 <rnmhdn>	I went out of the house at 11:30
Apr 19 20:29:54 <rnmhdn>	with socks
Apr 19 20:29:54 <rnmhdn>	and shorts
Apr 19 20:29:54 <rnmhdn>	and tshirt
Apr 19 20:29:54 <rnmhdn>	and a tie
Apr 19 20:29:54 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:30:11 <rnmhdn>	I went in the street
Apr 19 20:30:33 <rnmhdn>	to the middle of a park nearby and found my girlfriend who was failing to find the address and took her to the party
Apr 19 20:30:33 <rnmhdn>	and at that time
Apr 19 20:30:49 <rnmhdn>	around midnight
Apr 19 20:31:02 <rnmhdn>	every 5 minutes you could see 10-20 people coming out of a house saying goodbye to eachother
Apr 19 20:31:14 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: 40 years ago that would happen
Apr 19 20:31:14 <rnmhdn>	that ppl would snitch eachother
Apr 19 20:31:28 <rnmhdn>	but not now
Apr 19 20:31:37 <rnmhdn>	also
Apr 19 20:31:37 <__monty__>	Barrels of grapes or metric tonnes? o.O
Apr 19 20:32:04 <rnmhdn>	__monty__: mettric tonnes
Apr 19 20:32:05 <rnmhdn>	we have a large family
Apr 19 20:32:17 <rnmhdn>	we haven't done it recently
Apr 19 20:32:17 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 20:32:29 <rnmhdn>	recently we just biu the barrels of juice
Apr 19 20:32:29 <rnmhdn>	before these shops didn't exist
Apr 19 20:32:46 <rnmhdn>	so we bought truckloads of grape
Apr 19 20:32:46 <rnmhdn>	and took the jouce by foot
Apr 19 20:32:54 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:32:54 <rnmhdn>	it was a whole festival
Apr 19 20:32:54 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 20:32:54 <rnmhdn>	such happy times:))
Apr 19 20:33:27 <rnmhdn>	about the snitching
Apr 19 20:33:42 <rnmhdn>	an important thing is that the cities are culturally segregated
Apr 19 20:34:07 <rnmhdn>	there are certain religious areas that nobody throughs such parties
Apr 19 20:34:17 <rnmhdn>	and certain other areas that everyone has like one party a week
Apr 19 20:34:51 <rnmhdn>	right now
Apr 19 20:35:01 <GermainZ>	are the alcohol rules actually enforced tho?
Apr 19 20:35:10 <rnmhdn>	we have like 50 liters of wine in my house
Apr 19 20:35:10 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: yes
Apr 19 20:35:16 <GermainZ>	or only when convenient? e.g. political dissidents 
Apr 19 20:35:16 <rnmhdn>	if they catch you they wipe your ass
Apr 19 20:35:32 <rnmhdn>	whip
Apr 19 20:35:50 <GermainZ>	lmao wipe your ass
Apr 19 20:36:02 <rnmhdn>	lol
Apr 19 20:36:44 <rnmhdn>	actually
Apr 19 20:36:52 <rnmhdn>	let me show you something interesting
Apr 19 20:36:52 <rnmhdn>	there was a recent poll
Apr 19 20:42:23 <rnmhdn>	question: which one is the best possible economical ally for Iran?
Apr 19 20:42:32 <rnmhdn>	choices:
Apr 19 20:42:54 <rnmhdn>	china, russia, USA, EU, none of the above
Apr 19 20:43:15 <rnmhdn>	guess the order
Apr 19 20:43:15 <rnmhdn>	50K people have responded
Apr 19 20:43:30 <GermainZ>	russia, china, eu, usa
Apr 19 20:43:36 <GermainZ>	I'm not gonna guess where "none of the above" is
Apr 19 20:44:15 <__monty__>	China, russia, EU, US?
Apr 19 20:44:39 <rnmhdn>	US, none, china=EU, ru
Apr 19 20:45:01 <__monty__>	Seriously?
Apr 19 20:45:01 <GermainZ>	heh
Apr 19 20:45:01 <rnmhdn>	ya
Apr 19 20:45:01 <rnmhdn>	:D
Apr 19 20:45:09 <__monty__>	Ugh, why does everyone think the US is so great?
Apr 19 20:45:26 <GermainZ>	__monty__: I guess when you're embargoed it is the best to become an ally with
Apr 19 20:45:35 <rnmhdn>	58%, 16%, 11%, 4%
Apr 19 20:45:36 <GermainZ>	since that would lift the restrictions 
Apr 19 20:45:53 <rnmhdn>	lol

Apr 19 21:26:40 <GermainZ>	Probably a good chunk of that 2h30min was spent pronouncing the word
Apr 19 21:27:03 <zaeph>	Also, unrelated: 'Germain' is a fairly old-sounding name in France, but I've known one who was a pretty good friend in my union.  Good on you for having it, I really like it. 👍
Apr 19 21:27:26 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I just say slip-box, honestly.  Can't be arsed spelling Zettelkasten properly.
Apr 19 21:27:32 <GermainZ>	Names are either super popular or old-sounding 
Apr 19 21:28:16 <rnmhdn>	mine is neither
Apr 19 21:28:44 <GermainZ>	What is it?
Apr 19 21:28:52 <zaeph>	I can think of plenty there are just middle-of-the-road.
Apr 19 21:29:35 <GermainZ>	Yeah I guess they're generational trends
Apr 19 21:29:55 <zaeph>	'Leo' is pretty cool when you remove the accent that gives away the Frechness.
Apr 19 21:30:10 <GermainZ>	Leyo
Apr 19 21:30:48 <zaeph>	They're actually fairly similar-sounding between English and French.
Apr 19 21:30:48 <GermainZ>	Is it just Leo or short for Leonardo?
Apr 19 21:30:55 <zaeph>	The vowels are not too different in quality.
Apr 19 21:31:04 <zaeph>	Just Leo.  My parents were quite pithy.
Apr 19 21:31:13 <zaeph>	Well, Léo actually, but I forgive them.
Apr 19 21:31:13 <GermainZ>	Lay-o in French, Lee-yo in English
Apr 19 21:31:23 <zaeph>	Yup.
Apr 19 21:31:31 <zaeph>	I've expunged the diacritic from most documents anyway. :p
Apr 19 21:33:21 <zaeph>	Hasn't Lebanon gone through a lot of shit lately?  Heard the youths were up in arms about the gov.
Apr 19 21:33:28 <zaeph>	Actually, heard pretty similar news coming from Tehran.
Apr 19 21:35:08 <zaeph>	Also, you'll be pleased to know that I share initials with Leonardo da Vinci.  Remember that when I get famous. ✌️
Apr 19 21:36:24 <GermainZ>	Lebanon is currently facing a huge economic crisis
Apr 19 21:36:42 <zaeph>	Just like us soon! ᕕ( ᐕ )ᕗ
Apr 19 21:36:42 <GermainZ>	That and the corruption and conditions for the last few decades lead to mass revolts in November through February
Apr 19 21:36:55 <GermainZ>	Then that calmed down a bit in part due to desperation, then Covid arrived
Apr 19 21:37:00 <GermainZ>	zaeph: not even close, no
Apr 19 21:37:32 <zaeph>	Yeah, sorry, was trying to be humourous.
Apr 19 21:37:32 <zaeph>	How are you holding up yourself?
Apr 19 21:38:28 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ:Aran
Apr 19 21:38:31 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I'm not in Lebanon so I'm less affected. My parents are tho
Apr 19 21:38:31 <GermainZ>	For now it's fine
Apr 19 21:38:48 <zaeph>	Oof.  Fingers crossed for them, I hope everything will be all right.
Apr 19 21:39:07 <GermainZ>	Hopefully :)
Apr 19 21:39:37 <zaeph>	I come from a small town in France (< 8k), but there was a family from Lebanon whose daughter was in the same grade as me.  She was always super nice.
Apr 19 21:40:27 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: oh, since when are you not in lebanon?
Apr 19 21:40:27 <GermainZ>	A couple of years or so
Apr 19 21:41:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I'd say we're nicer (people-facing wise) than the French on average due to our culture
Apr 19 21:41:29 <GermainZ>	zaeph: whereas the French (and many Europeans) are seen as colder
Apr 19 21:41:29 <zaeph>	Btw, out of mild curiosity, what are you guys doing for a living?  You already know that I'm a failed academic forced to teach highschoolers.
Apr 19 21:41:36 <GermainZ>	I'm doing an Msc in computer science
Apr 19 21:42:20 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Oh we're cold af.  It takes an excentric like me to convince internationals that the French can be anything other than stolid or fucking rude.
Apr 19 21:42:37 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 21:43:49 <zaeph>	Although, to be honest, most of that is due to my ability to convey my thoughts in English in a more elaborate prose than my compadres.
Apr 19 21:44:01 <zaeph>	We've got my English major to thank for that, eyooo.
Apr 19 21:44:25 <zaeph>	And I even got a job out of it, so suck on that Reddit!
Apr 19 21:44:40 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 21:44:58 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Any plans for after the Msc?  Academia?  Business?
Apr 19 21:45:05 <GermainZ>	zaeph: business
Apr 19 21:45:13 <GermainZ>	not academia if I can help it
Apr 19 21:45:13 <zaeph>	You sellout.
Apr 19 21:45:28 <zaeph>	You were supposed to destroy the Siths, not join them.
Apr 19 21:45:37 <GermainZ>	but you never know especially with the upcoming recession that will likely make finding jobs harder
Apr 19 21:45:55 <zaeph>	Financed PhD would be golden in that period.
Apr 19 21:46:04 <zaeph>	Msc are 1- or 2-year in Lebanon?
Apr 19 21:47:04 <GermainZ>	I'm in Switzerland to be clear
Apr 19 21:47:16 <GermainZ>	But usually 2 years part time in Lebanon, IIRC
Apr 19 21:47:16 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, I knew that.
Apr 19 21:47:40 <GermainZ>	At least for American system universities 
Apr 19 21:48:00 <zaeph>	And in Switzerland?  They follow LMD, right?
Apr 19 21:48:00 <GermainZ>	LMD?
Apr 19 21:48:04 <zaeph>	Licence, Master, Doctorat.
Apr 19 21:48:06 <GermainZ>	2 years minimum
Apr 19 21:48:06 <zaeph>	3, 5, 8.
Apr 19 21:48:09 <GermainZ>	120 ECTS credits + internship 
Apr 19 21:48:19 <zaeph>	Right.
Apr 19 21:48:26 <zaeph>	And in which year are you?
Apr 19 21:49:03 <GermainZ>	I'm doing mine in 3 years (long internship + slightly less load / semester)
Apr 19 21:49:03 <GermainZ>	I still have a year
Apr 19 21:49:05 <zaeph>	Not counting this one, right?
Apr 19 21:49:12 <zaeph>	I mean, counting this one.
Apr 19 21:49:16 <zaeph>	…You got me.
Apr 19 21:49:37 <GermainZ>	I still have a year (more or less) starting now
Apr 19 21:50:10 <zaeph>	Right.  Thanks for the details, and best of luck with everything. :)
Apr 19 21:50:20 <GermainZ>	Sure thing :)
Apr 19 21:50:20 <GermainZ>	And ty
Apr 19 21:50:20 <GermainZ>	To you as well
Apr 19 21:50:31 <zaeph>	Thanks!
Apr 19 21:50:31 <zaeph>	Hopefully I'll be able to crawl my way back to academia.
Apr 19 21:50:43 <zaeph>	By that time, they'll be *begging* for me to come back and grace them with my presence.
Apr 19 21:50:46 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what happened?
Apr 19 21:50:46 <zaeph>	…Hopefully.
Apr 19 21:50:54 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Couldn't write my thesis.  Too much pressure, too little work.
Apr 19 21:51:16 <zaeph>	Literally had every opportunity in the world to do it.
Apr 19 21:51:24 <GermainZ>	zaeph: PhD?
Apr 19 21:51:30 <zaeph>	Not even that, MA.
Apr 19 21:51:48 <GermainZ>	zaeph: how does that work in France?
Apr 19 21:51:48 <zaeph>	Right now, I'm wrapping up a 2nd backup MA for education with a shorter thesis.
Apr 19 21:52:13 <zaeph>	Thesis is required for validating the cursus.  Could have handed something shit and got 15/20, but I refused to settle for anything less than perfect.
Apr 19 21:53:20 <GermainZ>	Thesis = 6 months?
Apr 19 21:53:20 <zaeph>	All my professors have been grooming to join their ranks, and not one of them stopped to think whether it'd be good to ascertain whether I actually had the ability to do it.
Apr 19 21:53:45 <zaeph>	It's more about the output: we have to work on it for 2 years, but the final output should be ~100-150 pages.
Apr 19 21:54:03 <zaeph>	I've got so much material on Monty Python to write a PhD thesis.
Apr 19 21:54:21 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 21:54:30 <zaeph>	But the act of writing is daunting, and organising my thoughts on anything other than a verbal discussion is hell to me.
Apr 19 21:54:44 <zaeph>	That's also the chief reason why I'm trying to invest energy in a knowledge management system.
Apr 19 21:55:47 <zaeph>	Mind you, all the doors are still opened to me.  My supervisors are on stand-by waiting for me to get my shit together.
Apr 19 21:56:53 <zaeph>	My alma mater told me that they'd be willing to put me forward as a candidate for a financed PhD, which is a pretty rare thing in France.  Also have another opening at a university which is closer from where I work now.
Apr 19 21:59:03 <__monty__>	GermainZ: What uni?
Apr 19 21:59:20 <zaeph>	inb4 stalking.
Apr 19 21:59:20 <GermainZ>	zaeph: EPFL
Apr 19 21:59:20 <GermainZ>	__monty__: ^
Apr 19 21:59:44 <zaeph>	How's your zerotab.py working for you? :p
Apr 19 21:59:44 <GermainZ>	zaeph: :D
Apr 19 21:59:49 <zaeph>	(pretty sure there should be an 'out*' as well.)
Apr 19 22:00:52 <zaeph>	Oh wow, they have a GNU society? https://gnugeneration.epfl.ch/
Apr 19 22:02:02 <GermainZ>	They even have an IRC channel
Apr 19 22:02:24 <zaeph>	#hightech
Apr 19 22:04:41 <__monty__>	zaeph: It's one of two big tech unis in la Suisse.
Apr 19 22:05:09 <zaeph>	I had a Swiss friend who got to the other one I think.
Apr 19 22:06:39 <__monty__>	ETH?
Apr 19 22:07:00 <zaeph>	I think so, I don't quite remember.
Apr 19 22:07:22 <__monty__>	I think I'd like living in Zürich. Attend some classes at ETH.
Apr 19 22:07:48 <zaeph>	What are you actually doing for a living on your end, __monty__?
Apr 19 22:07:51 <zaeph>	Aside from being an insufferable git here.
Apr 19 22:08:13 <__monty__>	Living the neet life.
Apr 19 22:08:27 <GermainZ>	Yeah ETH-Zurich
Apr 19 22:08:27 <zaeph>	Neet life best life.
Apr 19 22:08:27 <GermainZ>	EPF is literally the French translation of ETH
Apr 19 22:08:45 <__monty__>	They're not seperate unis?
Apr 19 22:09:04 <__monty__>	I always thought it was like the UCL/ULB in Brussels.
Apr 19 22:10:06 <GermainZ>	Separate unis, same master board I think (but different individual direction)
Apr 19 22:10:33 <zaeph>	We do that kind of stuff for soft/hard sciences in France.
Apr 19 22:10:33 <zaeph>	My alma mater is split in two.
Apr 19 22:10:44 <__monty__>	Ah, so it *is* similar to the UCL/ULB situation.
Apr 19 22:10:45 <GermainZ>	Yeah I'd say so
Apr 19 22:10:48 <GermainZ>	French and Flamand right?
Apr 19 22:11:21 <__monty__>	Yeah. I'm not sure about the board though.
Apr 19 22:11:50 <zaeph>	Did you get a MSc, __monty__?
Apr 19 22:18:49 <zaeph>	I shall never know.
Apr 19 22:19:18 <zaeph>	No pressure, though.  Just mildly interested.
Apr 19 22:20:16 <__monty__>	Yep.
Apr 19 22:20:40 <zaeph>	And was too hip for the business life?
Apr 19 22:20:49 <__monty__>	MSc in CS. Which means I get to use "ir." as a title ツ
Apr 19 22:21:10 <zaeph>	Well, people get to call me `professor` even though I'm not. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apr 19 22:28:04 <rnmhdn>	can I create hardlinks with ranger?
Apr 19 22:28:31 <zaeph>	rnmhdn: `pl` or `pL` after `yy`.
Apr 19 22:28:41 <zaeph>	L is relative.
Apr 19 22:28:45 <zaeph>	`yy` is for copying.
Apr 19 22:29:24 <__monty__>	Those are symlinks I think?
Apr 19 22:29:29 <rnmhdn>	I found it
Apr 19 22:29:33 <rnmhdn>	phl
Apr 19 22:29:45 <zaeph>	Oh, sorry, misread that.
Apr 19 22:30:23 <rnmhdn>	god
Apr 19 22:30:29 <rnmhdn>	I'm in love with hardlinks
Apr 19 22:30:29 <zaeph>	Yes?
Apr 19 22:30:31 <rnmhdn>	:))
Apr 19 22:30:38 <rnmhdn>	it's super cool and useful
Apr 19 22:32:26 <GermainZ>	I prefer symlinks because if they break at least I know what they were pointing to
Apr 19 22:32:47 <GermainZ>	also they're more explicit
Apr 19 22:33:01 <zaeph>	Like your mum!
Apr 19 22:33:13 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 22:33:24 <__monty__>	Well, hardlinks can't break.
Apr 19 22:33:30 <__monty__>	They're more limited though.
Apr 19 22:33:39 <__monty__>	No dirs, no device boundary crossing.
Apr 19 22:33:43 <GermainZ>	__monty__: they can "break" if you use some weird tool which deletes and rewrites or similar for in-place modifications 
Apr 19 22:33:43 <zaeph>	Like my--
Apr 19 22:33:46 <zaeph>	God dang it.
Apr 19 22:34:06 <__monty__>	I don't consider that breaking.
Apr 19 22:34:11 <GermainZ>	I do
Apr 19 22:34:16 <GermainZ>	It's broken and I have to fix it
Apr 19 22:34:27 <GermainZ>	It's not really the fault of hardlinks
Apr 19 22:34:30 <GermainZ>	But it is broken for me
Apr 19 22:34:31 <__monty__>	That's a very common pattern in unix tools though.
Apr 19 22:34:45 <GermainZ>	So I just don't use hardlinks
Apr 19 22:37:12 <__monty__>	I don't tend to use them much either.
Apr 19 22:37:32 <__monty__>	Many tools break the link when copying them too.
Apr 19 22:39:20 <zaeph>	I used to rely on them a lot for a workflow with my music.
Apr 19 22:39:23 <zaeph>	Now I just don't bother.
Apr 19 22:40:50 <GermainZ>	What's the advantage over symlinks tho? Except for some poorly coded tools that may refuse to work with symlinks
Apr 19 22:41:11 <__monty__>	No indirections.
Apr 19 22:41:19 <zaeph>	I need that for my life.
Apr 19 22:41:21 <__monty__>	And ever so slightly less data.
Apr 19 22:41:46 <GermainZ>	I don't see no indirection as a benefit tho
Apr 19 22:42:22 <__monty__>	Not everyone cares about performance.
Apr 19 22:42:36 <__monty__>	Another thing is how it interacts with nfs for example.
Apr 19 22:42:53 <GermainZ>	But does it actually affect performance? Or is it a nanosecond difference?
Apr 19 22:43:03 <GermainZ>	How does it interact with nfs?
Apr 19 22:44:03 <__monty__>	Hardlink, look up inode, look up linked inode, done. Symlink, look up inode, read link, look up other inode by path, read contents.
Apr 19 22:44:19 <__monty__>	That's definitely gonna be more than a nanosecond.
Apr 19 22:44:58 <__monty__>	Symlinks are evaluated relative to the mount. So a symlink to a file outside the NFS share will point to that file on the user's system.
Apr 19 22:45:02 <zaeph>	Definitely a half-dozen nanoseconds, then.
Apr 19 22:45:11 <GermainZ>	Yeah, a couple nanoseconds depending on the CPU :D
Apr 19 22:45:24 <zaeph>	(Sorry for not contributing much to the conversation.  Filesystems aren't my cup of tea.
Apr 19 22:46:01 <__monty__>	That *can* be used usefully, having a program on a share use a user's config for example. But that's rarely useful and the other way around, sharing files without having them in the shared directory is really common.
Apr 19 22:46:04 <GermainZ>	__monty__: oh I see about nfs
Apr 19 22:46:34 <__monty__>	You guys don't realize this is about disk IO. It's orders of magnitude slower.
Apr 19 22:46:59 <zaeph>	Well I'll have you know I have an SSD!
Apr 19 22:47:00 <GermainZ>	It's still nanoseconds
Apr 19 22:47:03 <zaeph>	/s, btw.
Apr 19 22:47:55 <__monty__>	A single lookup on an SSD is on the order of 0.5 ms.
Apr 19 22:50:15 <GermainZ>	You're right, it's not nanoseconds
Apr 19 22:50:59 <GermainZ>	But 0.5 ms is probably the worst case with modern SSDs being a fraction of that
Apr 19 22:51:04 <__monty__>	It's literally millions of nanoseconds.
Apr 19 22:51:10 <GermainZ>	Still in the order of a few dozen/hundred microseconds
Apr 19 22:52:17 <rnmhdn>	but softlinks don't work with git do they?
Apr 19 22:53:03 <GermainZ>	depends on the config
Apr 19 22:53:14 <GermainZ>	but not really no
Apr 19 22:53:20 <__monty__>	Why wouldn't they? I'd expect something similar to the NFS behavior.
Apr 19 22:53:53 <GermainZ>	yes that's the default IIRC
Apr 19 22:54:05 <zaeph>	(Neat mode for Emacs for helping you track your cursor across jumps: https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon )
Apr 19 22:54:09 <GermainZ>	but that's not working depending on why you're symlinking
Apr 19 22:57:30 <__monty__>	I don't tend to have many identical files across repos tbh.
Apr 19 22:57:33 <__monty__>	Maybe the LICENSE?
Apr 19 22:58:23 <GermainZ>	Yeah it's usually the other way around for me anyway (a symlink to a file in a git repo)
Apr 19 22:58:47 <__monty__>	That's common for dotfiles yeah.
Apr 19 23:00:05 <GermainZ>	zaeph: that's pretty neat
Apr 19 23:00:28 <zaeph>	I like it a lot.
Apr 19 23:00:41 <zaeph>	I'd have shown you a demo, but my gif-screencast doesn't pick it up.
Apr 19 23:00:55 <GermainZ>	zaeph: there is one in the github repo
Apr 19 23:01:04 <zaeph>	Yeah, that's why I've linked this one instead.
Apr 19 23:01:23 <zaeph>	Would have been better to make you my own demo, since their gif is pretty low-quality.
Apr 19 23:01:27 <__monty__>	I've had something similar in vim. Doesn't need a plugin, just a simple config.
Apr 19 23:01:43 <zaeph>	__monty__: Yeah, I've also seen someone mention that on Reddit.
Apr 19 23:01:58 <zaeph>	I already highlight the current line, so I wasn't in dire need of it, but it's a nice boon.
Apr 19 23:02:14 <zaeph>	https://paste.xinu.at/5Th/
Apr 19 23:02:16 <__monty__>	It's the emacs is a great OS lacking a nice editor thing all over again.
Apr 19 23:02:28 <zaeph>	I'm fine with it.
Apr 19 23:02:41 <GermainZ>	in vim I just have cursorline always on
Apr 19 23:03:06 <GermainZ>	which I like better
Apr 19 23:03:16 <GermainZ>	but that plugin is creative and I like it very much
Apr 19 23:03:28 <zaeph>	Another package that I love in Emacs is the one that highlights texts that was added by undo/redo.
Apr 19 23:03:51 <zaeph>	It doesn't have any impact on performance, too.
Apr 19 23:03:59 <zaeph>	If you start moving before the animation is over, it just cancels the rest of it.
Apr 19 23:04:02 <GermainZ>	it's in the order of nanoseconds
Apr 19 23:04:05 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 19 23:04:12 <zaeph>	Not even close.
Apr 19 23:04:15 <zaeph>	More like 0.5s.
Apr 19 23:04:26 <GermainZ>	the performance impact? that's pretty bad eh?
Apr 19 23:04:26 <zaeph>	ms*, dang it.
Apr 19 23:04:40 <zaeph>	I was just quoting __monty__ senpai.

Apr 20 09:14:04 <rnmhdn>	I'm obsessed with hardlinks!
Apr 20 09:14:07 <rnmhdn>	linux is the beeeest
Apr 20 09:14:28 <zaeph>	+1
Apr 20 09:14:55 <rnmhdn>	hardlinks are super useful for hiding your shit in your filesystem
Apr 20 09:15:01 <rnmhdn>	lol
Apr 20 09:15:54 <zaeph>	I just encrypt without a header and call it a day.
Apr 20 09:16:08 <zaeph>	Sure, it might give off a pattern on a SSD, but I haven't pushed the neurosis to that point yet.
Apr 20 09:17:14 <rnmhdn>	can you elaborate
Apr 20 09:17:42 <zaeph>	rnmhdn: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system
Apr 20 09:18:09 <zaeph>	I use LUKS on LVM with a remote header that is itself in a passphrase-protected LUKS container.
Apr 20 09:19:07 <zaeph>	Which means than when the 2nd LUKS container is not here, you cannot decrypt the main LUKS container, and it will appear as noise to your system.  Forensics might be able to tell that a filesystem is in place because of the `trim` option needed to have SSDs last longer.

Apr 20 09:45:40 <RoboBobob>	09:18 <zaeph> __monty__: Found yet another blog-post on incorporating the slip-box in Emacs, this time not using org-roam: https://dpitt.me/blog/2020/03/zettelkasten/
Apr 20 09:45:42 <RoboBobob>	09:19 <zaeph> __monty__: Haven't read it, though.
Apr 20 09:49:49 <__monty__>	I don't know why but org-mode's property syntax really offends me.
Apr 20 09:50:01 <__monty__>	Maybe it's the all caps.
Apr 20 09:50:04 <zaeph>	It's all right, really.  I did something pretty neat with them at 4am yesterday.
Apr 20 09:51:15 <zaeph>	It doesn't look too bad, and you can fold it: https://paste.xinu.at/MbCd/
Apr 20 09:52:05 <__monty__>	It does look *too* bad.
Apr 20 09:52:25 <zaeph>	Well, there are some codes online to remove them entirely.
Apr 20 09:52:41 <zaeph>	But it's good when you need to act programmatically on entries.
Apr 20 09:52:53 <zaeph>	My org-agenda custom-views make a lot of use of them.
Apr 20 09:55:13 <__monty__>	Yeah, that's why it's such a shame they're *so* ugly.
Apr 20 09:55:33 <zaeph>	Frankly, I don't mind them.  I hardly see them anymore, they're folded by default.
Apr 20 09:56:54 <GermainZ>	kinda like your face eh?
Apr 20 09:57:13 <zaeph>	…Oh. :(
Apr 20 09:57:26 *	GermainZ hugs zaeph
Apr 20 09:57:29 <GermainZ>	I'm kidding it's ok ❤
Apr 20 09:57:31 <zaeph>	Not the right moment to get on my nerves: linting my init file in Emacs.
Apr 20 09:57:37 <zaeph>	And it's *nightmarish*.
Apr 20 09:58:15 <GermainZ>	yup sounds like Emacs
Apr 20 09:58:43 <zaeph>	You're supposed to lint your files regularly.  Couldn't do it because my file was too large, and there is something that makes the linter ragequit.
Apr 20 09:58:57 <GermainZ>	What does linting do in Emacs?
Apr 20 09:58:58 <zaeph>	So, slowly bisecting.  Because fuck work, amirightornah?
Apr 20 09:59:11 <zaeph>	GermainZ: https://paste.xinu.at/YFIytp/
Apr 20 09:59:24 <GermainZ>	Yeah so normal linting
Apr 20 09:59:31 <zaeph>	Pretty much.
Apr 20 09:59:47 <GermainZ>	So many warnings
Apr 20 10:00:02 <zaeph>	Most of them are fakes.
Apr 20 10:00:17 <__monty__>	Split up your config into modules if it's that big, sheesh. What a scrub.
Apr 20 10:00:19 <zaeph>	The linter doesn't play nicely with use-package macros.
Apr 20 10:00:30 <zaeph>	__monty__: Yo, I've been doing that for over a year, slowly modularising.
Apr 20 10:00:42 <__monty__>	Too slowly I guess : p
Apr 20 10:01:03 <zaeph>	https://paste.xinu.at/SNy/
Apr 20 10:01:06 <zaeph>	It's coming around slowly.
Apr 20 10:01:18 <GermainZ>	modularization rate: 1.1
Apr 20 10:01:21 <zaeph>	I mean, my init.el is *only* 5503 lines after all.
Apr 20 10:01:24 <GermainZ>	adding new stuff rate: 9.73
Apr 20 10:03:06 <__monty__>	Lol, "emacs is so great," need so much config  you could've just implemented vim...
Apr 20 10:03:42 <GermainZ>	lmao
Apr 20 10:03:51 <zaeph>	Not cool, man.
Apr 20 10:29:19 <__monty__>	Sorry, zaeph, I apologize if the truth hurts.
Apr 20 10:29:44 <zaeph>	I'm as concise with my prose as I am with my code.
Apr 20 10:29:50 <zaeph>	…I'm getting better, though.
Apr 20 10:30:16 <zaeph>	But it's also because a lot of people on Emacs end up wiping their configs regularly.  I don't think I've ever done that.  I've just kept refining it from the beginning.
Apr 20 10:30:20 <zaeph>	Never started tabula rasa.
Apr 20 11:02:38 <__monty__>	Then it still being performant and hackable's impressive.
Apr 20 11:03:06 <zaeph>	__monty__: I did optimise it.  I just made a point of only pruning, never starting from scratch.
Apr 20 11:03:26 <zaeph>	Even when I transitioned to another way to set up one's init file (by jwiegley), I still kept to that word.
Apr 20 12:07:50 <vifon>	Free ebooks, fellas.  https://ebookclub.tor.com/
Apr 20 12:08:15 <zaeph>	vifon: Thanks!
Apr 20 12:10:47 <__monty__>	Restricted to US/Canada.
Apr 20 12:15:23 <GermainZ>	__monty__: VPN?
Apr 20 12:16:13 <__monty__>	GermainZ: I'm not even sure they check. But I don't use VPNs
Apr 20 13:10:00 <zaeph>	Ah, Emacs.  Gotta love not being able to open a file because I've got a 5000-char line in the middle of it.
Apr 20 13:10:16 <zaeph>	(Regexp went rogue.)
Apr 20 13:10:26 <zaeph>	(…It's been fully dispatched, now.)
Apr 20 13:11:15 <__monty__>	>.<
Apr 20 13:13:16 <zaeph>	Actually looks quite aesthetically pleasing: https://paste.xinu.at/zqhKSa/
Apr 20 13:13:58 <zaeph>	Time to open vim and fuck things up!
Apr 20 13:14:13 <zaeph>	Nevermind, only got vi installed.
Apr 20 13:14:49 <zaeph>	Beautiful. https://paste.xinu.at/Jh35/
Apr 20 13:15:29 <zaeph>	Even vi crashed. :D
Apr 20 13:16:21 <zaeph>	Thank god for so-long-mode.

Apr 20 13:58:15 <__monty__>	>.<
Apr 20 14:57:14 <zaeph>	All right, I give up.
Apr 20 14:57:32 <zaeph>	Been trying to fight redo corruption for a function I've written in Emacs.
Apr 20 14:57:38 <zaeph>	Done, enver wanna hear about undo again.
Apr 20 14:57:43 <zaeph>	redo*
Apr 20 15:00:49 <zaeph>	At least I got a nice working function out of it.  Who needs redoing anyway.
Apr 20 15:06:47 <GermainZ>	zaeph: vim won't have an issue with a sensible synmaxcol
Apr 20 15:06:53 <GermainZ>	I'm sure Emacs has something similar
Apr 20 15:09:52 <zaeph>	It does, so-long-mode.
Apr 20 15:10:16 <zaeph>	I ended up fixing it.  But I got stuck on an edge case for the longest time.  History corruption on redo.
Apr 20 15:10:40 <zaeph>	I could mitigate it by slowing down the execution of the function, but I didn't think it was worth it.  Bah, we'll see.
Apr 20 15:11:12 <GermainZ>	why not just remove all the sleeps in your code?
Apr 20 15:11:33 <GermainZ>	it's how hut improved ranger's performance by 390% in version 1.2.1.9
Apr 20 15:11:57 <zaeph>	…I'll think about it.
Apr 20 15:12:07 <zaeph>	I'm pretty sure that `sleep 5s` is essential, though.
Apr 20 15:13:30 <zaeph>	I mean, worst case scenario, if the command fuck ups, I'll just have a not-replaced newline.  Not the end of the world.
Apr 20 15:13:51 <zaeph>	And it's commented stuff too.  Anyway, this isn't making any sense to non org-moders, so I'll shut up now.
Apr 20 15:21:38 <GermainZ>	Finally, sweet silence.
Apr 20 15:22:01 <zaeph>	I can pick up right where I left off, so don't get cocky.
Apr 20 15:22:09 <zaeph>	Sorry, I've kind of been obsessing about this today.
Apr 20 15:22:16 <GermainZ>	:D
Apr 20 15:24:01 <__monty__>	zaeph: Usually sleep is a wart. If something needs to be synchronised you should synchronise it.
Apr 20 15:26:16 <zaeph>	Okay, now I'm confused.
Apr 20 15:26:27 <zaeph>	Was the sleep thing a joke, or does it mean something that I don't know?
Apr 20 15:27:14 <zaeph>	Oh, I think I've got it.  The problem with the redo wasn't due to sleep, but to a corruption that occurred in the org-agenda history.  There's nothing I can do about it, and the info online is sparse.
Apr 20 15:29:21 <__monty__>	zaeph: I assumed GermainZ was referring to actual sleep commands in your code.
Apr 20 15:30:09 <GermainZ>	I was joking
Apr 20 15:30:14 <zaeph>	I'm pretty sure it was a joke, but GermainZ--

Apr 20 21:11:03 <__monty__>	I will, when I get back to french.
Apr 20 21:11:08 <__monty__>	Why so sad?
Apr 20 21:11:59 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)
Apr 20 21:12:22 <zaeph>	Hi grobi!
Apr 20 21:12:27 <zaeph>	How's the computer?
Apr 20 21:12:57 <grobi>	ha you mean my usb filesystem? lost so far ..
Apr 20 21:13:12 <zaeph>	Oh well.  RIP.
Apr 20 21:14:11 <grobi>	nah i would give windows formatter give a try when i will be back at school again
Apr 20 21:14:44 <grobi>	so this will be probably be in 5 weeks ...
Apr 20 21:52:30 <zaeph>	So Slack is only allowing you to see the last 10k messages on the free plan? -.-
Apr 20 21:53:17 <GermainZ>	Yes
Apr 20 21:53:24 <zaeph>	That's super dreadful for support.  I thought the help I was offering there would last a little longer.
Apr 20 21:53:33 <zaeph>	We'd be better off moving to Reddit, really.
Apr 20 21:53:38 <GermainZ>	Treat it like IRC
Apr 20 21:53:52 <GermainZ>	(yes IRC can be logged but let's face it it's not really useful for support)
Apr 20 21:53:55 <zaeph>	Right.  I guess I'll stop writing long stuff, then.
Apr 20 21:54:21 <zaeph>	Still pretty damn happy about wee-slack btw, thanks again!
Apr 20 21:54:28 <zaeph>	And the same goes for dark-reader.
Apr 20 21:54:34 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I don't think any messaging platform is well suited towards long-term storage and searchability TBH
Apr 20 21:54:44 <GermainZ>	different goals
Apr 20 21:54:50 <zaeph>	Yeah, I agree.
Apr 20 21:55:23 <zaeph>	I think I just went at it with more of a 'Reddit' approach, structuring what I was writing.
Apr 20 22:06:52 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Apr 20 22:07:13 <zaeph>	__monty__: You tit.
Apr 20 22:07:41 <zaeph>	__monty__: I hope you're ashamed of yourself.  Don't you dare show your face in here again.

Apr 21 11:58:03 <__monty__>	o.O I've never had an rm take this long : /
Apr 21 12:00:41 <zaeph>	Make sure nobody's aliases it to rm your /.
Apr 21 12:00:50 <zaeph>	aliased*
Apr 21 12:01:15 <__monty__>	It's a partial backup of a nix store on an external disk.
Apr 21 12:01:40 <__monty__>	Have I mentioned I'm *still* running that backup?
Apr 21 12:03:32 <zaeph>	Hasn't it been like a week?
Apr 21 12:04:05 <__monty__>	About, yeah.
Apr 21 12:05:09 <zaeph>	Phew.  Good luck to your little computer, then.
Apr 21 12:41:31 <GermainZ>	So mentioning someone by name after they've logged off automatically makes RoboBobob tell them?
Apr 21 12:41:33 <GermainZ>	That's neat
Apr 21 12:41:40 <GermainZ>	I thought you had to use .tell
Apr 21 12:41:56 <zaeph>	.tell GermainZ No.
Apr 21 12:43:08 <GermainZ>	:(
Apr 21 12:43:17 <GermainZ>	zaeph: so you manually used .tell in a query?
Apr 21 12:43:24 <zaeph>	.tell GermainZ No.
Apr 21 12:43:28 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what did you do
Apr 21 12:43:35 <zaeph>	More seriously, yeah, you just need to mention their nick.
Apr 21 12:43:49 <zaeph>	I'm not sure if it's just mentions, or if it has to be at ^ with the colon afterwards.
Apr 21 12:44:06 <GermainZ>	Cool
Apr 21 13:20:19 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Bob does .tell, Bobob does the offline mention thing but I think vifon manually curates whom it keeps track of.
Apr 21 13:21:19 <vifon>	Correct.
Apr 21 13:22:37 <__monty__>	: O A wild vifon appears!
Apr 21 13:22:59 *	__monty__ fumbles around in his pockets for PRs to request reviews on.
Apr 21 13:24:08 <vifon>	My overtime has its own overtime these days. :(
Apr 21 13:28:38 <__monty__>	Just log ranger work as "exploratory work resulting in a dead-end."
Apr 21 13:28:40 <__monty__>	: )
Apr 21 13:29:22 <zaeph>	__monty__: That could probably be valid for the entirety of my life endeavours.
Apr 21 13:33:22 <rnmhdn>	GermainZ: Telegram is pretty good with long-term storage and searchability in my experience
Apr 21 13:34:45 <__monty__>	It's a weird forum-y platform.
Apr 21 13:35:03 <rnmhdn>	I totally hate slack
Apr 21 13:35:29 <rnmhdn>	same for pinterest and linked-in
Apr 21 13:36:58 <__monty__>	Anyone looking for a good CS paper to read?

Apr 21 17:35:08 <zaeph>	__monty__: I was on the fence about it, but I think that for dev work, it looks better.
Apr 21 17:35:15 <zaeph>	I'll keep the capital for long-form!
Apr 21 17:35:43 <zaeph>	Also: you can't distract me from revisions if I'm not revising in the first place! Sike!
Apr 21 17:37:41 <zaeph>	Should probably get started on it, but I have no desire to do so.  Looks like it's going to be yet another wild bullshitting session, no wonder I got away from uni with an imposteur syndrome. 
Apr 21 17:37:52 <__monty__>	Wow, just wow. Maybe I *can* distract you by teaching you some english, scrub? *Psych*
Apr 21 17:38:40 <zaeph>	I interject however I want!  I didn't remember the spelling, and when I wrote 'Syke', it makes me think of Israel, so…
Apr 21 17:38:40 <__monty__>	Heh, impostor syndrome but with lots of "Hon Hon" and mustache twiddling mixed in.
Apr 21 17:38:57 <zaeph>	That's what I'm referencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement
Apr 21 17:39:18 <zaeph>	Man, I got everything wrong in that one line.
Apr 21 17:39:41 <zaeph>	Don't get my teaching licence revoked pls.
Apr 21 17:40:17 <__monty__>	Wow, Sykes looks a lot like Stephen Fry in Blackadder.

Apr 21 22:46:38 <__monty__>	nn, zaeph 
Apr 21 22:47:34 <grobi>	sleeep tight zaeph 
Apr 21 22:51:01 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Apr 21 22:51:11 <__monty__>	Did you get your problem fixed, grobi?
Apr 21 22:51:22 <grobi>	good night __monty__ 
Apr 21 22:51:45 <grobi>	ah not yet
Apr 21 22:52:15 <grobi>	but .profile seems not to be the solution..
Apr 21 22:52:35 <grobi>	and then i got distracted
Apr 21 22:52:47 <__monty__>	grobi: Did you put `-c` in the .profile?
Apr 21 22:53:17 <grobi>	yes, i saw your note about that
Apr 21 22:53:27 <__monty__>	Then you didn't even read the man page?
Apr 21 22:53:49 <__monty__>	Terminator uses either -e or -x, I'd prefer the latter in this case.
Apr 21 22:54:01 <__monty__>	So .profile should contain exactly the next line:
Apr 21 22:54:12 <__monty__>	export TERMCMD='terminator -x'
Apr 21 22:54:26 <grobi>	well terminater was not the only terminal i tried
Apr 21 22:54:37 <__monty__>	Then you need to make sure your shell loads that file, easiest way is to open a new terminal.
Apr 21 22:55:00 <__monty__>	Then check the variable is set with `echo $TERMCMD`.
Apr 21 22:55:48 <grobi>	ok 
Apr 21 22:57:19 <grobi>	i'll try tomorrow.. now it would lead nowhere except to more confusion.. too tired :)
Apr 21 22:58:53 <__monty__>	Fine, nn

Apr 22 14:21:19 <zaeph>	One more exam to go for today.  Shamelessly cheating.  💪
Apr 22 14:22:21 <zaeph>	Last exam of the day is… oral comprehension.  You wouldn't believe how low the bar is.
Apr 22 14:26:37 <zaeph>	Back to it!
Apr 22 14:57:19 <Luyin>	hihi. oral and "low bars".
Apr 22 14:57:21 *	Luyin snickers
Apr 22 15:02:59 <__monty__>	Hmm, I could go for a snickers bar right about now.
Apr 22 16:19:12 <zaeph>	All right, I'm back.
Apr 22 16:19:30 <zaeph>	Luyin: Was a pretty good oral.  I'd come back for me if I wasn't so spent right now.
Apr 22 16:20:16 <Luyin>	lol
Apr 22 16:20:18 <Luyin>	nice!
Apr 22 16:21:02 <zaeph>	Survived Day 1, 5h of exams.  Same thing tomorrow. -.-
Apr 22 16:21:21 <zaeph>	That's definitely *not* going to be something I miss from uni.
Apr 22 16:59:28 <__monty__>	That sounds terrible.
Apr 22 17:00:40 <zaeph>	It is, and it's part of the reasons why the first year of teaching in France is going to be different.  We're overladen with work from Sep 01 to the 1st week of May.
Apr 22 17:00:58 <zaeph>	Having to juggle both half-time teaching and half-time studies.
Apr 22 18:40:18 <__monty__>	zaeph: Hmm, not convinced by neuron : /
Apr 22 18:40:28 <zaeph>	__monty__: What don't you like about it?
Apr 22 18:42:23 <__monty__>	The URI scheme. The UI isn't that great imo. Searching's kinda clunky.
Apr 22 18:42:48 <zaeph>	So what are your options, now?
Apr 22 18:42:53 <__monty__>	I think I'd rather have a SQLite DB without any specific Zettelkasten support.
Apr 22 18:43:15 <zaeph>	Do you think you could write it?  You could probably reuse org-roam's code for that.
Apr 22 18:43:41 <zaeph>	It'd be refactoring the wheel, but I understand that Emacs can be a big barrier to entry.
Apr 22 18:49:25 <__monty__>	I'd probably start from scratch tbh.
Apr 22 18:49:41 <__monty__>	Just to figure out what I want and need.
Apr 22 18:49:45 <zaeph>	Don't you think you could contribute to neuron to improve the UI?
Apr 22 18:49:59 <zaeph>	At least you'd have a community against which to bounce ideas.
Apr 22 18:50:08 <__monty__>	It looks like an opinionated personal tool tbh.
Apr 22 18:50:27 <__monty__>	I'd look at using scribble.
Apr 22 18:50:43 <__monty__>	And PML if that doesn't work out.
Apr 22 18:50:53 <zaeph>	I think that we're addressing the 'opinionated personal' stuff pretty nicely with org-roam thanks to switches.  WE
Apr 22 18:51:04 <zaeph>	We've added quite a bit of them to have the user tailor their experience.
Apr 22 18:56:58 <__monty__>	RIP github notification UI you'll be dearly missed :'(
Apr 22 18:57:26 <zaeph>	In other news, the keyboard purchase has led me to finally consider moving to an ergonomic layout.
Apr 22 18:57:40 <zaeph>	I'm thinking either Bépo or Dvorak.
Apr 22 19:02:43 <__monty__>	You mean you've chosen Dvorak but you want a dalliance with a french floozy first?
Apr 22 19:02:47 <__monty__>	: >
Apr 22 19:03:06 <zaeph>	Floozy, wow, I hadn't read that word in ages, thanks.
Apr 22 19:03:26 <__monty__>	But you read about dalliances on a regular basis?
Apr 22 19:03:29 <zaeph>	And no, I don't know.  The studies I've read seem to indicate that Dvorak is a little bad for French.
Apr 22 19:03:39 <__monty__>	No accents.
Apr 22 19:03:39 <zaeph>	__monty__: Regular, no, but more often, yes.
Apr 22 19:03:45 <__monty__>	So they'd all be compose.
Apr 22 19:04:06 <zaeph>	I'd be tweaking it with the Planck, though, so they wouldn't be harder than what I'm doing now.
Apr 22 19:04:24 <zaeph>	But I'm doing like 90% English, 10% French.
Apr 22 19:04:25 <__monty__>	Yeah, and you could switch to a layout with easily accessible accents.
Apr 22 19:04:42 <zaeph>	I think I'd be better off going for Dvorak, then.
Apr 22 19:12:12 <__monty__>	Probably, but check it out to see if you like it. No harm.
Apr 22 19:12:25 <__monty__>	I'd also look at colemak probably.
Apr 22 19:14:36 <zaeph>	It's about finger-roll without alternation, right?
Apr 22 19:17:05 <__monty__>	It's "How do we improve the keyboard as much as possible while staying as close as possible to QWERTY."
Apr 22 19:17:21 <__monty__>	There's one other I'd look at but don't remember the name.
Apr 22 19:17:24 <zaeph>	Yeah, I do remember, but I remember it also being about finger-rolling.
Apr 22 19:17:28 <zaeph>	Workman?
Apr 22 19:17:35 <__monty__>	Ah, sounds like it yeah.
Apr 22 19:17:57 <__monty__>	And maybe carpalX just because it's interesting.
Apr 22 19:18:57 <zaeph>	I've tried Dvorak and Colemak for one month each, and I remember prefering Dvorak.
Apr 22 19:19:08 <zaeph>	I remember my name being a pain to write on the Dvorak, though.
Apr 22 19:19:29 <zaeph>	Mind you, it's just because I wasn't used to it.
Apr 22 19:19:41 <__monty__>	Not true, zaeph, QED>
Apr 22 19:19:53 <__monty__>	ツ
Apr 22 19:20:08 <zaeph>	Also, another bad point for the Bépo is the position of the W: right pinkie, 2 cases to the right. -.-
Apr 22 19:20:12 <zaeph>	And on the top-row.
Apr 22 19:20:13 <__monty__>	That's a typo you'll make often though > instead of . when typing CAPS.
Apr 22 19:20:27 <__monty__>	======
Apr 22 19:20:38 <__monty__>	Woops, was checking what key was there.
Apr 22 19:20:46 <zaeph>	Here's the Bépo, btw: https://download.tuxfamily.org/dvorak/wiki/images/Bepo-1.1-base.png .
Apr 22 19:21:11 <__monty__>	Bépo sounds like a french clown.
Apr 22 19:21:21 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, it does.
Apr 22 19:21:31 <__monty__>	The position of colon and semicolon and exclam is *so* weird though.
Apr 22 19:21:44 <__monty__>	Those are total power positions.
Apr 22 19:22:14 <zaeph>	We're pretty dramatic in France, y'know.
Apr 22 19:22:27 <zaeph>	We're way less chill than you are.
Apr 22 19:37:00 <zaeph>	In other news, org-roam-bibtex got accepted into MELPA. :D
Apr 22 19:37:22 <zaeph>	I'm officially among The Elected™, an official member of the Emacs community.
Apr 22 19:58:03 <__monty__>	Is any more rigorous standard applied than "this person submitted a package to MELPA?"
Apr 22 19:59:40 <zaeph>	Well, your package has to get vetted to get onto MELPA.
Apr 22 20:00:15 <zaeph>	But I was only joking.  It's a good step, but it doesn't mean anything.
Apr 22 20:02:06 <__monty__>	Just busting your chops ; )
Apr 22 20:02:26 <zaeph>	Oooh~, nice: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/
Apr 22 20:02:46 <zaeph>	inb4 it's not mono and Covid starts hitting me with a newspaper.
Apr 22 20:02:49 <zaeph>	Kovid* >.<
Apr 22 20:02:57 <zaeph>	I swear to god I thought about it and *still* got it wrong.
Apr 22 20:04:41 <__monty__>	Did I ever show you Monoid?
Apr 22 20:04:54 <zaeph>	I think you did, yes.
Apr 22 20:05:12 <zaeph>	Wait, no, I think I'm confusing it with something else.
Apr 22 20:05:14 <__monty__>	Ah yeah, and Fira. When we were working on the logo.
Apr 22 20:05:22 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, you're right!
Apr 22 20:06:35 <zaeph>	JetBrains is nice.  It's like a wider Iosevka.
Apr 22 20:06:50 <zaeph>	Still prefer Iosevka, though.
Apr 22 20:15:13 <__monty__>	You and your inferior font fetish -_-
Apr 22 20:15:19 <__monty__>	: )
Apr 22 20:16:22 <zaeph>	I like my fonts just like I like my women: tall, angular, and a little dense.
Apr 22 20:49:33 <zaeph>	Man, I've never taken the time to watch Computerphile videos, but they're quite interesting.
Apr 22 20:49:44 <zaeph>	It might help that I've got a little more programming experience under my belt now.

Apr 22 21:18:10 <__monty__>	They are interesting.
Apr 22 21:21:59 <zaeph>	In another timeline, I might have pursued my studies in linguistics, and connected the wagon to my CompSci interests.
Apr 22 21:59:54 <zaeph>	Welp, got mildly interested into `evil-mode` for Emacs again.  Might give it a shot this weekend.
Apr 22 22:00:16 <zaeph>	I don't mind the default keybindings, and I don't have any problems with my hand, but I'm just interested in trying out a different paradigm.

Apr 23 07:03:13 <Luyin>	good morning
Apr 23 07:03:19 <zaeph>	Hi!
Apr 23 07:05:54 <Luyin>	how's things zaeph?
Apr 23 07:06:24 <zaeph>	Luyin: Pretty good.  Getting ready for my 2nd and last day of exams with 5h of composition.
Apr 23 07:06:30 <Luyin>	oof
Apr 23 07:06:35 <zaeph>	…Yup.
Apr 23 07:06:35 <Luyin>	how much more do you have to do?
Apr 23 07:06:43 <zaeph>	It's the last one, fortunately.
Apr 23 07:06:46 <Luyin>	in terms of study/training
Apr 23 07:07:00 <zaeph>	Last year as well.  Officially my last day of exams *ever*.
Apr 23 07:07:34 <zaeph>	Well, unless I go for another run later down the line, but it'll be for shits'n'giggles by then.
Apr 23 07:08:10 <Luyin>	cool :) if it's okay to ask, what training/university subject/whatever do you do?
Apr 23 07:09:31 <zaeph>	I'm an English major in France, specialised in literature and aesthetics.  I took a side-step to become an English teacher for secondary school students because I needed to finance myself, but I intend to get back to university for a PhD.
Apr 23 07:09:49 <Luyin>	oh wow
Apr 23 07:10:14 <zaeph>	I'm quite the last sheep in #ranger, aren't I?
Apr 23 07:10:17 <zaeph>	lost*
Apr 23 07:10:39 <Luyin>	eend du yu spiiik good inGlish orh laik a frænch pursən? /s
Apr 23 07:10:43 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 23 07:10:53 <zaeph>	My accent is my forte, actually.
Apr 23 07:11:25 <Luyin>	nice :)
Apr 23 07:11:33 <zaeph>	Study/taught in the UK and the US, and whilst the UK couldn't place my accent, they were sure that I was a native.  In the US, they just couldn't be arsed with guessing and just said UK.
Apr 23 07:11:58 <Luyin>	I've started to learn a bit of French, actually, last year, because I went to Bordeaux for vacation, but I was really bad at it I think :D
Apr 23 07:12:00 <zaeph>	It's part of the benefits of studying phonology and phonetics.
Apr 23 07:12:21 <zaeph>	Bad, don't worry.  We're bad at every language anyway, especially English, so #nojudgement.
Apr 23 07:12:26 <Luyin>	:)
Apr 23 07:12:38 <zaeph>	(Bad → Bah*0
Apr 23 07:12:56 <zaeph>	I've got the sun hitting my monitor at exactly the right angle to make my writing experience absolutely fucked. 👍
Apr 23 07:13:21 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 23 07:13:32 <zaeph>	And you, what are you doing on your end?
Apr 23 07:14:10 <Luyin>	I'm lucky in regards to this. my desk stands so that no sun can ever fall onto my monitors, unless the sun falls onto the earth and melts my walls away, in which case I'd end up with a whole bunch of less problems all at once anyway.
Apr 23 07:14:32 *	Luyin is looking into some code for review for work
Apr 23 07:14:45 <Luyin>	not going to write any today, though
Apr 23 07:15:09 <zaeph>	Just say that you haven't pushed your work to remote, they'll believe you. :3
Apr 23 07:17:07 <Luyin>	lol
Apr 23 07:17:19 <zaeph>	What language do you use for work?
Apr 23 07:17:21 <Luyin>	well there's actually nothing I can write today because I've got other priorities right now
Apr 23 07:17:25 <Luyin>	python :)
Apr 23 07:17:47 <zaeph>	Nice.  Well, not that I can read any of it.
Apr 23 07:17:53 <zaeph>	Can't get out of the Elisp bubble.
Apr 23 07:23:49 <Luyin>	but...python!?
Apr 23 07:23:54 <Luyin>	what do you even do here?
Apr 23 07:23:54 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 23 07:24:15 <zaeph>	I've been keeping our maintainers on their toe, telling them that I'd eventually get to Python!
Apr 23 07:24:55 <Luyin>	lol
Apr 23 07:25:00 <Luyin>	so you're just another troll? ;)
Apr 23 07:25:05 <zaeph>	But it's more a matter of time than a matter of will.  The training this year has kept me quite busy, and I hope that in a couple of weeks, things will settle into a much more balanced rhythm.
Apr 23 07:25:22 <zaeph>	I'm the worst kind of troll: the literate kind.
Apr 23 07:25:32 <zaeph>	My trolling is enlightened by the reading I've done.
Apr 23 07:25:41 <Luyin>	all you trolling are belong to us!
Apr 23 07:26:26 <zaeph>	Well, I might be a troll, but I ain't slacking on the work, so get back to yours, as will I!
Apr 23 07:26:53 <zaeph>	More seriously, I've got an hour-long podcast to finish by 9:45am, so I've got no time to spare. :D
Apr 23 07:26:57 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 23 07:26:59 <Luyin>	go go
Apr 23 07:27:01 <Luyin>	hf gl
Apr 23 07:27:15 <zaeph>	Thanks, good luck for work, or whatever more important thigns you've got going right now.  Bye!
Apr 23 09:05:28 <Luyin>	zaeph: I stand corrected. I've actually written a short script already :)
Apr 23 09:19:02 <zaeph>	Luyin: You monster!
Apr 23 09:19:08 <zaeph>	You should enjoy the 'Rona break!

Apr 23 10:52:05 <tomasi>	Hi guys.. is there any possibility how to put ranger to commandline stuff and than switch it back to foreground?
Apr 23 10:52:22 <tomasi>	like MC "Ctrl+O"
Apr 23 10:52:25 <zaeph>	tomasi: `S`
Apr 23 10:52:29 <zaeph>	I think it's default.
Apr 23 10:52:39 <zaeph>	It opens ranger in cwd.
Apr 23 10:52:50 <zaeph>	Can't help you more, I'm in the middle of an exam, cutting off irc now!
Apr 23 10:52:51 <tomasi>	ok... it works..
Apr 23 10:52:54 <zaeph>	Good!
Apr 23 10:52:57 <tomasi>	and back?
Apr 23 10:53:25 <zaeph>	tomasi: Ctrl-D in your terminal
Apr 23 10:53:36 <zaeph>	Let me know if it works so I can go back to work. :p
Apr 23 10:53:44 <tomasi>	:-* thx.. 
Apr 23 10:53:49 <zaeph>	Splendid, bye!
Apr 23 10:53:56 <tomasi>	GL with your exam ;)
Apr 23 12:08:18 <zaeph>	Aight, two more to go.
Apr 23 12:14:12 <__monty__>	Good luck!
Apr 23 12:14:34 <zaeph>	Thanks!  First one should go all right, less sure about the second one.
Apr 23 12:15:06 <zaeph>	It's about using digital technologies to improve our teaching, and honestly, I couldn't be arsed following that one.  It was all about using web-platforms to design interactive platforms for our students.
Apr 23 12:15:10 <zaeph>	All of them were proprietary, obviously.
Apr 23 12:41:29 <Luyin>	zaeph: meh
Apr 23 12:41:33 <Luyin>	zaeph: sounds stupid
Apr 23 12:41:42 <Luyin>	zaeph: but glad you're done with the whole stuff soon :)
Apr 23 12:41:48 <zaeph>	Luyin: Yay!
Apr 23 12:42:41 <zaeph>	4h of written work tomorrow, 30 pages to write during the weekend, and then I'm *done*.

Apr 23 15:48:22 <zaeph>	We were actually supposed to get a raise before the 'Rona.  Not sure if it's going to happen now.
Apr 23 15:48:22 <__monty__>	Net? And is that with a civil servant statute?
Apr 23 15:48:33 <zaeph>	Yes to both.
Apr 23 15:48:59 <zaeph>	(And just to be clear, 1600 EUR is plenty enough for me, living alone.)
Apr 23 15:49:11 <__monty__>	Then I don't think you should be complaining, especially for france.
Apr 23 15:49:31 <zaeph>	Complaining is part of the trade, that's what my union is telling me anyway. ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

Apr 23 17:42:19 <__monty__>	It's a way to freeze and resume terminal output when a command has logorhea.
Apr 23 17:42:26 <__monty__>	Yah.
Apr 23 17:42:38 <zaeph>	Oh, cool.  Thanks for letting me know!
Apr 23 17:42:57 <__monty__>	But it's a terminal feature. Imo ranger has no business modyfing people's configuration.
Apr 23 17:43:23 <zaeph>	Same feeling here.
Apr 23 17:44:29 <__monty__>	It'd be like changing PATH or XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
Apr 23 17:44:36 <zaeph>	Yikes.
Apr 23 17:44:37 <__monty__>	All things you *can* do.
Apr 23 17:44:45 <__monty__>	And all things that might be valid to do.
Apr 23 17:44:51 <zaeph>	Think about all the things we could do!!

Apr 23 17:44:58 <zaeph>	Eeeevil.

Apr 23 17:57:34 <Sout>	then you need to figure out how to make the dried pasta :D (since those usually do not have eggs
Apr 23 17:58:06 <zaeph>	Uhm, I need to look that up, then.  Thanks!
Apr 23 18:00:51 <Luyin>	zaeph: vegan here too, I found a vegan recipe for it :)
Apr 23 18:00:53 <Luyin>	zaeph: \o/
Apr 23 18:00:57 <Sout>	http://www.30poundsofapples.com/2012/01/homemade-dried-pasta/
Apr 23 18:01:08 <Sout>	yeah dried pasta is usually just flower and water
Apr 23 18:01:35 <zaeph>	Aw, that looks tasty!
Apr 23 18:03:15 <zaeph>	I'll try it out and let you know how I like it!
Apr 23 18:03:16 <Luyin>	zaeph: https://minimalistbaker.com/basic-vegan-french-toast/ in case you're interested
Apr 23 18:03:38 <__monty__>	Does this mean you don't wear any leather?
Apr 23 18:03:47 <zaeph>	Yup.
Apr 23 18:03:59 <zaeph>	The only legacy things I have are my wallet and my pouch for storing coins.
Apr 23 18:04:03 <Luyin>	can be a big bummer on fetish parties!
Apr 23 18:04:12 <zaeph>	I prefer nudist colonies.
Apr 23 18:04:13 <__monty__>	Do you require your wine to be vegan?
Apr 23 18:04:26 <zaeph>	I've solved the issue a different way: I don't usually drink wine.
Apr 23 18:04:35 <zaeph>	But when I do, nah, I don't actually check online if the wine is vegan.
Apr 23 18:04:42 <__monty__>	La naturisme c'est super!
Apr 23 18:04:55 <Luyin>	zaeph: haha I'm nudist too
Apr 23 18:04:58 <zaeph>	It is indeed, but it's a bit more masculine than you made it out to be. :3
Apr 23 18:05:18 <zaeph>	(i.e. le*)
Apr 23 18:05:27 <__monty__>	Aww.
Apr 23 18:05:37 <zaeph>	Don't 'aww' me young man!
Apr 23 18:05:49 <zaeph>	Luyin: Man, those pictures are tasty. -.-
Apr 23 18:05:53 <__monty__>	I definitely prefer female naturism though.
Apr 23 18:05:57 <zaeph>	I'm more of a salty dude (eh) than a sweet tooth.
Apr 23 18:06:11 <zaeph>	__monty__: I'll take any naturism I can get.
Apr 23 18:06:15 <zaeph>	Not picky.
Apr 23 18:06:19 <__monty__>	Must come in handy when servicing your friends : >
Apr 23 18:06:34 <zaeph>	Don't bring the DDoS again.
Apr 23 18:06:36 <zaeph>	up*
Apr 23 18:07:28 <Luyin>	damn, I broke a wine glass
Apr 23 18:07:58 <zaeph>	Luyin: It's OK, I forgive you.
Apr 23 18:09:20 <Luyin>	zaeph: that's nice of you, only it doesn't bring me back the wine glass, nor mitigates the shards I have to clean away now
Apr 23 18:09:46 <zaeph>	Wow, rude.  Trying to help here.
Apr 23 18:10:07 <zaeph>	Sending my thoughts and prayers your way.
Apr 23 18:10:16 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 23 18:10:24 <Luyin>	accept my gratitude, kind sir <3
Apr 23 20:01:02 <__monty__>	Is this a zen koan? https://github.com/ranger/ranger/pull/1931#issuecomment-618555212
Apr 23 20:01:38 <__monty__>	I'm pretty sure they're conflating at least two but maybe three of their PRs in that one comment.
Apr 23 21:42:46 <zaeph>	__monty__: I need to consult the scriptures to answer that.

Apr 23 22:32:41 *	Topic for #ranger set by __monty__!~toonn@unaffiliated/toonn (Tue Feb 12 19:41:59 2019)
Apr 23 22:33:36 <__monty__>	nn, peeps
Apr 23 22:33:43 <zaeph>	Bye!
Apr 23 22:33:45 <zaeph>	Gotcha!
Apr 24 07:55:01 <Luyin>	howdi, rangers!
Apr 24 07:55:05 <zaeph>	Luyin: Heya!
Apr 24 07:56:07 <Luyin>	somebody recently recommended I update one of ranger's config files, because I found this weird behaviour when I use "r" and the command lines says literally ":open_with%space". Which file was that again?
Apr 24 07:56:33 <zaeph>	Luyin: Probably rc.conf.
Apr 24 07:57:00 <zaeph>	I think we've recently changed the way the escaping works in some commands in order to not have `%%` for expanding chain-commands.
Apr 24 07:57:03 <Luyin>	zaeph: thanks, I'll check it out
Apr 24 07:57:12 <zaeph>	Any time!
Apr 24 08:51:44 <Luyin>	and now for something completely different: http://bracha.org/Site/Theology.html
Apr 24 08:51:49 <Luyin>	zaeph: you might enjoy this ^
Apr 24 08:52:16 <zaeph>	Luyin: I'll have a read in a bit.
Apr 24 08:52:44 <Luyin>	no hurry
Apr 24 08:52:53 <Luyin>	the internet doesn't run off just because you're busier now :D
Apr 24 08:53:07 <zaeph>	…Yet.
Apr 24 08:53:18 <zaeph>	I mean, I wouldn't have thought that they'd cap the internet in the US, and here we are.
Apr 24 08:53:33 <zaeph>	With so-called fast-lanes and whatnot to get 'faster' internet which used to be the default.
Apr 24 08:54:12 <Luyin>	yeah...
Apr 24 09:30:11 <zaeph>	Luyin: Finally got around to reading it.  I wanna be a Computional Eschatologist, then!
Apr 24 09:30:18 <zaeph>	(FYI: 'The part of theology concerned with death, judgement, and the final destiny of the soul and of humankind')
Apr 24 09:31:39 <Luyin>	zaeph: :D
Apr 24 09:31:49 <Luyin>	lol
Apr 24 09:32:07 <Luyin>	like the "don't ask me to fix this bug in your legacy code OR ELSE" feeling? :D
Apr 24 09:32:22 <zaeph>	Luyin: Pretty much, yes.
Apr 24 11:00:32 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)
Apr 24 11:02:12 <zaeph>	Hi grobi!
Apr 24 11:03:04 <zaeph>	__monty__: Read a nice Elisp article by daddy-jwiegley this morning: http://newartisans.com/2016/01/pattern-matching-with-pcase/
Apr 24 11:03:30 <zaeph>	Completely blew me away with what you could do with pcase.
Apr 24 11:03:34 <grobi>	hi zaeph i can now command ranger with my eyes
Apr 24 11:04:30 <zaeph>	Oh nice, with those little webcam that track your eyes movements?
Apr 24 11:05:04 <grobi>	knoppix comes with viacam and xvkbd
Apr 24 11:05:42 <zaeph>	Sweet!  Must come in handy for a lot of handicapped folks.
Apr 24 11:05:51 <__monty__>	That sounds awesome.
Apr 24 11:06:17 <grobi>	and it has a speach boot option wich starts programs in a console from where you can enter the graphical mode as well
Apr 24 11:06:37 <zaeph>	Does that mean you can tell your computer to rm your root?
Apr 24 11:06:43 <zaeph>	Nice~
Apr 24 11:06:55 <grobi>	no that not
Apr 24 11:07:06 <zaeph>	Bummer!
Apr 24 11:07:18 <grobi>	you have to enter the boot options by F2
Apr 24 11:07:48 <grobi>	then F3 and choose youre options by keyboard
Apr 24 11:09:06 <grobi>	there is not yet a possibility to command programs espially terminals by voice i guess
Apr 24 11:09:28 <zaeph>	I mean, it wouldn't be very practical anyway.  Terminals are good when you have access to a keyboard, and a physical one at that.
Apr 24 11:09:40 <zaeph>	Termux on your phone is kinda bad.
Apr 24 11:10:02 <grobi>	but it reads the rograms
Apr 24 11:10:29 <grobi>	you can command with your eyes with the virtual keyboard
Apr 24 11:10:43 <zaeph>	Yeah, but it'd take ages.
Apr 24 11:10:43 <grobi>	xvkbd
Apr 24 11:10:57 <grobi>	you need to exercise thats true
Apr 24 11:11:42 <zaeph>	The average typist can probably do 400 characters/min.  If you did as many eye-movements, and that's supposing that you've got 100% accuracy with viacam, you'd probably be dizzy by the end of it.
Apr 24 11:11:59 <zaeph>	But accessibility isn't about speed, so it's awesome :D
Apr 24 11:12:09 <grobi>	there is automatic click option and you can click with closing your eyelids
Apr 24 11:12:36 <zaeph>	Sounds like you'd get a lot of misclicks, unless there is a special duration for your eye to be closed.
Apr 24 11:12:49 <zaeph>	Like, >50 ms, it's considered as a click.  But then we get problems with the FPS on the webcam.
Apr 24 11:12:56 <grobi>	just blink and blinkblink
Apr 24 11:13:06 <zaeph>	…Man, it's a nightmare to think of all the possibilities.
Apr 24 11:13:59 <grobi>	yes the ms-option is configurable by the automatic click-option, so you can choose.
Apr 24 11:14:35 <grobi>	you can configure the keyboard as well 
Apr 24 11:14:54 <grobi>	just the look is very awfull
Apr 24 11:15:00 <zaeph>	It's nice to have a libre tool for handling all this, though.
Apr 24 11:15:25 <grobi>	maybe i try onboard
Apr 24 11:17:07 <grobi>	its like magic to move your windows around
Apr 24 11:18:02 <zaeph>	Just imagine placing extra modifiers on your screen.  Better than footpedals! /s
Apr 24 11:18:58 <grobi>	:))
Apr 24 11:31:41 <grobi>	i wrote this with my eyes :) ,but landed in the wrong channel by accident
Apr 24 11:32:04 <zaeph>	So you almost posted this in #midnightcommander?
Apr 24 11:32:15 <zaeph>	They wouldn't have minded.
Apr 24 11:32:21 <grobi>	lol
Apr 24 11:33:40 <grobi>	one can configure onboard as well and have several own created layouts and switch inbetween
Apr 24 11:36:25 <grobi>	so one can create a shell-command per key! on each layout (they called it macro)
Apr 24 11:36:52 <zaeph>	Nice.  I like that this offers a lot of possibility.
Apr 24 11:37:21 <grobi>	you can have 16 macros by default 
Apr 24 11:37:43 <grobi>	and i guess you could use even more
Apr 24 11:38:32 <grobi>	so count the commands you can offer
Apr 24 11:38:51 <grobi>	the macros can be named as well
Apr 24 11:39:21 <grobi>	so you will get not tooooooo confused by this
Apr 24 11:39:50 <grobi>	well omboardwill be it i guess
Apr 24 12:01:00 <Luyin>	sooo, I just vimdiffed my rc.conf versus the /usr/share/doc one. seems I missed a lot of changes :D
Apr 24 12:01:18 <Luyin>	should probably only write my _changes_ from the default settings in my ~ one
Apr 24 12:01:23 <zaeph>	Luyin: I did the same about 3 weeks ago.
Apr 24 12:01:32 <zaeph>	I finally have the 'use xdg-open as last resort' in my rifle.conf!
Apr 24 12:01:48 <Luyin>	I assume this stuff is added, not overwritten? so if I don't define a value in my local rc.conf, the higher-level value is taken?
Apr 24 12:02:12 <zaeph>	Yeah, your custom config is run on top of the default.
Apr 24 12:02:16 <zaeph>	…If I remember properly.
Apr 24 12:20:10 <vifon>	__monty__: It's a shame we're well past 1 April.  https://jdan.github.io/98.css/
Apr 24 12:20:20 <vifon>	A website redesign is due.
Apr 24 12:20:54 <zaeph>	vifon: Oh this is great.
Apr 24 12:20:54 <vifon>	(though what you did was excellent too)
Apr 24 12:20:54 <zaeph>	love the old Windows aesthetic.
Apr 24 12:21:26 <vifon>	ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ
Apr 24 12:21:58 <zaeph>	I'd put some vaporwave emojis right about now if your term could display them.
Apr 24 12:37:45 *	Luyin aims a cannon at that website
Apr 24 12:38:03 <Luyin>	webservers should refuse to pass out websites with such a design!
Apr 24 12:38:35 <zaeph>	Luyin: You philistine.  You don't know what true art is.
Apr 24 12:39:29 <Luyin>	:)
Apr 24 12:48:32 <__monty__>	vifon: : )
Apr 24 12:49:11 <blawiz>	vifon: have you tried click and drag with qmk-kb-mouse?
Apr 24 12:49:18 <__monty__>	Luyin: Ranger loads the default rc, maybe one in /etc (can't remember which files are loaded from there) and your user config. *Unless* you set RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC=False.
Apr 24 12:49:51 <__monty__>	Then it will only load the user config (and the one in etc but I think that's only rifle and commands.py).
Apr 24 12:50:35 <zaeph>	__monty__: Have you gotten to the bottom of things with your non-native guy, btw?
Apr 24 12:50:41 <zaeph>	Have you found the answers to the meaning of life?
Apr 24 12:51:42 <vifon>	blawiz: I think so, yes.
Apr 24 12:52:02 <zaeph>	Can it actually work with the firmware?
Apr 24 12:52:24 <zaeph>	Like, the keyboard would simulate a click on any computer?
Apr 24 12:53:41 <__monty__>	zaeph: I think I understand 3 of his 5 PRs now. The code isn't very usable though : /
Apr 24 12:54:18 <zaeph>	How is he taking it?
Apr 24 12:54:19 <vifon>	zaeph: The keeb registers as a keyboard, a mouse and even a joystick IIRC.
Apr 24 12:54:19 <zaeph>	vifon: Nice!
Apr 24 12:54:19 <vifon>	It can send events as all these devices.
Apr 24 12:54:28 <__monty__>	vifon: console not shell-escaping macros is confusing people. You think it'd be ok to default to escaping and provie a --no-shell-escapes flag we can use with the mappings that need it?
Apr 24 12:54:52 <zaeph>	vifon: Can it make my tea?
Apr 24 12:54:59 <__monty__>	vifon: Or do you think a new escape_console command is a better alternative?
Apr 24 12:56:14 <vifon>	Not escaping how?
Apr 24 12:56:48 <zaeph>	I believe we're talking about the %%space.
Apr 24 12:56:55 <zaeph>	…Or maybe not.
Apr 24 12:56:55 <__monty__>	No, that's still unavoidable for now.
Apr 24 12:57:25 <__monty__>	vifon: map a console shell mv %s %f
Apr 24 12:57:55 <vifon>	Wouldn't it get expanded even before calling :console?
Apr 24 12:57:55 <__monty__>	Those macros will be substituted in a "console" context, which doesn't do shell escaping. And then passed to the shell command.
Apr 24 12:57:58 <__monty__>	No, console doesn't do shell escaping of macros.
Apr 24 12:58:11 <__monty__>	Consider `console touch %s`.
Apr 24 12:58:20 <__monty__>	You don't need shell escaping for `:touch`.
Apr 24 12:58:32 <__monty__>	Because you'd create a file with apostrophes.
Apr 24 12:58:36 <vifon>	For me it does, I got :touch [whatever I had focused]
Apr 24 13:01:15 <__monty__>	vifon: But you're doing `:touch %s`?
Apr 24 13:01:31 <__monty__>	And of course it works currently, because we don't shell escape.
Apr 24 13:02:04 <__monty__>	vifon: If we did shell escape you'd get `:touch 'file'`.
Apr 24 13:03:13 <zaeph>	So much PDA up in here.
Apr 24 13:03:13 <__monty__>	vifon: That should be our next April fool's. It's glorious.
Apr 24 13:03:17 <blawiz>	vifon: cool
Apr 24 13:03:17 <zaeph>	I feel mildly uncomfortable.
Apr 24 13:03:51 <vifon>	PDA?
Apr 24 13:04:04 <vifon>	Ah.
Apr 24 13:04:10 <zaeph>	Public Display of Affection.
Apr 24 13:04:10 <zaeph>	With so much touching.
Apr 24 13:04:42 <vifon>	__monty__: I cannot focus on it right now, I've got a deadline in like 2h.
Apr 24 13:05:10 <vifon>	I'll get back to you and if I won't, please bother me later.
Apr 24 13:05:19 <zaeph>	Oh he will.
Apr 24 13:05:31 <__monty__>	vifon: Okidoke.
Apr 24 13:05:44 <vifon>	zaeph: Dear Frenglishman, is "bother" considered offensive?
Apr 24 13:06:16 <__monty__>	Oooh, like "frenemy" but for english majors? : >
Apr 24 13:06:19 <zaeph>	It's deeply rooted in English culture that whenever you need to disturb/bother/hit up somebody, it's never nice because you're interrupting them.
Apr 24 13:06:25 <vifon>	Can you propose a more neutral word?
Apr 24 13:06:45 <zaeph>	No, because the English haven't figured out how to *not* be offended when they get disturbed.
Apr 24 13:06:50 <vifon>	:D
Apr 24 13:06:58 <zaeph>	So 'bother' is completely fine.
Apr 24 13:07:39 <zaeph>	Maybe the technological 'beep me later' or 'ring me later' might be a little more neutral, but they're slightly different.
Apr 24 13:07:52 <vifon>	__monty__: Boop me later.
Apr 24 13:08:16 <zaeph>	Now you've just made it weird.
Apr 24 13:09:07 <__monty__>	Hit me up later is definitely friendlier than "bother me later," that implies you're currently being bothered while the former is more "don't have time rn, bring it up again later."
Apr 24 13:09:32 <__monty__>	But I wasn't offended, no worries ; )
Apr 24 13:09:39 <zaeph>	Yeah, now I can see it.  Sorry, my instincts are rusty today.
Apr 24 13:17:41 <Luyin>	:terminal in ranger doesn't start any terminals for me. Could this have to do with either using zsh as my SHELL or with termite as the emulator?
Apr 24 13:18:18 <vifon>	Luyin: Do you have TERMCMD set?
Apr 24 13:18:23 <Luyin>	when I switch to bash (`/bin/bash; ranger -> :terminal` it starts a terminal, so must have to do with ZSH
Apr 24 13:18:33 <zaeph>	It works for me, opening terminator.
Apr 24 13:18:43 <zaeph>	(Which, yes, __monty__, I just modified to `kitty`.)
Apr 24 13:18:50 <Luyin>	vifon: ah, might be TERCMD isn't set in my zshenv
Apr 24 13:18:50 <zaeph>	Only one way to find out!
Apr 24 13:19:37 <Luyin>	hu, it isn't set in either bash nor zsh environments
Apr 24 13:19:37 <Luyin>	weird
Apr 24 13:19:56 <vifon>	~/.profile?
Apr 24 13:19:56 <zaeph>	Don't you have it set up in your Xprofile or whatnot?
Apr 24 13:20:17 <Luyin>	phew, because I have no idea how all this stuff works
Apr 24 13:20:22 <Luyin>	:D
Apr 24 13:20:41 <Luyin>	some time™ I'll take care of that
Apr 24 13:20:45 <zaeph>	Eh, you figure out along the way, across breakages.
Apr 24 13:20:47 <Luyin>	hehe yeah
Apr 24 13:20:52 <zaeph>	All you need is just to plop `export TERMCMD="kitty"` in it.
Apr 24 13:21:06 <vifon>	> plop
Apr 24 13:21:10 <zaeph>	vifon: I use this word a lot lately. :<
Apr 24 13:21:28 <vifon>	I've been eating, zaeph.
Apr 24 13:21:32 <zaeph>	I've been plopping, vifon .
Apr 24 13:21:34 <vifon>	I will.
Apr 24 13:21:42 <zaeph>	Be my guest.
Apr 24 14:13:08 <zaeph>	How did I end up watching Wii Music renditions of the USSR National Anthem, I know not.  But boy am I proud.
Apr 24 14:34:11 <Luyin>	:D

Oct 16 09:18:14 <zaeph>	Luyin: Hi there.
Oct 16 09:18:46 <zaeph>	I've got a meeting in 2h to officially offer my resigniation to my school.  Still feeling antsy about it.
Oct 16 09:27:01 <Luyin>	sorry to hear that :(
Oct 16 09:27:11 <Luyin>	but after what you said the other day, it's probably the best for you
Oct 16 09:27:39 <zaeph>	Definitely.  I've got good stuff on the horizon, stuff that motivates me far more than teaching middleschoolers could ever do for m.
Oct 16 09:28:08 <zaeph>	I mean, yeah, it's going to be a little stressful, but I'd rather have that stress than the boredom.
Oct 16 09:34:31 <eyJhb>	Luyin: HI!!
Oct 16 09:34:38 <zaeph>	eyJhb: STOP YELLING!
Oct 16 09:34:48 <eyJhb>	zaeph: WHAT?!
Oct 16 09:35:01 <zaeph>	🙄
Oct 16 09:36:17 <eyJhb>	What?
Oct 16 09:36:39 <zaeph>	eyJhb: You fully know 'what', young man.
Oct 16 09:37:26 <eyJhb>	You don't know if I am young, or just old ? :o
Oct 16 09:48:56 <Luyin>	hi eyJhb o/
Oct 16 10:27:36 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)

Oct 16 10:36:08 <Luyin>	perfect, just what I needed. grobi take that!
Oct 16 10:41:24 <grobi>	hi Luyin, thanks!
Oct 16 10:43:07 <Luyin>	;)
Oct 16 11:46:06 <vifon>	zaeph: Aand?
Oct 16 12:29:53 <Luyin>	our landlord has just offered us the flat for buying
Oct 16 12:30:09 <vifon>	Buying-buying?
Oct 16 12:42:36 <GermainZ>	zaeph: consider pissing on the table
Oct 16 12:44:23 <vifon>	To assert dominance, yes.

Oct 16 19:44:42 <zaeph>	GermainZ: You promised me a fun evening.  You lied.
Oct 16 19:46:11 <GermainZ>	zaeph: did you get food stuff?
Oct 16 19:46:20 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I did. :)
Oct 16 19:46:37 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what did you get?
Oct 16 19:47:07 <GermainZ>	I should eat. brb.
Oct 16 19:47:16 <zaeph>	Well nothing fancy-fancy, but they finally had my favourite cereal bars back in stock.  Some OJ, too.
Oct 16 19:47:25 <zaeph>	…It's not much, but I needed my sugar fix.
Oct 16 19:48:28 <__monty__>	Wow, cereal bars and orange juice? Lah-dee-dah, aren't we fancy? 🧐
Oct 16 19:48:31 <__monty__>	┌─┐
Oct 16 19:48:31 <__monty__>	┴─┴
Oct 16 19:48:31 <__monty__>	ಠ_ರೃ
Oct 16 19:49:26 <zaeph>	__monty__: I was drained today.  Quit my job as a teacher.  Mind you, that was before the news.  If I had any second-thoughts before, they're not there anymore.
Oct 16 19:51:16 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	happy for you about that, at least
Oct 16 19:51:38 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	I don't know about the abuse you talked about, haven't been following the chat recently
Oct 16 19:52:44 <__monty__>	Yeah, exciting.
Oct 16 19:52:59 <__monty__>	Please be a foss posterchild.
Oct 16 19:53:27 <zaeph>	tr1pw1r3[m]: It's just that they're trying to work me more than I currently am, despite the fact that I'm getting good results with my students.  To ensure that I do so, they wanted to impose a strict prep regimen which I couldn't follow whilst keeping my second job.
Oct 16 19:54:20 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	the programming gig?
Oct 16 19:54:47 <zaeph>	The whole point of teaching this year was to ensure my transition to tech and floss.  I'd have wanted to wait an extra couple of months to err on the side of caution, but leaving now is fine too.
Oct 16 19:54:55 <zaeph>	__monty__: You can count on me. :)
Oct 16 19:56:08 <zaeph>	I've got three contracts lined up until the end of 2020, and two different conferences which I'm attending.  So, the transition will be pretty smooth.
Oct 16 19:57:29 <zaeph>	tr1pw1r3[m]: Re 'abuse', whilst they were definitely being pushy and putting pressure on me, I'm not feeling 'abused' insofar as I know that I have something on the side.  But I'm pretty sure they deploy the same repressive arsenal with everyone.
Oct 16 19:57:53 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	:S
Oct 16 19:57:59 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	good that you can leave that crap behind
Oct 16 19:58:29 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	I quit my job too, two weeks ago
Oct 16 19:58:44 <zaeph>	Is that a good or bad news for you?
Oct 16 19:58:56 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	they were trying to rewrite a 100-person-year software suite in 5 person-years
Oct 16 19:59:19 <zaeph>	Did you refer them to a math teacher?
Oct 16 19:59:39 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	math is left to the computers
Oct 16 19:59:54 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	we're halfway in, and it's of course not going well
Oct 16 20:00:19 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	don't want to be there when the house of cards collapses
Oct 16 20:00:21 <zaeph>	Sorry that you had to quit.  Hopefully you'll be able to find a new gig soon.
Oct 16 20:00:34 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	but at least there was no pressure on me. everybody just pretends that everything is fine :D
Oct 16 20:01:29 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	I can relate to your sense of uncertainty about the future tho
Oct 16 20:02:28 <zaeph>	Well, for me, it's the nature of freelancing.  I've got a good coach/colleague to support me, though, so I'm in a pretty stellar scenario as far as 'uncertain futures' go.
Oct 16 20:03:30 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	lucky :)
Oct 16 20:03:33 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	it'll be ok for me too
Oct 16 20:03:54 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	I plan to take a little break and maybe work on open source again
Oct 16 20:04:11 <tr1pw1r3[m]>	or play skyrim and suddenly 2021 is over
Oct 16 20:04:17 <zaeph>	I'll be okay as long as __monty__ doesn't go Jehova's Witness on me and talk to me about our lord and saviour 'contributing to ranger'.
Oct 16 20:35:26 <zaeph>	Oh god, it keeps getting worse.  There are photos trending on Twitter. _-_
Oct 16 20:38:18 <__monty__>	Definitely gonna stay away then.
Oct 16 20:38:30 <zaeph>	Yeah, definitely avoid the trending stuff.
Oct 16 20:38:52 <__monty__>	No problem, I'll just avoid twitter in its entirety, like always.
Oct 16 20:39:27 <zaeph>	…Actually sounds like a plan right now.
Oct 16 20:39:42 <vifon>	zaeph: What photos?
Oct 16 20:40:09 <zaeph>	vifon: Of the aftermath.
Oct 16 20:41:01 <vifon>	Gore?
Oct 16 20:41:05 <zaeph>	Yeah.
Oct 16 20:44:24 <GermainZ>	tr1pw1r3[m] is hut, right?
Oct 16 20:44:39 <zaeph>	Oh, I completely forgot that. :D
Oct 16 20:45:04 <zaeph>	I was lamenting the fact that you weren't around the other day.
Oct 16 20:45:20 <__monty__>	Smh, am I no longer a hipster when it comes to being jobless?
Oct 16 20:45:48 <zaeph>	__monty__: Does it make getting a job the new black? :3
Oct 16 20:46:02 <zaeph>	Or, well, the *old* black in the case of hipsters.
Oct 16 20:46:08 <__monty__>	Nah, I'll just have to get creative.
Oct 16 20:46:35 <GermainZ>	tr1pw1r3[m]: what was that software about, out of curiosity?
Oct 16 20:46:43 <zaeph>	__monty__: Mildly upsetting video, but worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ
Oct 16 20:47:03 <zaeph>	It's Don't Hug Me I'm Scared, for those of you in the know.
Oct 16 20:47:35 <zaeph>	(This was prompted by 'get creative'.)
Oct 16 20:47:44 <__monty__>	Not sure I want to watch it.
Oct 16 20:47:53 <zaeph>	Then don't.
Oct 16 20:47:59 <GermainZ>	I'll watch it for you
Oct 16 20:48:10 <zaeph>	No reason to join me on the 'traumatised' bench.
Oct 16 20:48:31 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Tell me how traumatizing it was afterwards.
Oct 16 20:50:25 <vifon>	OK, give me the traumatizing link.
Oct 16 20:50:39 <vifon>	I'll defuse it for you, my gf is into gore, she'll enjoy it.
Oct 16 20:50:57 <zaeph>	vifon: <zaeph> __monty__: Mildly upsetting video, but worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C_HReR_McQ 
Oct 16 20:51:47 <GermainZ>	__monty__: meh, wouldn't say it's traumatizing, just mildly weird. It's kinda going for that "le random video" effect
Oct 16 20:52:07 <zaeph>	GermainZ: The whole series is like this.
Oct 16 20:52:07 <vifon>	Yep.
Oct 16 20:52:21 <zaeph>	I agree that it's a tad 'meh', but it marred the 'get creative' forever for me.
Oct 16 20:52:28 <GermainZ>	__monty__: there's some minced meat that's probably meant to evoke images of gore, that's the most shocking thing about the video
Oct 16 20:52:31 <vifon>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_h2G6QMMjA
Oct 16 20:52:35 <vifon>	*This* is traumatizing.
Oct 16 20:52:39 <zaeph>	Risky click.
Oct 16 20:52:46 <zaeph>	Yup, not watching that.
Oct 16 20:53:20 <vifon>	zaeph: Do it!
Oct 16 20:53:27 <GermainZ>	I'm watching it
Oct 16 20:53:37 <GermainZ>	It's definitely weirder
Oct 16 20:54:06 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Masochist.
Oct 16 20:55:19 <GermainZ>	I guess it's what someone who's very high would make if you asked him to make a C thriller/horror movie
Oct 16 20:56:35 <vifon>	This is my go-to video when I need a weird one.
Oct 16 20:56:40 <GermainZ>	It's definitely going for that "le random video" effect as well
Oct 16 20:58:49 <vifon>	Watch it with us, zaeph!
Oct 16 20:58:58 <zaeph>	vifon: Oh hell no.
Oct 16 20:59:20 <zaeph>	I get easily weirded out by videos at night, and I've had my fair share of unease for the whole weekend today.
Oct 16 20:59:31 <vifon>	You need an overflow.
Oct 16 20:59:56 <vifon>	Oh shit, there's more.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0g5QbWTkLo
Oct 16 21:01:36 <__monty__>	Not watching *any* of these.
Oct 16 21:01:46 <__monty__>	Please stop trying to le waste my time. tyvm
Oct 16 21:02:38 <GermainZ>	You're really not missing anything
Oct 16 21:03:08 <vifon>	GermainZ: The subtitles don't fully convey the weirdness of it.
Oct 16 21:04:22 <zaeph>	__monty__: Here's one off the 'good' pile to compensate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKGk3rzf9Ys
Oct 16 21:07:24 <GermainZ>	zaeph: heh
Oct 16 21:08:04 <__monty__>	Not gonna fall for such an obvious Rickroll.
Oct 16 21:08:21 <GermainZ>	__monty__: it's not
Oct 16 21:08:33 <GermainZ>	I found it fairly funny. It's 8 seconds long
Oct 16 21:08:36 <zaeph>	It's better.
Oct 16 21:09:10 <__monty__>	Have some weird in return, https://youtu.be/QcYdQcwVFDs
Oct 16 21:09:13 <zaeph>	It's also a good philosophy.
Oct 16 21:09:22 <__monty__>	I don't like star wars memes. They're always weaksauce.
Oct 16 21:09:45 <zaeph>	Fine…
Oct 16 21:09:50 *	zaeph browses his 'good' pile.
Oct 16 21:10:26 <GermainZ>	__monty__: I find your lack of faith disturbing
Oct 16 21:10:51 <zaeph>	This one's a classic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebVLJUwR62U
Oct 16 21:11:02 <GermainZ>	vifon: G502 or G703… mhm…
Oct 16 21:11:29 <GermainZ>	vifon: the G703 looks less like a spaceship, which I like. The G502 has more buttons
Oct 16 21:13:55 <__monty__>	Get a non-deadend pointing device.
Oct 16 21:14:17 <zaeph>	Oh here we go again.
Oct 16 21:14:18 <vifon>	GermainZ: Cleaning G502 is a PITA.
Oct 16 21:14:24 <vifon>	__monty__: Like?
Oct 16 21:14:24 <zaeph>	ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
Oct 16 21:14:31 <GermainZ>	vifon: how do you clean it?
Oct 16 21:14:39 <GermainZ>	__monty__: non-deadend?
Oct 16 21:14:39 <__monty__>	vifon: A decent trackpad.
Oct 16 21:14:53 <__monty__>	A wacom digitizer.
Oct 16 21:15:00 <__monty__>	A nice trackball.
Oct 16 21:15:04 <vifon>	GermainZ: A toothpick, or a micro-screwdriver of my Leatherman Wave.
Oct 16 21:15:13 <GermainZ>	I don't see how that fits my use case but okay
Oct 16 21:15:14 <vifon>	And in general: I don't.
Oct 16 21:15:16 <GermainZ>	vifon: mhm
Oct 16 21:15:31 <vifon>	Unless I actually start being disgusted by it.
Oct 16 21:16:57 <zaeph>	O'boy, I've got so much gold in my 'good' pile.
Oct 16 21:17:03 <vifon>	Stahp.
Oct 16 21:17:31 <zaeph>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qT51JUB9q8
Oct 16 21:17:36 <vifon>	Stahp or you will suffer my links later with a doubled force.
Oct 16 21:17:43 <GermainZ>	vifon: also, price is 77 vs 111
Oct 16 21:17:52 <vifon>	GermainZ: Which vs which?
Oct 16 21:17:59 <GermainZ>	vifon: G703 vs G502
Oct 16 21:18:14 <zaeph>	vifon: Try me bitch.
Oct 16 21:18:14 <vifon>	Can G703 switch sensitivity?
Oct 16 21:18:29 <vifon>	zaeph: Shiver me timbers.
Oct 16 21:18:49 <GermainZ>	vifon: what does that mean?
Oct 16 21:18:57 <zaeph>	GermainZ: It's gay code.
Oct 16 21:19:07 <vifon>	GermainZ: It's when you change the DPI to play some gay shooters.
Oct 16 21:19:25 <zaeph>	Star Wars ain't weak sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mift8241OI
Oct 16 21:19:32 <zaeph>	(Slightly loud.)
Oct 16 21:19:38 <GermainZ>	vifon: apparently
Oct 16 21:20:01 <vifon>	I guess you cannot go wrong with either.
Oct 16 21:20:26 <vifon>	I took the "opportunity" of buying a full gaming rig either way, so the price of a mouse was meaningless among other shit. :D
Oct 16 21:20:35 <GermainZ>	vifon: tho I'm not sure
Oct 16 21:20:52 <vifon>	Fine, you can go wrong with using a mouse.
Oct 16 21:20:54 <vifon>	Don't.
Oct 16 21:21:07 <vifon>	zaeph can explain you how.
Oct 16 21:21:34 <zaeph>	I did not use any mouse for 3y.
Oct 16 21:22:01 <zaeph>	…But when I got my new desk this summer, I plugged it back in, and I find it better for my use on two big monitors.
Oct 16 21:22:34 <vifon>	Yeah, that's how it was.  zaeph got his mouse stuck between his two monitors.
Oct 16 21:22:40 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 16 21:22:49 <zaeph>	Okay, last classic for tonight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc1P-AEaEp8
Oct 16 21:24:49 <GermainZ>	I think I'll go for the G502
Oct 16 21:26:29 <GermainZ>	vifon: do you use a mat?
Oct 16 21:26:52 <zaeph>	Such a yogi.
Oct 16 22:04:30 <zaeph>	Signing off, sleep tight everyone.
Oct 16 22:05:08 <vifon>	o/
Oct 16 22:07:46 <__monty__>	nn, zaeph

Oct 17 20:44:08 <zaeph>	So quiet today.
Oct 17 20:44:29 <eyJhb>	zaeph: NO
Oct 17 20:44:33 <zaeph>	Rude.
Oct 17 20:44:39 <eyJhb>	Hi
Oct 17 20:45:03 <zaeph>	Heya.
Oct 17 20:45:06 <eyJhb>	NO
Oct 17 20:45:12 <eyJhb>	What you doing tonight zaeph ?
Oct 17 20:45:44 <zaeph>	Not much.  Just had a chill day phoning friends.  I needed that to wash off the horrors of yesterday.
Oct 17 20:48:03 <eyJhb>	How did it go zaeph ?
Oct 17 20:50:11 <zaeph>	eyJhb: Yesterday, you mean?  Well, pretty horribly, considering the news.
Oct 17 20:50:17 <eyJhb>	I assume it is regarding the school etc. zaeph ? But my memory does suck
Oct 17 20:50:20 <eyJhb>	How come?
Oct 17 20:51:37 <zaeph>	eyJhb: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w172x2yy0z0qx57
Oct 17 20:52:09 <eyJhb>	What the hell
Oct 17 20:52:23 <eyJhb>	WHAT zaeph :|
Oct 17 20:53:10 <zaeph>	It happened 10 min away from where I live.
Oct 17 20:53:20 <eyJhb>	Damn
Oct 17 20:53:25 <eyJhb>	What the fuck
Oct 17 20:53:41 <eyJhb>	So... Do you still want to teach ? Did you know the person?
Oct 17 20:54:16 <zaeph>	I didn't know him, but I heard of the teacher before he was killed.  We were expecting things to escalate, but nowhere near to that.
Oct 17 20:54:33 <zaeph>	And no, I'm not planning to teach again, but I so happened to have wanted to quit *before* that happened.
Oct 17 20:54:47 <zaeph>	The timing is eerie nonetheless.
Oct 17 20:55:34 <eyJhb>	But weren't you going to have a meeting this week?
Oct 17 20:55:51 <zaeph>	eyJhb: I did, on Friday.  I announced that I was quitting.
Oct 17 20:56:02 <eyJhb>	This is insane. I do not hate on any that live the way of Islam, etc. but the extremist in any religion is INSANE
Oct 17 20:56:10 <eyJhb>	And it happened on the same day?
Oct 17 20:56:16 <zaeph>	Yup.
Oct 17 20:56:30 <eyJhb>	\brb I have to be social with the family. But I really hope that you are okay zaeph ! 
Oct 17 20:56:37 <eyJhb>	Sorry to hear all of this! :(
Oct 17 20:56:38 <zaeph>	Oh I am, don't worry.
Oct 17 20:56:56 <zaeph>	Lassie can find children in wells, I can predict killings apparently.
Oct 17 21:48:39 <zaeph>	I was an endless pool for my garden. ʕ ´•̥̥̥ ᴥ•̥̥̥`ʔ
Oct 17 21:49:52 <zaeph>	s/was/want/
Oct 17 22:00:27 <__monty__>	nn, peoples
Oct 17 22:08:35 <eyJhb>	zaeph: Daaark :p
Oct 17 22:16:50 <GermainZ>	zaeph: so it's not a parent but a teenager. Wew.
Oct 17 22:17:19 <GermainZ>	Not that it makes it any more or less fucked up
Oct 17 22:17:48 <zaeph>	GermainZ: The killer, you mean?
Oct 17 22:18:01 <GermainZ>	zaeph: yeah
Oct 17 22:18:13 <zaeph>	Yeah, but 18 yo... Come on.
Oct 17 22:18:22 <GermainZ>	zaeph: how do you mean?
Oct 17 22:18:45 <zaeph>	I'm still shocked by how young he was.  I mean, he's barely older than the kids I've been teaching.
Oct 17 22:18:52 <GermainZ>	Right
Oct 17 22:19:15 <GermainZ>	I agree it's very fucked up, but that level of fanaticism and brainwashing is often started younger
Oct 17 22:21:16 <zaeph>	True.  I wasn't making any comment on the radicalisation, merely on the age.  Whatever stuff he was fed growing up, 18yo is not a whole lot of experience in life, and what a fucked up one it must have been.
Oct 17 22:21:35 <GermainZ>	Yup
Oct 17 22:22:00 <GermainZ>	The sad thing is I don't see an obvious and quick solution either. Measures to counter this would take a generation or two
Oct 17 22:22:55 <zaeph>	Yeah, and probably even more than that.  You just can't snipe all those cradles of ideology like that.
Oct 17 22:24:06 <GermainZ>	Such a weird and vast dichotomy we live in
Oct 17 22:25:53 <zaeph>	Yeah…  I'm still too numb to think about it properly.

Oct 18 19:44:54 *	Topic for #ranger set by __monty__!~toonn@unaffiliated/toonn (Tue Feb 12 19:41:59 2019)
Oct 18 19:45:16 <GermainZ>	I don't know if it's a good idea, but an interview prep book might give you a solid overview of base CS concepts and work up your problem solving skills
Oct 18 19:45:25 <GermainZ>	(the good ones come with good summaries of important CS concepts)
Oct 18 19:45:41 <zaeph>	GermainZ: My co-maint recommended be a couple based on Python, but vifon wasn't too convinced.
Oct 18 19:45:57 <zaeph>	GermainZ: https://paste.xinu.at/1FM/
Oct 18 19:46:00 <GermainZ>	prep books usually aren't language-centric
Oct 18 19:46:09 <GermainZ>	the first is quite popular, yes
Oct 18 19:46:53 <__monty__>	I wouldn't expect them to be very thorough. But with zaeph's lack of... everything, I guess they could be a good sort of overview to identify topics you might want to look up.
Oct 18 19:46:56 <zaeph>	Re: problem-solving skills, https://teachyourselfcs.com/ recommends looking into books on algorithms.
Oct 18 19:47:37 <zaeph>	I'm as benighted as I look, whatcha want. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oct 18 19:48:43 <__monty__>	Hmm, I don't really support that.
Oct 18 19:48:51 <__monty__>	Everone's always talking about algorithms.
Oct 18 19:49:04 <__monty__>	Those were really the least useful part of my CS education.
Oct 18 19:49:22 <GermainZ>	__monty__: precisely, more of an overview without going too deep down into everything unless necessary 
Oct 18 19:49:36 <zaeph>	This book was recommended quite often, too: https://paste.xinu.at/i09P1S/
Oct 18 19:49:37 <__monty__>	Don't not-look at algorithms but don't focus on just algorithms.
Oct 18 19:49:53 <GermainZ>	I do think looking at and understanding algorithms is a good exercise for the brain. Don't memorize the algorithms or expect to use them, however
Oct 18 19:51:10 <zaeph>	The chief reason for my wanting to approach those big tomes is that I'd like to dive a a little lower with my languages.  Obviously, I need a GP, but with org-roam and the rust parser, I think I'm going to need more knowledge on the concepts.
Oct 18 19:52:13 <GermainZ>	zaeph: wanna laugh? https://0x0.st/iDu_.png
Oct 18 19:52:17 <zaeph>	It's one thing to hack something together with code you know and in a language that's hardly meant for optimisation (Elisp).  It's another to write a background process that would support threads and parallelisation.
Oct 18 19:52:59 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Wait *what*?
Oct 18 19:53:20 <zaeph>	The dude should have stayed a manager.
Oct 18 19:53:23 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 18 19:53:48 <GermainZ>	zaeph: well actually
Oct 18 19:53:53 <GermainZ>	I misread him hah
Oct 18 19:53:59 <GermainZ>	He's saying french isn't consistent. That's true
Oct 18 19:54:08 <GermainZ>	I don't know about comparing it to English tho, but maybe
Oct 18 19:54:10 <zaeph>	But less so than ENglish?
Oct 18 19:54:42 <GermainZ>	zaeph: mhm, perhaps
Oct 18 19:54:46 <zaeph>	I mean, it's an established fact that the link between graphemes and phonemes in English is horrendous, especially for French learners.
Oct 18 19:54:52 <GermainZ>	zaeph: both are extremely inconsistent IMO
Oct 18 19:55:01 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you're a native French speaker so highly biased tho
Oct 18 19:55:24 <zaeph>	Most definitely, yeah, but I did work on French as a general linguist, so I've put some distance with it.
Oct 18 19:55:42 <zaeph>	Double consonants in French are completely random.
Oct 18 19:56:02 <zaeph>	…English is more consistent in that regard.  But re: vowels, English's a mess.
Oct 18 19:56:29 <GermainZ>	zaeph: same with things like eau(x)/o/ô/au/aud/aus/etc
Oct 18 19:56:58 <GermainZ>	zaeph: the ambitiousness of silent letters in French definitely adds quite a lot of inconsistency that isn't there in English
Oct 18 19:56:59 <zaeph>	Not really, since they're all producing the same sound.  They're 'consistent' insofar as they always produce /o/.
Oct 18 19:57:14 <zaeph>	But 'ou' in English can have 4-5 different pronunciations.
Oct 18 19:57:19 <GermainZ>	zaeph: the inconsistency is specifically about the spelling vs pronunciation, isn't it?
Oct 18 19:57:52 <zaeph>	I took it more to mean 'a given grapheme can have multiple ways to be pronounced' rather than 'multiple graphemes can be mapped to a single phoneme'.
Oct 18 19:58:04 <GermainZ>	Ah
Oct 18 19:58:09 <GermainZ>	Perhaps so then
Oct 18 19:58:21 <zaeph>	In the former case, there's an element of unknown which can't be garnered from context.  In the latter case, it's consistent, just a PITA to learn.
Oct 18 19:59:12 <GermainZ>	zaeph: same with some things like ll in French, tho it might certainly be rarer
Oct 18 19:59:16 <zaeph>	(And by 'garnered from context', I mean what is immediately available to native speakers, i.e., not delving into etymology or nerdy stuff.)
Oct 18 19:59:46 <zaeph>	I'm pretty sure there have been studies on the topic, but it's typically the type of indicator that feels useless to define for a language.
Oct 18 20:00:15 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 18 20:00:20 <GermainZ>	Sure, it's just fun
Oct 18 20:00:50 <zaeph>	Lack of consistency between graphemes and phonemes are usually the results of reforms, and those can be so prompted by anything, but that doesn't make them replicate organic evolution.
Oct 18 20:01:31 <zaeph>	I'd love it if we could reform those sodding double consonants. -.-
Oct 18 20:01:46 <zaeph>	Seriously, think of all the unnecessary bullshit that you have to remember just because of that.
Oct 18 20:02:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: the Académie already gets enough flack, imagine if they tried that. They'd all get guillotined
Oct 18 20:02:24 <zaeph>	See, I'm not sure if they would.
Oct 18 20:02:29 <GermainZ>	Mhm, I now realize it's a bit in bad taste given the recent incident. I didn't think of that
Oct 18 20:03:21 <zaeph>	It's one thing to spell 'nenuphar' (= lily pad) as 'nenufar', it's another to consider 'developement' and 'developpement' equivalent.
Oct 18 20:03:40 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I hadn't even thought of it, don't worry.
Oct 18 20:04:06 <GermainZ>	<3
Oct 18 20:04:08 <zaeph>	But all the news here insisting on using 'beheaded' rather than 'assassinated' makes me gag a little.
Oct 18 20:04:45 <GermainZ>	zaeph: there is a slight different in pronunciation between the two, isn't there? Double consonants put slightly more emphasis on it 
Oct 18 20:04:58 <zaeph>	The vast majority of folks use it because they haven't seen the picture that was posted on Twitter, but as someone who did, it makes me super uncomfortable.
Oct 18 20:05:25 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I haven't seen the picture. What do you mean?
Oct 18 20:05:40 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Not necessarily.  See, Italian is very consistent with its double consonants, and it does what you've just described.  In French, a lot of them are just random.
Oct 18 20:06:17 <zaeph>	Knowing Latin helps, but it severely undermines your ability to be fun at parties when you do.
Oct 18 20:06:32 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 18 20:07:10 <GermainZ>	zaeph: intuitively, I would pronounce the "p" as "dé-vé-lop-men", the "pp" as "dé-vé-lo-pe-men"
Oct 18 20:08:40 <zaeph>	See, that's an interesting behaviour because it's actually not reflected in the language.  It's like asking Anglophones whether they pronounce the 'l' in 'salmon', and a lot of them will tell you that they do.  However, it's absolutely not reflected in their usage, and it's purely subconscious.
Oct 18 20:09:05 <zaeph>	Same thing happens with double consonants in French: when you see them in something that is not quite right, you try to persuade yourself that they're different.
Oct 18 20:09:59 <zaeph>	…But those conceptions are really challenged when you know both French and English.  'aggressive' in English has to 'g' because, otherwise, you'd be able to pronounce it as 'ay-gresive'.
Oct 18 20:10:16 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 18 20:10:20 <zaeph>	…But French has 'agressif'.
Oct 18 20:10:40 <__monty__>	Clearly the reason english sucks is french.
Oct 18 20:10:54 <zaeph>	Oh most definitely.
Oct 18 20:12:31 <zaeph>	Also, that vowel-shift-when-double-consonants in English isn't even consistant.
Oct 18 20:12:41 <zaeph>	You say 'literature', not 'lie-terature'.
Oct 18 20:12:52 <zaeph>	Yet, in French, we had to go ahead and write it 'littérature'.
Oct 18 20:13:25 <GermainZ>	Yeah
Oct 18 20:13:44 <zaeph>	(And, specifically, it's not 'lie' at the start, despite being stressed, exactly because it's a loan-word, and wanted to replicate the French way of saying it.)
Oct 18 20:14:23 <__monty__>	Hmm, we have vowel-shift but it doesn't apply when the next vowel's a soft(?) e.
Oct 18 20:14:25 <zaeph>	Like, they had to go out of their way to remove the double-t which is in the Latin 'litteratura'.
Oct 18 20:15:20 <__monty__>	Though in this particular word in dutch the e isn't actually soft.
Oct 18 20:15:28 <zaeph>	__monty__: In 'literature', you don't even have an 'e'-sound: it gets elided with the 'r', which acts as an approximant link with the next-schwa (i.e. the 'soft e' you mentioned).
Oct 18 20:15:50 <__monty__>	Anyway, vowel shift has a bunch of exceptions when the vowel's followed by an e.
Oct 18 20:16:21 <zaeph>	A'ight, that's enough phonology for tonight. :p
Oct 18 20:16:54 <__monty__>	zaeph: Hmm, not sure I agree completely. Sure, some say litrature, but lit-eh-rature is definitely common afaict.
Oct 18 20:17:10 <__monty__>	No stress on the eh but it's definitely there.
Oct 18 20:17:20 <zaeph>	__monty__: Oxford doesn't agree with you: `BrE /ˈlɪtrətʃə(r)/    ; NAmE /ˈlɪtrətʃər/    , also /ˈlɪtrətʃʊr/ `
Oct 18 20:17:33 <GermainZ>	That's how I'd pronounce it and hear it pronounced tho
Oct 18 20:17:38 <GermainZ>	litérature, not litrature
Oct 18 20:17:41 <__monty__>	Oxford's a bunch of twats.
Oct 18 20:17:49 <zaeph>	True, but that doesn't make them wrong. :p 
Oct 18 20:18:19 <__monty__>	No, observing the actual pronunciation among english speakers in the wild is what proves them wrong.
Oct 18 20:18:38 <GermainZ>	Wait, English?
Oct 18 20:18:44 <GermainZ>	I thought we were speaking about French
Oct 18 20:18:52 <zaeph>	Nah, 'literature' in English, GermainZ.
Oct 18 20:18:57 <GermainZ>	:D
Oct 18 20:19:04 <zaeph>	In French, definitely a é there.
Oct 18 20:19:18 <GermainZ>	Right, but I figured you were discussing the pronunciation when you said litrature vs lit-eh-rature
Oct 18 20:19:23 <GermainZ>	That sounded quite French to me
Oct 18 20:19:51 <__monty__>	Nah, the eh sounds like uh or even ah.
Oct 18 20:20:09 <__monty__>	It's hardly there but it's definitely there.
Oct 18 20:20:14 <zaeph>	__monty__: It's definitely not a shwa, there.  The tongue makes a glide which looks like a vowel, but it's the 'r' sound, which is an approximant, i.e., a consonantic sound that is close to a vowel in its voicing, but which still plays the rôle of a consonant in the syllable.
Oct 18 20:20:44 <GermainZ>	"litrashur" I guess for me
Oct 18 20:20:55 <zaeph>	…But honestly, in the past, we use to transcribe it with a superscript (ə) to show that there was a vowel-like sound there.
Oct 18 20:20:59 <GermainZ>	or chur
Oct 18 20:21:11 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Definitely 'chur'.
Oct 18 20:21:12 <GermainZ>	litratchur?
Oct 18 20:21:24 <zaeph>	GermainZ: 'ch' is enough to get the 't' in there.
Oct 18 20:21:25 <GermainZ>	there's a "t" sound in there
Oct 18 20:21:29 <GermainZ>	Ah, makes sense
Oct 18 20:21:53 <zaeph>	I think there are some exceptions in English where 'ch' doesn't have a 't' in it and isn't like 'loch', but I can't remember them.
Oct 18 20:22:15 <zaeph>	Well, I guess there's Rorschach, but it's kinda like 'loch'.
Oct 18 20:22:38 <zaeph>	(Not counting 'school' either, since the onset has another consonant before it.)
Oct 18 20:23:00 <GermainZ>	Yeah
Oct 18 20:23:10 <zaeph>	You guys'd better stop stirring the pot before you get me signed up in a speech synthesis lab.
Oct 18 20:23:25 <zaeph>	You guys'd better stop stirring the pot before you get me signed up in a speech synthesis lab.
Oct 18 20:23:31 <zaeph>	Dang it.
Oct 18 20:23:39 <zaeph>	Honestly, with my linguistic baggage, NLP and speech synthesis might be right up my alley.*
Oct 18 20:27:20 <zaeph>	To come back to 'surveying the field', books for interviews might help, but wouldn't you think that SICP or Composing Programs would be better approach based on my interests?
Oct 18 20:28:36 <GermainZ>	I don't know to be honest. I'd say just go with your gut feeling and get started with one, you can always switch later if you find that makes sense
Oct 18 20:29:03 <zaeph>	Alright, then.  I'll stick with APUE and SICP.
Oct 18 20:29:21 <zaeph>	…Unless one of you can convince me to prioritise Python.
Oct 18 20:29:37 <__monty__>	Think of all the contributions you could make to ranger!
Oct 18 20:29:50 <zaeph>	__monty__: You're gonna have to do better than this, chief.
Oct 18 20:29:54 <__monty__>	And don't you feel obligated just to ensure my sanity?
Oct 18 20:30:03 <zaeph>	A bit, frankly.
Oct 18 20:31:06 <zaeph>	I could do both SICP and CP to get both the real stuff and the Python stuff.  I don't think there'd be too much interference, considering I already know my way around lispy stuff.

Oct 18 21:43:38 <FichteFoll>	from a plugin, that is
Oct 18 21:44:36 <__monty__>	Maybe there's a hook or a signal on exit?

Oct 19 10:34:42 <GermainZ>	A quick google suggests "not yet"
Oct 19 10:37:06 <eyJhb>	GermainZ: home-manager - https://rycee.gitlab.io/home-manager/options.html#opt-programs.fish.plugins
Oct 19 10:37:16 <eyJhb>	Could easily create your own list of plugins
Oct 19 10:42:16 <GermainZ>	Thanks
Oct 19 10:44:25 <zaeph>	Oh, that remains me: I could go back to play with NixOS now that I've got more time and less mission-critical stuff to do.
Oct 19 10:45:33 <zaeph>	s/remains/reminds/
Oct 19 11:28:56 <vifon>	GermainZ: What "plugins"?
Oct 19 11:30:01 <GermainZ>	vifon: fish plugins
Oct 19 11:30:14 <GermainZ>	e.g. bobthefish
Oct 19 11:31:16 <vifon>	It seems I'm out of the loop.  I never got these shell plugins…
Oct 19 11:31:50 <GermainZ>	vifon: bobthefish is just a powerline-like prompt. I had a custom prompt written in zsh, but fish's is so fast I didn't bother
Oct 19 11:32:02 <GermainZ>	You definitely don't need plugins
Oct 19 11:34:02 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)
Oct 19 11:34:34 <vifon>	*You* definitely don't need plugins?
Oct 19 11:34:37 <vifon>	You *definitely* don't need plugins?
Oct 19 11:34:39 <vifon>	You definitely *don't* need plugins?
Oct 19 11:34:41 <vifon>	You definitely don't *need* plugins?
Oct 19 11:34:43 <vifon>	You definitely don't need *plugins*?
Oct 19 11:34:45 <vifon>	Which one is it, GermainZ?
Oct 19 11:35:08 <GermainZ>	vifon: *need*
Oct 19 11:35:09 <eyJhb>	GermainZ: But it is quite easy to get to work, so it is fine! But most things that are just a repo in a place are

Oct 20 11:07:45 <grobi>	what is the best way to find and reduce duplicate or triple files?
Oct 20 11:25:28 <vifon>	grobi: I think there is a filter for that.
Oct 20 11:25:36 <vifon>	Press "." to see the filters.
Oct 20 13:02:09 <grobi>	vifon: ah, thanks
Oct 20 13:05:12 <grobi>	vifon: there is: '"' for 'filter_stack add duplicate' ..
Oct 20 13:05:38 <vifon>	Indeed.
Oct 20 13:06:00 <grobi>	what will it do?
Oct 20 13:07:23 <grobi>	and can i use it for folders (directories) as well?
Oct 20 13:07:42 <vifon>	I don't think so.
Oct 20 13:07:54 <vifon>	I presume it'll show you only the files that repeat.
Oct 20 13:08:57 <grobi>	and it rompts: 'Unicode-objects must be encoded before hashing'
Oct 20 13:09:05 <grobi>	*prompts
Oct 20 13:15:55 <vifon>	Well, looks like a bug then!
Oct 20 13:16:00 <vifon>	Try running ranger in Python 3.
Oct 20 13:33:13 <grobi>	? how to
Oct 20 13:35:03 <vifon>	"python3 $(which ranger)"
Oct 20 13:35:07 <vifon>	Drop $ if you're on fish.
Oct 20 13:38:28 <grobi>	$
Oct 20 14:15:22 <__monty__>	Gdi
Oct 20 14:15:43 <__monty__>	Isn't it py3 that requires encoding?
Oct 20 14:20:05 <__monty__>	Yeah, not encoding a filepath.
Oct 20 14:20:24 <__monty__>	And now I realize that it only considers directories duplicates if they have the exact same path.
Oct 20 14:26:38 <__monty__>	I wonder if resolving to an absolute path would be better?
Oct 20 14:26:47 <__monty__>	Or maybe inode?
Oct 20 14:27:02 <__monty__>	Bind mounts make this a hard problem.
Oct 20 14:27:17 <vifon>	__monty__: Can directories even be duplicates?
Oct 20 14:27:40 <__monty__>	symlinks?
Oct 20 14:27:55 <__monty__>	But files are duplicates when the *contents* is the same.
Oct 20 14:28:01 <__monty__>	So I don't see why directories can't?
Oct 20 14:28:04 <vifon>	I wouldn't consider a symlink a duplicate.
Oct 20 14:28:21 <vifon>	For the same reason we don't calculate the directory sizes.
Oct 20 14:28:22 <__monty__>	Like, copy a directory tree over but append x to every name.
Oct 20 14:28:25 <__monty__>	Boom, duplicate.
Oct 20 14:28:36 <vifon>	What?

Oct 20 15:01:24 <__monty__>	Sure, the gradualness is cool. But any amount of type hints makes it py2 incompatible. So we might as well make it py3 incompatible at the same time : >
Oct 20 15:01:59 <vifon>	So, operation ranger 2.0?
Oct 20 15:02:17 <vifon>	Quickly, let's do it while tr1pw1r3[m] is busy.
Oct 20 15:07:04 <__monty__>	Didn't say I had any round tuits.
Oct 20 15:07:42 <__monty__>	I'm basically saying to really solve the problem would be so much work that status quo isn't that bad.

Nov 07 20:11:51 <vifon>	Shots fired!
Nov 07 20:12:04 <zaeph>	Saw that yesterday.
Nov 07 20:12:28 <zaeph>	Oh wow, hadn't seen the first comment.
Nov 07 20:13:05 <vifon>	I'm sending a strike team, GermainZ ready?

Nov 07 20:14:18 <vifon>	I wanted GermainZ to krav maga the shit out of the author.
Nov 07 20:14:56 <zaeph>	Great, now I don't even have plausible deniability.
Nov 07 22:08:11 <zaeph>	You know what: it might be because it's been a while, but I've thoroughly enjoyed catching up on the maint for org-roam.
Nov 07 22:11:43 <vifon>	That's great to hear, zaeph!
Nov 07 22:12:17 <zaeph>	I was worried that it'd be hard to catch-up, but keeping a clean repo actually helps a ton in catching up on issue.
Nov 07 22:12:46 <zaeph>	Just the fact that I could magit-blame on the repo, check the commit, go to the PR, and check the linked issues, I feel like I understand most of the changes.
Nov 07 22:12:51 <__monty__>	Better to get over the urge of going to zero issues quicker rather than later.
Nov 07 22:12:56 <__monty__>	It's a recipe for burnout.
Nov 07 22:13:14 <__monty__>	Well, burnout or being coarse.
Nov 07 22:13:36 <zaeph>	Arguably, we were in a maintain-only phase, which alleviates the amount of stuff to catch up on, but it was still nice.
Nov 07 22:14:23 <zaeph>	__monty__: About 1/3 of our issues are long-running, and we use them to track design implementations which should make their way into core in the future.
Nov 07 22:15:03 <zaeph>	So, by doing this, we've given up on zero-issues, I believe.
Nov 08 00:22:57 <zaeph>	Good night~!

Jan 27 19:51:54 <blawiz>	anyone tried to make linux from scratch? how much work is it?
Jan 27 20:02:48 <GermainZ>	blawiz: I think it took Linus a year or so to get his initial version
Jan 27 20:22:40 <eyJhb>	MORNING!
Jan 27 20:23:04 <eyJhb>	__monty__: Same
Jan 27 21:15:32 <blawiz>	do you use noatime in fstab?
Jan 27 21:16:06 <blawiz>	arch wiki says it will be trouble for mutt, i dont understand why exactly

Jan 27 21:22:02 <__monty__>	Mutt probably uses it to figure out whether an email has been read or not?
Jan 27 21:24:39 <blawiz>	hmm would think it could keep track of that when i open a message
Jan 27 21:25:18 <mord0d[x230]>	__monty__, for mbox maybe (default format for local mail). In Maildir format there is "flags" in filenames.
Jan 27 21:25:45 <blawiz>	ah, maybe its outdated
Jan 27 21:26:14 <blawiz>	a guy in #mutt (who says its an unqualified answer) says he has noatime set and has no trouble
Jan 27 21:27:06 <mord0d[x230]>	If you don't use one-file format (mbox) or format without "flags" (mdir), you probably can ignore this recommendation about 'noatime'.

Feb 01 09:45:38 <zaeph>	Luyin: Are you feeling better?
Feb 01 09:49:42 <Luyin>	zaeph: yes, a lot, thank you! :)

Feb 01 09:54:49 <zaeph>	#firstworldproblem
Feb 01 09:56:59 <Luyin>	question to you python experts: I've got a package here, called foo, in which I have a utils/utils.py, and I want to import this in foo/preprocessing/make_questions.py. Tree structure: https://paste.xinu.at/BoexJo/ Now how do I import utils in make_questions? I got "from . import utils" in utils/__init__py.
Feb 01 09:57:28 <zaeph>	…But in other news, my suitor is most likely coming to my place tomorrow; who knows all kind of fancy things might happen.
Feb 01 09:58:18 <zaeph>	Luyin: That's beyong my non-expertise, sorry.
Feb 01 09:59:16 <Luyin>	zaeph: nice! fingers crossed for whatever you wish to happen :)
Feb 01 09:59:29 <Luyin>	zaeph: no prob, I'll wait for vifon or __m<tab>
Feb 01 09:59:38 <Luyin>	where's the git now
Feb 01 10:00:34 <zaeph>	Luyin: I'm not exactly sure what I'm wishing to happen.  It's hard to gauge those things when you're recovering from a long-relationship; especially when the persons have significant overlaps in theirtraits.
Feb 01 10:01:13 <zaeph>	Luyin: monty's been pulling a vifon by going to bed to increasingly later times; we might not see him until he's down a complete revolution around the clock.

Feb 01 10:03:18 <Luyin>	also hi.

Feb 01 10:05:11 <zaeph>	Luyin: I've been 'keep[ing] an about mind about things' since September, and the person has let surprisingly little on about the whole affair.  I did confess for a mild interest back in late September, which they shrugged off in an off-handed fashion, but has since been getting closer and closer to me.  Hell, for the first time in months, they finally dropped the hint that they'd been with men
Feb 01 10:05:13 <zaeph>	before. 🤔
Feb 01 10:08:44 <Luyin>	eyJhb: TOC? table of contents? if so how is it new?

Feb 01 10:10:45 <eyJhb>	Luyin: It is just annoying "new" but rather old :p People who don't do their slides in fullscreen
Feb 01 10:11:01 <Luyin>	eyJhb: ah lol
Feb 01 10:11:09 <Luyin>	thought you were giving a presentation
Feb 01 10:11:13 <Luyin>	as in preparing
Feb 01 10:12:57 <eyJhb>	Ohh no, this is our semester coordinator giving us an introduction to the semester :p But he is cool/nice, so we will survive
Feb 01 10:13:49 <eyJhb>	Weird thing is, it is my dads old colleagues from his previous work :p 
Feb 01 10:13:55 <eyJhb>	*Denmark is small*
Feb 01 10:14:16 <Luyin>	hehe
Feb 01 10:18:04 <zaeph>	Luyin: The crux of the matter is that I'm not sure why I'm guarded about it.  With my previous relationship, I was doting over the person from the get go, enough to see through the thick curtains of his closet; but here, because I've been hurt, I'm not sure if I'm *preventing* myself from feeling attracted, or if there is less attraction at the start.
Feb 01 10:23:06 <Luyin>	zaeph: would you like advice or rather I just listen? :)
Feb 01 10:23:48 <zaeph>	Luyin: Advice are welcome.  I've been discussing it with other people, so it's not a confidence nor something that needs dire airing out.
Feb 01 10:23:58 <Luyin>	ok :)
Feb 01 10:24:13 <zaeph>	(is* welcome, even.)
Feb 01 10:25:38 <Luyin>	I mean I don't have the perfect solution obviously, but something that has helped me navigating my relationships is an overview of my needs, desires, and boundaries. I've compiled it into a "user manual" to myself which I can pass on to prospective new people, whether they're supposed to become partners, friends or whatever else (it does not really work for colleagues I think :D ). Maybe writing
Feb 01 10:25:38 <vifon>	Luyin: Either use the absolute path (import utils.utils) or relative (from ..utils import utils).
Feb 01 10:25:39 <Luyin>	some of these points down for yourself can help you get a clearer picture, or it might reveal what's missing/not quite adding up here?
Feb 01 10:25:46 <vifon>	Hopefully I didn't screw up the latter.
Feb 01 10:26:07 <Luyin>	vifon: I shouldn't need the repetition with the __init__.py entry though, should I?
Feb 01 10:26:20 <vifon>	What repetition?
Feb 01 10:26:26 <vifon>	Ah.
Feb 01 10:26:32 <vifon>	It depends.  What does it contain?
Feb 01 10:27:15 <Luyin>	"from . import utils"
Feb 01 10:27:29 <vifon>	Hm… I'm not convinced.
Feb 01 10:27:35 <Luyin>	so if you import utils (which would refer to the directory) then you'd automatically import utils.py I think
Feb 01 10:27:41 <Luyin>	hmm and I'm unsure :D
Feb 01 10:27:44 <zaeph>	Luyin: Huh, interesting.  I tend to do that step *after* knowing that we're compatible so as to 'draft a contract', so to speak.  I don't have any problem taking a bird's eye view of the situation and explaining what I'm looking for; but doing so preemptively for myself might be fruitful.  I'll try that; thanks!
Feb 01 10:27:52 <Luyin>	I'll try it out, and hope to remember updating you on it, vifon. thx :)
Feb 01 10:27:52 <vifon>	from .utils import *
Feb 01 10:27:55 <vifon>	This would work.
Feb 01 10:27:59 <vifon>	In __init__.py
Feb 01 10:28:04 <Luyin>	zaeph: good luck! :)
Feb 01 10:32:46 <zaeph>	Luyin: Thanks!  I guess there's also the fear of losing the friendship that I have with them, or the fact that we might both be jumping abroad next year.  LDR sucks when you're doting over someone.
Feb 01 10:38:42 <vifon>	zaeph: Or even if things won't go like you'd like them to, you can act like adults and just continue being friends.
Feb 01 10:39:18 <zaeph>	vifon: True; but it's a risk that wouldn't be taken if I we were to stay like this.
Feb 01 11:45:57 <zaeph>	…I declare email bankruptcy.
Feb 01 11:46:42 <__monty__>	Toomuch email? I thought you were using notmuch?
Feb 01 11:47:35 <zaeph>	__monty__: I am, but I've been blocked ever since Christmas.
Feb 01 11:47:42 <zaeph>	This is the current state: https://paste.xinu.at/6J69/
Feb 01 11:47:58 <zaeph>	I periodically fetch, but I've disabled my crons.
Feb 01 11:48:31 <zaeph>	…I think I'm just going to mark everything as 'read', keep them in my inbox, and process them in chunks.
Feb 01 11:49:19 <__monty__>	I would never get around to them that way.
Feb 01 11:49:25 <vifon>	zaeph: Wouldn't the opposite make more sense?
Feb 01 11:49:30 <vifon>	Or even use some other tag.
Feb 01 11:49:34 <vifon>	Leave inbox alone.
Feb 01 11:49:39 <__monty__>	I basically have an inbox like that which I haven't dared look at since 2018.
Feb 01 11:49:59 <zaeph>	I'd welcome your input; I really don't know how to go about it right now.
Feb 01 11:50:07 <zaeph>	…I just don't want to miss important emails from contractors.
Feb 01 11:50:20 <__monty__>	Looks to me like you should decrease the sources of emails.
Feb 01 11:50:30 <__monty__>	Turn down the number of notifications github emails you about.
Feb 01 11:50:41 <vifon>	notmuch tag -inbox +oldinbox -- tag:inbox
Feb 01 11:50:44 <vifon>	zaeph: ↑
Feb 01 11:50:55 <zaeph>	I already have a switch for automatic notifications like GitHub, Discourse, and other stuff like this.
Feb 01 11:51:32 <__monty__>	Don't tell me you have 3k+ emails all composed for you personally.
Feb 01 11:51:35 <zaeph>	Okay, you know what; you two are making me all so fuzzy inside with the advice that I'm just going to tackle the whole stack.
Feb 01 11:51:44 <__monty__>	There must be a ton of stuff in there you don't actually have to look at.
Feb 01 11:51:49 <zaeph>	__monty__: No, but I'm into a ton of mailing lists for French floss. -.-
Feb 01 11:52:13 <zaeph>	If I don't report back in 15', please ping me.
Feb 01 11:52:17 <Luyin>	:D
Feb 01 11:52:35 <__monty__>	"Being on" a mailing list means you're managing to keep track of topics. Which, it doesn't look like you're "on" any mailing lists : p
Feb 01 11:52:51 <vifon>	Oof.
Feb 01 11:53:18 <__monty__>	So you might as well drop most of them so you can actually keep track of some.
Feb 01 11:53:31 <zaeph>	I should have phrased it as: 'I'm subscribed to those mailing lists because of a job, but I haven't kept track of them since December.'
Feb 01 11:53:41 <zaeph>	I think I need to be more on top of things with my notmuch filters.
Feb 01 11:54:18 <vifon>	__monty__: FYI, I've unsubscribed from the email notifications from ranger apart from the ones that mention me.  For the exact reason you mentioned.  I'd rather not miss these and I was already buried under the rest.
Feb 01 11:54:36 <zaeph>	I need to come up with more categories, I think: https://paste.xinu.at/EBQ/
Feb 01 11:54:38 <__monty__>	Yeah, understandable, and pretty much my point.
Feb 01 11:54:57 <__monty__>	It's no use being subscribed to a mailing list unless you can at least keep track of all the topics.
Feb 01 11:56:04 <__monty__>	Like, unless you know you'll search the archive regularly. Or you want to mirror something, like some people do for nixpkgs PRs (and it has helped recover stuff since github can delete users completely whenever but not from your inbox).
Feb 01 11:56:25 <vifon>	Heh.
Feb 01 11:56:41 <zaeph>	It's why I've subscribed to emacs-devel, but it goes straight to archive.
Feb 01 11:56:43 <Luyin>	zaeph: I follow a lot of MLs too. I automatically sort them into dirs and only look at the dirs at all occasionally. Plus, I never look in my inbox; I have a tagging system where I get all "unlabelled" mail in a "TODO" folder, then I either move them to respective other folders, or mark them as one of "Archive", "Action Required", "Wait". I got the idea from something like this:
Feb 01 11:56:45 <Luyin>	https://www.flippingheck.com/getting-things-done-with-thunderbird/
Feb 01 11:57:05 <__monty__>	There's like 3 or 4 mailing lists I'd *like* to subscribe to. But I'm realistic in that I'm not gonna commit to one unless I can keep track.
Feb 01 11:57:27 <zaeph>	I've been on top of things with org-mode's ML from October to December, which was nice.
Feb 01 12:00:34 <__monty__>	A rule to rewrite those horrible "via Org-roam, ... via Org-roam, ... via Org-roam" subjects would go a long way towards being able to skim through topics to decide whether or not they're important imo.
Feb 01 12:01:18 <vifon>	I was about to say it'd break GPG signing but I don't think the subject is signed.
Feb 01 12:01:40 <vifon>	On the other hand, one of my past clients used to rewrite every link…
Feb 01 12:01:41 <zaeph>	I think I'm having trouble negotiating the transition to a multi-faceted life in FLOSS.  When it was just org-mode and me, I could manage.  Now that I'm fighting on many fronts, trying to keep trick of everything as diligently as I used to is becoming taxing.
Feb 01 12:02:31 <__monty__>	Why do you think I keep on top of ranger issues?
Feb 01 12:02:49 <__monty__>	If I didn't for a week and there was a sudden influx I'd be immediately swamped.
Feb 01 12:02:56 <__monty__>	There's no coming back from that.
Feb 01 12:03:04 <vifon>	Indeed.
Feb 01 12:03:17 <__monty__>	So simply don't add enough sources to bring you to that point.
Feb 01 12:03:39 <__monty__>	IRC is plenty to keep up with for me.
Feb 01 12:03:39 <zaeph>	I think it's my first real time in my life being 'swamped'.
Feb 01 12:03:43 <zaeph>	In emails, I mean.
Feb 01 12:03:59 <zaeph>	Hell: I haven't had my cron jobs on from mid-December to now.
Feb 01 12:04:04 <__monty__>	Wow, stop flaunting your privilege.
Feb 01 12:04:42 <__monty__>	vifon: I didn't really mean "rewrite the email" as much as "make your client display something useful rather than this gibberish."
Feb 01 12:04:44 <zaeph>	Heh.  I'd rather have not done so, though, considering how much anxiety this has induced.
Feb 01 12:04:56 <__monty__>	Let go of the FOMO.
Feb 01 12:05:03 <__monty__>	This should be your mantra for today.
Feb 01 12:05:21 <zaeph>	Luyin: Thanks for the advice.  I think I should have a better workflow for my emails.  I have the perfect org-mode setup to handle that; but I'd probably need some extra notmuch filters.
Feb 01 12:12:28 <zaeph>	I'm down to mid-January.  I think I'll be able to make it.
Feb 01 12:12:40 <zaeph>	So far, 90% was utterly useless. -.-
Feb 01 12:19:30 <vifon>	Let go of the FOMO, MOFO!
Feb 01 12:19:49 <zaeph>	Suprise, FOMOfucker.
Feb 01 12:20:15 <vifon>	Oh, so I'm not the only one surprised "surprise" contains a second "r".
Feb 01 12:21:40 <zaeph>	vifon: My hands are cold; I've turned off the heater last week.
Feb 01 12:22:16 <zaeph>	The weird thing is that I don't feel that cold, and yes, I've lost some weight and must have fewer layers of insulation. 🤔
Feb 01 12:22:48 <__monty__>	Cold hands are the worst.
Feb 01 12:23:01 <__monty__>	I wouldn't even turn on the space heater if my hands weren't cold.
Feb 01 12:23:08 <__monty__>	Thin gloves didn't work out.
Feb 01 12:23:09 <zaeph>	__monty__: You use gloves for that, right?  I think I'm remembering.
Feb 01 12:23:22 <__monty__>	Have considered getting fingerless gloves.
Feb 01 12:23:37 <zaeph>	I did try that, but I don't remember liking the experience typing on the keyboard.
Feb 01 12:23:45 <zaeph>	The wrists are very slippery.
Feb 01 12:24:04 <zaeph>	Cycling gloves might work best.
Feb 01 12:24:14 <__monty__>	Yeah it's more of a problem management technique, not a luxury : )
Feb 01 12:25:07 <__monty__>	Maybe one of those victorian lady hand sleeve things but with the keyboard in there.
Feb 01 12:26:07 <zaeph>	I doubt laces are very good for heat retention, though. :p
Feb 01 12:26:26 <__monty__>	This is a good time to weed out the mailing lists btw. If there weren't any interesting mails for 3 months you shouldn't stay subscribed.
Feb 01 12:26:40 <zaeph>	…I did it!  Down to 42 emails that I'll be addressing throughout the day.  That's a glorious trim.
Feb 01 12:26:41 <__monty__>	Laces?
Feb 01 12:27:19 <zaeph>	__monty__: Can you get me a picture of what you're talking about?  I was imagining those long lacy/embroidered sleeves which only go to mid-palm.
Feb 01 12:29:41 <__monty__>	https://s2.qwant.com/thumbr/0x0/f/6/5e34094f39abafee87a131bd0ad17ec1ac75d6e228fffa8a4234183e758fc1/s-l300.jpg?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ebayimg.com%2Fimages%2Fg%2FH9gAAOSw5dlaOpRG%2Fs-l300.jpg&q=0&b=1&p=0&a=1
Feb 01 12:30:06 <zaeph>	Oh that's *nice*.
Feb 01 12:30:37 <__monty__>	I'd imagine more of a kangaroo pouch though, open along the bottom of the keyboard?
Feb 01 12:31:23 <zaeph>	Should I book you for Shark Tank?
Feb 01 12:33:33 <__monty__>	Nah, I'll just go around asking ladies whether they want to see my hands up a muff.
Feb 01 12:33:43 <__monty__>	I'm sure word of mouth will spread rapidly.
Feb 01 12:34:06 <zaeph>	That'd be terrible for Ranger™, too.
Feb 01 12:34:34 <__monty__>	Terrible? I think you mean "brilliant?"

Feb 01 12:36:45 <__monty__>	Site-specific behavior hardcoded in browsers? 😭
Feb 01 12:37:34 <__monty__>	If anything has enough weight to get these companies to fix their sites surely it'd be webkit?

Feb 01 14:20:15 <__monty__>	I think xdotool didn't help because it really emulates pressing the capslock key. And since you remapped that it didn't have the desired effect.

Feb 04 19:48:31 <birkoff>	GermainZ: why doesn't the manual state that no '-' is requried before the flag with 'open_with'
Feb 04 19:49:03 <birkoff>	with :shell a '-' is required
Feb 04 19:50:03 <GermainZ>	birkoff: it does in the examples, but PR welcome I guess
Feb 04 19:55:10 <birkoff>	what does this key mean here? 'They are used in the commands ":open_with" (key "r") and ":shell" (key "!").'
Feb 04 19:56:08 <GermainZ>	birkoff: "r" and "!" are the keyboard shortcuts for :open_with and :shell, respectively
Feb 04 19:56:32 <birkoff>	oh
Feb 04 20:02:00 <birkoff>	wouldn't it be better to change the :open_with command to use - prefixed flags ? O_o

Feb 07 16:07:09 <vifon>	Ironic.  I don't trust them to handle no-JS issues properly but I (need to) trust them with my money.
Feb 07 16:07:17 <GermainZ>	:D
Feb 07 16:08:20 <eyJhb>	Granted, some of them don't even work WITH js...........

Feb 07 16:08:39 <GermainZ>	heh
Feb 07 16:08:54 <vifon>	Took me a few seconds.

Feb 07 16:09:09 <eyJhb>	:D 
Feb 07 16:10:15 <vifon>	Random thought: Google could create some API so the websites would directly request your credentials from their password manager and you'd be forced to use Google for your password management.
Feb 07 16:10:25 <vifon>	I shouldn't give them any ideas though.

Feb 07 16:26:17 <zaeph>	I pay 22 EUR for 1 Gbps down / .5 Gbps up.
Feb 07 16:26:25 <zaeph>	Get to my level, scrubs.
Feb 07 16:26:36 <zaeph>	Also: I'm in the train, so don't expect me to be reading your retorts any time soon.
Feb 07 16:29:14 <eyJhb>	zaeph: IPv6 ready?
Feb 07 16:29:21 <__monty__>	Metropoles aren't a good representation of a country when it comes to internet access though.
Feb 07 16:29:31 <__monty__>	Can you get that outside Paris?
Feb 07 16:29:37 <GermainZ>	He's not in Paris, is he?
Feb 07 16:29:48 <__monty__>	Because, who'd wanna live in a big city?
Feb 07 16:30:19 <__monty__>	Probably some banlieu but "broader Paris."
Feb 07 16:45:23 <vifon>	zaeph: That's a nice speed for a train.
Feb 07 16:52:47 <__monty__>	Giga-butts transported per second?
Feb 07 17:04:24 <zaeph>	__monty__: I lived in another big city before, and it was pretty similar.  No optical fiber near my hometown, though.
Feb 07 17:04:36 <zaeph>	eyJhb: I think so, yeah.
Feb 07 17:06:25 <vifon>	I feel personally attacked.  https://lobste.rs/s/tcqizo/architecture_md#c_0ycxwt
Feb 07 17:06:30 <__monty__>	Like I said, large cities aren't a good point of reference. It's exactly the kind of thing that makes the democrats unpopular in most of the US.
Feb 07 17:06:51 <zaeph>	__monty__: I know; I wasn't going against you.
Feb 07 17:09:14 <__monty__>	You better not, that'd be harrassment of the sexual variety!
Feb 07 17:09:25 <GermainZ>	Just because he's gay? Smh
Feb 07 17:24:38 <zaeph>	Why does it always have to be about my being gay?  Can't I just be insufferable *in spite* of being gay?
Feb 07 17:35:54 <zaeph>	Holy *shit*.  This is what it feels like to be wearing a pair of shoes which are *actually* close to the shape of your feet.
Feb 07 17:36:37 <zaeph>	I spent a couple of hours at another shop today (higher quality that what I'd been first), and they have different last, which is how they call the different shapes off which the models are based.
Feb 07 17:37:43 <zaeph>	I found something that is actually pretty damn close to my own shape, and whilst the leather will need to be broken in (more than my previous model, based on the more advanced stitching), I have enough wiggle room with the lacing to accommodate the extra millimeters that I'm going to win.
Feb 07 17:37:55 <zaeph>	__monty__: Mostly for you ↑.
Feb 07 17:38:24 <GermainZ>	these kinds of shops open on Sundays? That's nice
Feb 07 17:38:52 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Yeah, they have to because of the curfew at 6pm.
Feb 07 17:39:02 <GermainZ>	how so?
Feb 07 17:39:08 <zaeph>	People who work until then hardly have the time for going shopping.
Feb 07 17:39:15 <GermainZ>	they usually open past 6pm on weekdays?
Feb 07 17:39:43 <zaeph>	Generally until 7pm-8pm; but it has a *massive* impact in how people can go check the stores.
Feb 07 17:39:52 <zaeph>	Because of the 6pm curfew, people get anxious at 4:30pm.
Feb 07 17:40:10 <GermainZ>	Ah I see
Feb 07 17:40:29 <GermainZ>	In Switzerland I'm used to both mostly closing at 6 anyway…
Feb 07 17:40:49 <GermainZ>	though I'm lucky, the little market next to me closes at 8 instead
Feb 07 17:41:00 <zaeph>	It's one thing for things to close at 6pm; it's another to be *back home* by 6pm.
Feb 07 17:41:10 <zaeph>	Especially when your employer does jack shit when it comes to adapting their closing times.
Feb 07 17:41:15 <GermainZ>	True, I didn't think about that
Feb 07 17:43:13 <zaeph>	The new babies: https://paste.xinu.at/ZSjQNZ/
Feb 07 17:43:34 <zaeph>	They're burgundy; the lighting isn't giving them justicew.
Feb 07 18:03:05 <__monty__>	zaeph: You should look at running shoes, like Altra's "Foot Shape" last (I guess?).
Feb 07 18:03:29 <__monty__>	I don't think leather shoes will ever actually accomodate feet well.
Feb 07 18:04:03 <zaeph>	__monty__: Well, I wanted to have leather shoes, so that much wasn't negotiable. :)
Feb 07 18:04:06 <__monty__>	It ruins the aesthetic.
Feb 07 18:04:50 <__monty__>	Reconsidered the boots?
Feb 07 18:05:23 <__monty__>	These ones have very minimal brogueing and they're not derbies either. How many shoes are you gonna be buying?
Feb 07 18:05:38 <zaeph>	Nope: I found and tried two models that will be amazing, but they weren't available in the colour I wanted.  I'll be buying the two pairs once I get paid.
Feb 07 18:06:34 <zaeph>	I'd planned on 4: 1 pair of Oxfords, 1 pair of Derbies, and 2 pair of boots (more or less rugged).  Eventually, I wanted to get a 2nd pair of Oxfords in burgundy, which I ended up buying now.
Feb 07 18:06:56 <zaeph>	…And I think I'm all set.  I might get some sneakers for the summers, but that's about it.
Feb 07 18:08:03 <eyJhb>	so.... Since no one else asked this
Feb 07 18:08:12 <zaeph>	I'm hoping to keep this collection for at least a couple of years, so we'll see!
Feb 07 18:08:14 <eyJhb>	Why the hell do you have so many USB things connected eyJhb ?
Feb 07 18:08:26 <zaeph>	eyJhb: Do you mean me?
Feb 07 18:08:56 <eyJhb>	zaeph: Yes! I don't know why I  asked myself
Feb 07 18:08:58 <eyJhb>	Sorry
Feb 07 18:09:49 <zaeph>	eyJhb: It's because I use my laptop as my main PC: https://paste.xinu.at/8X8gbM/
Feb 07 18:10:06 <zaeph>	…So, I have to keep it connected to webcam, mic, keeb, mouse, etc.
Feb 07 18:10:34 <eyJhb>	I see, but I raise you having.. Three. Mouse, keyboard and USB hub with nothing in it
Feb 07 18:10:34 <zaeph>	The hub is mostly there to have a convenient on/off switch for communication devices, but also to reset the keeb/mouse when they're misbehaving.
Feb 07 18:10:55 <eyJhb>	What is there besides the the web, mic, keeb, mouse?
Feb 07 18:11:00 <eyJhb>	microphone
Feb 07 18:11:20 <eyJhb>	Then there is one left, I count 6
Feb 07 18:11:33 <zaeph>	In order: webcam, mic, keeb, mouse, empty, empty, unconnected micro-USB, unconnected USB-C.
Feb 07 18:12:04 <eyJhb>	Fair, quite a clean setup. I cannot compare atm.
Feb 07 18:12:28 <zaeph>	I use another one of those hubs for managing my external drives on my server.  They're quite convenient, although they do cost 20 EUR.
Feb 07 18:12:50 <zaeph>	…But the first one I've bought has been holding on perfectly for 2.5y now.
Feb 07 18:13:41 <eyJhb>	zaeph: https://i.imgur.com/NxueSyd.jpg 
Feb 07 18:13:47 <eyJhb>	Ehmmm... USB 3.0 drives?
Feb 07 18:14:18 <zaeph>	…Also, I clearly wouldn't have bought any of this on a uni-student budget.  I've been lucky to have a paying job for a couple of years, which is the only way I could justify those spendings, along the standing-desk.
Feb 07 18:14:54 <zaeph>	Thank you for emptying that glass before taking the photo, you dweeb.
Feb 07 18:15:09 <eyJhb>	It has been standing there since this morning
Feb 07 18:15:17 <eyJhb>	:D
Feb 07 18:15:26 <zaeph>	eyJhb: Yup, USB-3.  They're for infrequent access and seeding, so I don't need them up 100%.
Feb 07 18:16:51 <zaeph>	I guess it's time for a 6-month review of the standing desk, btw: I'd say I use my desk standing 30% of my day (especially in the morning and during meetings), and it's really convenient to be able to have a 'table' (rather than a desk) that you can raise.  Peak laziness is raising the desk to blow on your soup more easily whilst watching something.

Feb 07 19:22:00 <blawiz>	does partitioning a hdd protect against corrupt/data loss?

Feb 07 19:26:36 <vifon>	What kind of data loss do you have in mind?
Feb 07 19:26:46 <vifon>	The physical failures don't care about partitions.
Feb 07 19:26:49 <vifon>	A bad rm -rf does.
Feb 07 19:27:02 <blawiz>	mhm, i guess its more physical
Feb 07 19:27:20 <blawiz>	a physical one is likely to destroy zero or all partitions?
Feb 07 19:27:34 <vifon>	Or some range of sectors.
Feb 07 19:27:54 <blawiz>	hmm
Feb 07 19:28:16 <vifon>	For physical failures you want RAID.
Feb 07 19:28:43 <vifon>	For bitrot you want something like ZFS.
Feb 07 19:29:04 <vifon>	For user being users you want backups.

Feb 07 19:32:21 <vifon>	Huh?
Feb 07 19:32:32 <__monty__>	It's probably the most reliable filesystem out there though.
Feb 07 19:32:47 <vifon>	I believe FreeBSD is totally fine with ZFS.
Feb 07 19:32:57 <vifon>	Shouldn't OpenBSD be too?
Feb 07 19:33:08 <__monty__>	Sure, but Linux isn't so maybe OpenBSD isn't either.

Feb 08 19:28:15 <zaeph>	'Sup fuckos.
Feb 08 19:28:47 <zaeph>	So: turns out both pairs of boots I wanted were back in stock today, so I grabbed the one pair that was physically there, and ordered the other one.
Feb 08 19:29:17 <zaeph>	Give or take two weeks, my collection will be complete.  Now I'm just hoping for another lockdown to get to break them all in inside or within 1km of my flat. :p
Feb 08 19:33:24 <__monty__>	When are you gonna model some of these shoes? Or are these to put on just before you walk into a conference room?
Feb 08 19:35:04 <zaeph>	__monty__: I wanted a rugged pair which had some nice waxy leather on it (pretty sturdy, and they age beautifully), and the one one with a more city vibe.  It's the second one that I have physically here, and they're nice dark brown brogues.
Feb 08 19:35:29 <zaeph>	Give me half an hour to unlace them and I'll take a pic. :p
Feb 08 19:36:44 <__monty__>	Wait, why does that take 30 min?
Feb 08 19:36:57 <zaeph>	Hyperbole.
Feb 08 19:38:31 <zaeph>	__monty__: I don't have the time to make the laces pretty, so here's what you get: https://paste.xinu.at/HOm/
Feb 08 19:39:03 <vifon>	I don't remember hiring you as a ranger mascot, cowboy!
Feb 08 19:39:30 <zaeph>	vifon: Oh I'm in full denim today, too, so I could *definitely* be on the poster.
Feb 08 19:39:33 <__monty__>	You gonna lace all of them straight?
Feb 08 19:40:04 <vifon>	Oh goddammit.
Feb 08 19:40:09 <__monty__>	These ones are nice (modulo me not being into the boot style).
Feb 08 19:40:11 <zaeph>	I'm not going to lasso all the straights into my bed, no.
Feb 08 19:40:43 <__monty__>	Le sigh.
Feb 08 19:40:56 <__monty__>	It was a serious question about lacing guys, not a gay joke.
Feb 08 19:41:08 <__monty__>	Lacing's a kink of mine.
Feb 08 19:41:27 <zaeph>	I like the perforations; the dark brown doesn't make them very super visible (less than on a lighter model), but they're a nice semi-formal option.
Feb 08 19:41:33 <__monty__>	I can already see you won't have many options because the laces are so short.
Feb 08 19:41:43 <energizer>	what's your take on how to make ranger fast on directories containing a large number of files?
Feb 08 19:41:44 <vifon>	zaeph: #nocontext
Feb 08 19:41:48 <zaeph>	Yeah, I prefer straight on leather shoes, frankly.
Feb 08 19:41:53 <zaeph>	energizer: Disable previews.
Feb 08 19:41:56 <zaeph>	`zp`
Feb 08 19:41:57 <vifon>	zaeph: So you like tanned guys with piercings?
Feb 08 19:41:57 <__monty__>	energizer: Run it with Pypy2 : )
Feb 08 19:42:14 <energizer>	__monty__: how long does `ranger /nix/store` take for you?
Feb 08 19:42:15 <zaeph>	Sec, phone.
Feb 08 19:42:22 <__monty__>	With pypy?
Feb 08 19:42:33 <energizer>	with whatever you use
Feb 08 19:57:02 <__monty__>	energizer: Hold on, nixpkgs insists on running the pypy test suite >.<
Feb 08 19:57:10 <__monty__>	It's pretty but it takes a while.
Feb 08 20:06:33 <zaeph>	vifon: I don't like piercings.
Feb 08 20:07:46 <zaeph>	__monty__: I probably don't have the lace length to do anything fancy, yeah, but straight is probably best for breaking in the shoes, since I have to tie/untie them quite a lot, and can't really afford the extra time it'd take to do something gay^W not straight.
Feb 08 20:08:54 <__monty__>	Straight lacing's actually not the most balanced though.
Feb 08 20:10:14 <zaeph>	Well, feel free to recommend alternative methods which wouldn't be a PITA to tie/untie, and which would work with my lace length.
Feb 08 20:18:48 <vifon>	zaeph: Ian's knot.
Feb 08 20:21:25 <__monty__>	That's for tying yes, not lacing though.
Feb 08 20:21:44 <vifon>	I'm too much of a scrub to see the difference.
Feb 08 20:21:53 <__monty__>	Make sure to lace them like this is you want to keep the straight lacing, https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/straightbarlacing.htm
Feb 08 20:22:42 <__monty__>	The only practical options you can probably use with your short laces are Army lacing, https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/armylacing.htm
Feb 08 20:22:53 <__monty__>	And Bow Tie lacing, https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/bowtielacing.htm
Feb 08 20:23:20 <__monty__>	Don't really recommend either over straight. But try them out to see if you like the look and feel maybe?
Feb 08 20:23:39 <zaeph>	Sure; thanks!
Feb 08 20:25:11 <__monty__>	Note that both of these methods are likely to increase the length of your lace ends slightly.
Feb 08 20:25:47 <zaeph>	Well, when you don't have the length, you better have the smarts.
Feb 08 20:26:36 <__monty__>	I used straight lacing on sneakers that had a lace snap. Over time they did warp a bit. The lacing had a tendency to loosen/tighten asymmetrically.
Feb 08 20:38:01 <energizer>	nix-build -E 'let pkgs = (import <nixpkgs> {}); in pkgs.ranger.override {python3Packages = pkgs.pypy2.pkgs; imagePreviewSupport = false;}'
Feb 08 20:38:18 <energizer>	still takes a while on the nix store tbh

Feb 08 20:47:37 <__monty__>	energizer: Is your store on an SSD?
Feb 08 20:48:03 <__monty__>	It's probably because ranger stats *all* the files in a directory when loading it.
Feb 08 20:48:11 <__monty__>	This is a known painpoint.
Feb 08 20:49:02 <energizer>	pcie ssd, 130k entries, about 12 seconds
Feb 08 20:49:55 <__monty__>	I'm not sure why you want to be browsing your store but if it's still too slow, check out hunter or lf.

Feb 10 13:19:52 <Luyin>	vifon: there is a nice video series (in German only, unfortunately) about everyday racism. the gist is, nobody wants to be racist (except a few, obviously), but we're all making racist statements at some points - not deliberately, but accidentally - and it will still hurt people.
Feb 10 13:20:00 <Pepe_vulgaris>	my two cents: words are not good or evil, etymolgically or otherwise, it all depends on the context, eg what the speaker meant
Feb 10 13:20:20 <ldlework>	"Nice. Shield yourself from having to justify your ideas by blocking people. That's healthy behavior, and as your internet friend, I approve."
Feb 10 13:20:25 <Luyin>	and it's not a problem to do that, because that's just normal human "error", but we can do our best to change it when we're confronted with it
Feb 10 13:20:29 *	ldlework shudders.
Feb 10 13:21:00 <vifon>	Luyin: Agreed in general but some cases are backfiring. Like this master branch thing.
Feb 10 13:21:06 <Pepe_vulgaris>	what does an audio engineer do when they prepare an album for production?
Feb 10 13:21:29 <ldlework>	Imagine thinking that because you have a contradiction or inconsistency in something you say, therefore the people who push back want to be racist, don't fundamentally agree with you, etc.
Feb 10 13:21:41 <vifon>	Pepe_vulgaris: Buy a few slaves to do it for him?
Feb 10 13:21:48 <eyJhb>	ldlework: Some just do it as it is easier...
Feb 10 13:21:54 <eyJhb>	vifon: Maybe zaeph is into that
Feb 10 13:21:56 <Luyin>	well it has technical repercussions, yes, but does that mean we should just leave everything as it is? no of course not. I think pointing to "renaming master breaks things" is not an excuse. it's like saying "renaming the apothecary around the corner to something not racist will confuse people"
Feb 10 13:22:20 <ldlework>	Like, is Luyin fundamentally correct about lingering racist cultural artifacts. Of course.
Feb 10 13:22:25 <Luyin>	Pepe_vulgaris: and yet we avoid certain words to avoid hurting people, don't we?
Feb 10 13:22:28 <Luyin>	or phrases
Feb 10 13:22:28 <vifon>	Master in this case has no slavery undertones.
Feb 10 13:22:34 <ldlework>	Are they indeed inconsistent on whitelist vs whitespace. Yes, they are inconsistent.
Feb 10 13:22:51 <vifon>	There are no slaves. It's a different meaning of this word.
Feb 10 13:22:52 <zaeph>	eyJhb: Well, technically, I'm a civil servant. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Feb 10 13:22:52 <ldlework>	When facing this inconsistency, instead of confronting it, they just assume the person pointing it out wants to continue the racism.
Feb 10 13:22:58 <vifon>	Like the master's degree.
Feb 10 13:23:01 <eyJhb>	zaeph: slave.
Feb 10 13:23:08 <eyJhb>	I am trying to find a scifi short about blocking people
Feb 10 13:23:14 <eyJhb>	But I can't fucking find it
Feb 10 13:23:16 <ldlework>	And then people who want to harm Luyin by helping them not confront it. Will say things like "Nice"
Feb 10 13:23:18 <ldlework>	When they self-harm.
Feb 10 13:23:22 <vifon>	Blacklist is more legitimate.
Feb 10 13:24:03 <vifon>	ldlework: Oh come on, it was just a joke. Don't take it either way.
Feb 10 13:24:11 <ldlework>	"Dont confront the feelings of holding an inconsistent position so you can eventually remedy the inconsistency, just feel good right now in the moment."
Feb 10 13:24:15 <Luyin>	vifon: whether or not the word itself is _supposed_ to mean that is not the problem
Feb 10 13:24:18 <ldlework>	vifon: it was snide as fuck
Feb 10 13:24:29 <Luyin>	*to be meant as an insult, sorry
Feb 10 13:25:10 <ldlework>	Pepe_vulgaris: ^
Feb 10 13:25:11 <Luyin>	I'm out of spoons for this discussion now, gotta retreat. I just wish for our happy little world to be happy not only for white people. I'm open to suggestions how else we could work towards that :)
Feb 10 13:25:20 <ldlework>	This is a fundamental difference I see.
Feb 10 13:25:37 <ldlework>	Whether or not intent is a variable in the calculus of crime.
Feb 10 13:27:32 <vifon>	Luyin: Can you stay a few more minutes?
Feb 10 13:27:40 <Luyin>	just one more link: https://news-sap-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/news.sap.com/2020/09/inclusive-language-more-inclusive-software-industry/amp/
Feb 10 13:27:49 <Luyin>	vifon: I wasn't going to leave, just not looking into the channel anymore :)
Feb 10 13:27:54 <vifon>	Let me just do a quick reboot, some issues.
Feb 10 13:27:56 <Luyin>	I've grown up a bit, too!
Feb 10 13:28:19 <vifon>	I mean, I wanted to make a quick counter-argument.
Feb 10 13:30:19 <vifon>	Luyin: In Polish we use the same word for a castle and a lock: "zamek".  Even if people in the past were legitimately oppressed by the people living in castles, it's no reason to change the word for a lock.
Feb 10 13:30:48 <Pepe_vulgaris>	I hate when people do that, tho.
Feb 10 13:30:48 <vifon>	This is how I see this "master" case.
Feb 10 13:30:57 <Luyin>	vifon: that's really not the point of the argument
Feb 10 13:31:03 <vifon>	Like I said, blacklist/whitelist is more legitimate.
Feb 10 13:31:37 <ldlework>	The point of the argument is, some people feel negatively from those words. Regardless of the etymology or history, we should work to make everyone feel as included as possible.
Feb 10 13:31:41 <vifon>	But chasing cases like "master" (or my hypothetical Polish "zamek") just makes the whole endeavor look silly.
Feb 10 13:32:07 <Luyin>	I don't think so
Feb 10 13:32:25 <vifon>	Hell, the word very similar to "collaborator" has very negative meaning in Polish.
Feb 10 13:32:30 <vifon>	Older people constantly notice it.
Feb 10 13:32:33 <ldlework>	Imagine getting mad at your friend because they used your stereo, or tv while you were not home. 
Feb 10 13:32:34 <eyJhb>	vifon: slaving?
Feb 10 13:32:40 <ldlework>	You may feel very strongly about them doing that.
Feb 10 13:32:42 <vifon>	eyJhb: Cooperating with nazis.
Feb 10 13:32:47 <Luyin>	I think whenever we can do a small change to include people more equally, and it's not a huge thing to ask, why shouldn't we do it? isn't it worth having to change our behaviour a little for others to feel more welcome?
Feb 10 13:32:50 <eyJhb>	vifon: You polish are WEIRD
Feb 10 13:33:03 <Pepe_vulgaris>	vifon: in hungarian, we only use that word in that sense
Feb 10 13:33:05 <zaeph>	vifon: 'collaborator' has the same undertones in French-speaking European countries as well, especially France.
Feb 10 13:33:05 <vifon>	Well, we did have some Nazi problems.
Feb 10 13:33:44 <ldlework>	Imagine getting mad at your friend because they used your stereo, or tv while you were not home. You may feel very strongly about them doing that. But if they had no expectation of you feeling this way, and therefore had no intent to cause you negative experience, then how can you genuinely, in the philosophically ethical sense, be mad *at* them. As in holding them accountable for how you feel.
Feb 10 13:33:48 <isene>	Anyone like to take my terminal RPN calculator for a test run? https://github.com/isene/T-REX
Feb 10 13:34:06 <ldlework>	You don't give your friend any ethical leeway, in consideration of what your friend actually intended by using your TV.
Feb 10 13:34:12 <vifon>	isene: Consider me interested.
Feb 10 13:34:21 <ldlework>	You simply look at what your friend *did*, and hold them to the nose for it.
Feb 10 13:34:23 <eyJhb>	isene: You have to join the debat before we can. We need a solution
Feb 10 13:34:38 <ldlework>	Imagine if criminal law worked this way.
Feb 10 13:34:40 <vifon>	And the last one at that, right, eyJhb?
Feb 10 13:34:52 <ldlework>	Imagine if minor social interactions between strangers worked this way....

Feb 10 13:41:45 <Pepe_vulgaris>	array index
Feb 10 13:42:06 <Pepe_vulgaris>	unless there are complex numbers
Feb 10 13:42:14 <ldlework>	that's syntactically what's being assigned to it
Feb 10 13:42:21 <ldlework>	what is the semantic meaning of i within this function
Feb 10 13:42:35 <ldlework>	anyway your time is up
Feb 10 13:42:59 <eyJhb>	What is it then?
Feb 10 13:43:03 <ldlework>	who knows?
Feb 10 13:43:11 <ldlework>	it depends on other single-letter variables
Feb 10 13:43:16 <ldlework>	and the function is just named "entry"
Feb 10 13:43:55 <ldlework>	well "num_format" I was looking at "entry" earlier
Feb 10 13:44:02 <ldlework>	nevertheless :)
Feb 10 13:44:05 <Pepe_vulgaris>	having a string operation done on it is rather fishy, yes
Feb 10 13:44:16 <Pepe_vulgaris>	s/on /to 
Feb 10 13:47:07 <eyJhb>	Those fuckers killed all my chickens in Minecraft. I only had like 2.000 :(
Feb 10 13:48:29 <vifon>	<ldlework> agreed, though there is a lot of single-letter variables 
Feb 10 13:48:30 <vifon>	http://www.matusiak.eu/numerodix/blog/2012/12/2/math-explained/
Feb 10 13:48:56 <eyJhb>	That just makes it more confusing if the none math ones are single as well :D
Feb 10 13:49:13 <zaeph>	eyJhb: https://youtu.be/HFVuAW9q1SQ?t=9
Feb 10 13:51:29 <eyJhb>	MERICA'?
Feb 10 13:52:19 <ldlework>	vifon: XD
Feb 10 13:52:53 <vifon>	2/10 letters, ldlework.
Feb 10 13:53:22 <vifon>	Also, usually we spell it as "dx".
Feb 10 13:53:37 <vifon>	It's not a multiplication, please don't swap them.
Feb 10 13:55:07 <isene>	ldlework: It's a short form inside that small function - "i" stands for the integer part of the number, "f" is the fractional part.
Feb 10 13:55:34 <isene>	eyJhb: Gimme a one-liner for the debate
Feb 10 13:55:53 <eyJhb>	vifon: DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO :D 
Feb 10 13:55:55 <ldlework>	isene: why not name it integerPart
Feb 10 13:56:12 <eyJhb>	isene: I have none, just saw that there was a lot of them in the code :p And didn't really tell me much
Feb 10 13:56:16 <eyJhb>	Also! I should be doing exam stuff
Feb 10 13:57:02 <isene>	I'm getting terser by the minute, that's why. Also, intermediate variable inside a small function...
Feb 10 13:57:30 <ldlework>	is that a small function?
Feb 10 13:57:35 <ldlework>	i was just going to recommend refactoring it
Feb 10 13:57:37 <isene>	I used to do lots of descriptive variable names, but for T-REX... he eats long variable names for breakfast
Feb 10 13:57:42 <vifon>	<isene> eyJhb: Gimme a one-liner for the debate
Feb 10 13:57:44 <vifon>	Ironic.
Feb 10 13:57:51 <isene>	:-)
Feb 10 13:58:16 <eyJhb>	You can have this? https://i.imgur.com/Md6eMmi.png
Feb 10 13:58:27 <eyJhb>	And then guess where this is used in wireless communication
Feb 10 13:58:44 <isene>	ldlework: it's only 21 lines of code (= small function)
Feb 10 13:59:04 <ldlework>	isene: from a testing perspective, i can't test just the parsing of "integer parts" nor "fractional parts", I must test the whole of number parsing (or whatever this function is doing in totality) at once
Feb 10 13:59:15 <ldlework>	a function is small when you cannot extract another function from it
Feb 10 13:59:47 <isene>	so, small-ish
Feb 10 14:00:26 <ldlework>	so small it took discussion on an IRC channel and description by the original author to figure out what it does
Feb 10 14:00:34 <isene>	eyJhb: That's kinda like a one-liner, but what's the debating I hear about?
Feb 10 14:01:32 <isene>	ldlework: Figuring out what it does is simple, talking about it is what breeds complexity
Feb 10 14:01:50 *	ldlework raises his eyebrows.

Feb 10 14:25:42 <GermainZ>	__monty__: yes since it's rounding to 0 so it appears like a perfectly flat line when it's not. The example given is exaggerated but it shows the rounding issue well, I think. (Same for the absolute/relative scale)
Feb 10 14:28:38 <GermainZ>	I don't think the example is useful for actual analysis/comparisons, just to show the point
Feb 10 14:32:20 <vifon>	What the hell.

Feb 10 16:25:27 <vifon>	*sigh*
Feb 10 16:26:29 <zaeph>	It must be nice for you to only have to think about those issues when you're trying to come up with puns or foster a sense of wit.
Feb 10 16:29:36 <zaeph>	Strawmaning is an awfully convenient way to keep your personal cocoon cozy, roomy, but also very samey.  It's getting a little tiring to discuss those issues in #ranger, and I'd be happier if we could tone it down.  I'm not asking you to change your mind, but merely to keep the toxic interactions to a better standard.
Feb 10 16:30:43 <__monty__>	Everyone please just stop.
Feb 10 16:30:59 <zaeph>	Oh *now* you show up!
Feb 10 16:31:13 <__monty__>	isene: Were you into running and emulating old HP calculators and stuff?
Feb 10 16:31:28 <__monty__>	I vaguely remember someone interested in that.
Feb 10 16:31:35 <__monty__>	FichteFoll maybe?
Feb 10 16:31:56 <zaeph>	__monty__: I think that was isene, yes.
Feb 10 16:32:01 <eyJhb>	zaeph: Disagree to agree, still the topic stands :) Whitenoise however is easier to fix however
Feb 10 16:32:15 <zaeph>	I remember a discussion going on between vifon and isene about buying a particular device.
Feb 10 16:32:15 <__monty__>	eyJhb: Stop, seriously.
Feb 10 16:32:35 <Pepe_vulgaris>	I weren't (just) trolling, I do believe that debating these issues is important. I accept that it has nothing to do with ranger.
Feb 10 16:33:27 <__monty__>	Let that be the last comment re this stuff today, please. Just let the topic cool down.
Feb 10 16:34:34 <eyJhb>	__monty__: That was not trolling the last part.... It was actually more of a informing thing, saying that whitenoise comes from the meaning of white light...... But OK
Feb 10 16:36:11 <vifon>	zaeph: In the end nothing came out of it.  I… don't think I can actually justify a fancy calculator. :D
Feb 10 16:37:45 <zaeph>	vifon: Probably wise; but on the other hand, if it sparks joy (#dontsuememarykondo), a flight of momentary folly has only killed a fraction of people.
Feb 10 16:49:03 <__monty__>	eyJhb: It's white noise, not whitenoise. And it's not contributing anything to #ranger.

Feb 11 08:47:19 <energizer>	what is tilda?
Feb 11 08:48:05 <zaeph>	energizer: https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda
Feb 11 08:48:52 <energizer>	ah
Feb 11 08:49:46 <zaeph>	isomari: Probably because noone got around to writing an image-preview script for it.  Chances are you could write something with w3m by refactoring some of the code, but I'd more readily advise you to consider *why* you're sticking with tilda.
Feb 11 08:50:20 <zaeph>	You might be interested in checking other terminal emulators like kitty.
Feb 11 08:51:11 <zaeph>	If you're attached to the non-window specificity of tilda, you can probably script something similar in your desktop-/window-manager.
Feb 11 08:51:27 <zaeph>	(I do that by storing a terminal in an i3 scratchpad.)

Feb 11 11:01:51 <zaeph>	grobi: Heya.
Feb 11 11:02:06 <grobi>	nice to meet you zaeph :)
Feb 11 11:03:08 <zaeph>	grobi: How's life?
Feb 11 11:03:18 <Luyin>	hi grobi zaeph \o/
Feb 11 11:05:28 *	grobi highfives Luyin. zaeph fine actually :)
Feb 11 11:08:53 <grobi>	we are snowed in, zaeph 
Feb 11 11:09:38 <Pepe_vulgaris>	what image "protocol" does tilda use?
Feb 11 11:09:54 <grobi>	and a part of the city has no heating
Feb 11 11:10:35 <Pepe_vulgaris>	hmm, it's VTE based so w3m preview should work anyways
Feb 11 11:13:31 <grobi>	tilda does not work with wayland as i could see..
Feb 11 11:14:03 <grobi>	did you try ueberzug Pepe_vulgaris ?
Feb 11 11:14:45 <Pepe_vulgaris>	grobi: nah, I find that too much of a hack
Feb 11 11:14:59 <__monty__>	VTE terminals work very poorly if at all with w3mimgdisplay.
Feb 11 11:15:16 <Pepe_vulgaris>	I have no problems with xfce4-terminal
Feb 11 11:15:31 <Pepe_vulgaris>	still better performance than urxvt, sadly
Feb 11 11:15:32 <__monty__>	That's great. But it's more luck than anything.
Feb 11 11:16:00 <Luyin>	termite \o/
Feb 11 11:16:00 <__monty__>	Best image support for the moment is terminology and kitty, with iTerm2 a close third.
Feb 11 11:16:11 <Luyin>	although termite's always a bit of a hassle when you ssh to a new server
Feb 11 11:16:33 <__monty__>	Luyin: You should be able to just install the termite terminfo though?
Feb 11 11:16:40 <Luyin>	sure
Feb 11 11:16:46 <Luyin>	but I always forget how to do that
Feb 11 11:16:52 <Luyin>	have to look it up, waste time... oh well
Feb 11 11:18:59 <__monty__>	Maybe take a look at kitty's ssh/terminfo/whatever-the-name kitten. It copies the terminfo over while connecting over ssh.
Feb 11 11:21:57 <Pepe_vulgaris>	you mean automatically?
Feb 11 11:24:17 <__monty__>	Well, you do have to explicitly use the kitten.
Feb 11 11:24:23 <__monty__>	But pretty much automatically.
Feb 11 11:26:19 <Luyin>	__monty__: I'm sure I'd just forget it again the next time I connect to a new server, so I'll look it up again anyway :D
Feb 11 11:26:28 <Luyin>	but it's actually a good idea to copy it over, yes
Feb 11 11:26:50 <__monty__>	You could alias or wrap ssh to always use the kitten though.
Feb 11 11:27:13 <Pepe_vulgaris>	I had a similar script for urxvt
Feb 11 11:31:01 <Luyin>	I'm not using kitten
Feb 11 11:32:55 <__monty__>	Luyin: I mean the kitten-equivalent script or whatever.
Feb 11 11:33:05 <__monty__>	Why do people always take words so literally?
Feb 11 11:34:01 <Luyin>	:D sorry, since I don't know what kitten is I wasn't aware you wanted me to transfer
Feb 11 11:36:28 <__monty__>	I said take a look at the kitten to then base a script off of that if you want to stick with termite (don't recommend termite though tbh, didn't have a positive experience when I was testing a score of terminals for ranger).
Feb 11 11:36:45 <__monty__>	Kitty has "kittens" which are python scripts that extend its functionality.

Feb 11 12:20:31 <grobi>	he didn't agree happily enough to his suggestions.. so be aware Luyin ;)
Feb 11 12:21:03 <zaeph>	A fitting end, considering how Bob was as moody as Commodus itself.
Feb 11 12:21:23 <zaeph>	For the non-connoisseur: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus#Assassination_(192)
Feb 11 12:21:28 <__monty__>	I don't understand why it's been *this* unstable lately.
Feb 11 12:25:58 <grobi>	.q RoboBob 3
Feb 11 12:25:58 <RoboBob>	(grobi) [3/3] <robobob> I'LL BE BACK

Feb 11 12:26:33 <RoboBob>	(zaeph) [11/11] <zaeph> You folks can interbreed, so as far as I'm concerned, you speak the same language.
Feb 11 12:26:43 <zaeph>	.q zaeph -0
Feb 11 12:26:43 <RoboBob>	(zaeph) [8/11] <zaeph> It's kinda small, though.
Feb 11 12:26:48 <zaeph>	Clever girl.
Feb 11 12:29:10 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to hut
Feb 11 12:35:20 <grobi>	.q RoboBob 5
Feb 11 12:35:22 <RoboBob>	(grobi) [5/5] <robobob> 4 zaeph: An intelligent hell would be better than a stupid paradise !:)
Feb 11 12:36:54 <zaeph>	I have no recollection of that one. 🤔
Feb 11 12:41:19 <grobi>	zaeph: take 5
Feb 11 12:42:03 <zaeph>	We don't accept Jazz in here, sorry.
Feb 11 12:42:09 <grobi>	now take 6
Feb 11 13:19:09 <Luyin>	__monty__: crossposted from #fish: 
Feb 11 13:19:12 <Luyin>	10:30 <Luyin> I think I screwed up my $PATH variable
Feb 11 13:19:13 <Luyin>	10:31 <Luyin> config.fish contains this: `set -x PATH ~/.bin ~/Code/telekom_url_convert $PATH`; echo $PATH in fish (I start it with `fish` out of zsh, not sure that's relevant so I thought I added it): https://paste.xinu.at/dVO/
Feb 11 13:19:15 <Luyin>	10:31 <Luyin> so everything is doubled
Feb 11 13:29:57 <__monty__>	I don't see any doubles?
Feb 11 13:30:30 <__monty__>	And if your zsh PATH is already fine you don't need to add anything in the fish config.
Feb 11 13:31:43 <zaeph>	For fuck sake. -.-
Feb 11 13:32:17 <zaeph>	Now the French admin is telling me that I've used the wrong form.  Couldn't they tell me that the first time? -.-
Feb 11 13:32:52 <zaeph>	Bureaucracy at its finest.
Feb 11 13:33:43 <zaeph>	Honestly, it's making me feel less miserable about my line of work leading to the destruction of jobs in the sector.
Feb 11 13:34:03 <Luyin>	__monty__: oh right, it's not actually doubled, the telekom_url_convert has two paths...
Feb 11 13:34:40 <Luyin>	__monty__: actually I'd like to get away from starting zsh and then stating fish explicitly. I'd rather start with fish right away and only keep zsh as a fall-back in case something isn't working out
Feb 11 13:35:06 <Luyin>	so I'd like my PATH to be handled by fish completely. is that possible?
Feb 11 13:36:54 <Luyin>	btw, /home/alex/.bin appears twice

Feb 11 16:33:11 *	Topic for #ranger set by __monty__!~toonn@unaffiliated/toonn (Tue Feb 12 19:41:59 2019)
Feb 11 17:02:15 <eyJhb>	Just putting this here as well - https://github.com/stephen304/castblock
Feb 11 17:02:43 <eyJhb>	Kinda cool, just tested it. And fore __monty__ and vifon , hopefully there will be a pkg of it tomorrow for Nixpkgs! (not like you can't use it atm. just in a nicer way)
Feb 11 17:03:40 <vifon>	I don't think I need it but thanks.
Feb 11 17:05:24 <eyJhb>	I didn't really mind the sponsor stuff normally, but atm. I am viewing a channel on Youtube which has 1 minute at the start of the video with sponsor stuff + 1-2 minute at the end, in a 7-9 minute video..
Feb 11 17:05:30 <eyJhb>	That's just too much...
Feb 11 17:10:16 <vifon>	Why bother?
Feb 11 17:11:18 <eyJhb>	Bother watching it, or bother setting it up?
Feb 11 17:11:58 <eyJhb>	Watching it - pretty fun animation channel. Setting it up - it is a simple fire and forget script, I can actually run it right now :p Doesn't depend on much
Feb 11 17:19:18 <eyJhb>	Luyin: Surely you meant to thank __monty__ for all the fish, because on the internet, nobody knows if you are a dolphin!
Feb 11 17:37:00 <vifon>	The former.
Feb 11 18:11:41 <grobi>	Huh, were is __monty__ ? 
Feb 11 18:14:44 <eyJhb>	vifon: It is just really chill - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70dplWEKqow , ran out of theOdds1out, ie. Soubway stories
Feb 11 18:14:59 <eyJhb>	grobi: sacrificed.
Feb 11 18:15:20 <grobi>	to whoooom eyJhb ?
Feb 11 18:15:37 <vifon>	eyJhb: The first 30 seconds sounds like me.
Feb 11 18:16:32 <eyJhb>	vifon: I know that feeling...
Feb 11 18:16:40 <eyJhb>	AND NOW! You can be addicted to that guys youtube
Feb 11 18:16:48 <eyJhb>	grobi: RoboBob. :D
Feb 11 18:16:55 <vifon>	I'm already addicted to Sseth since Saturday.

Feb 11 18:19:10 <vifon>	Also, I just learned mpv has a --sub-ass-force-style flag.
Feb 11 18:19:42 <grobi>	vifon: translation please :)
Feb 11 18:19:57 <eyJhb>	vifon: https://youtu.be/rOJdDvf-tUs?t=320
Feb 11 18:20:00 <eyJhb>	The hel
Feb 11 18:20:18 <vifon>	Damn, grepping `man mpv` for "force" is a trip…
Feb 11 18:20:54 <vifon>	eyJhb: What the…
Feb 11 18:22:09 <eyJhb>	I DON'T KNOW!
Feb 11 18:22:13 <grobi>	vifon: you wrote that book?
Feb 11 18:22:19 <eyJhb>	I searched for SSeth, and that was what came up
Feb 11 18:22:23 <vifon>	grobi: What book?
Feb 11 18:22:37 <grobi>	mpv's man pages?
Feb 11 18:23:47 <vifon>	Why would I be writing it?
Feb 11 18:24:20 <grobi>	sorry i got that wrong :°
Feb 11 18:25:14 <grobi>	ah. force=a_game
Feb 11 23:27:42 <GermainZ>	vifon: man mpv is a book, searching anything is a trip :D
Feb 11 23:28:02 <vifon>	But not every search result is a smut, GermainZ.
Feb 11 23:28:04 <GermainZ>	I wish there was an easy way to search for flags without having to resort to hacks that fail depending on the man page's exact formatting 
Feb 11 23:28:15 <vifon>	True.
Feb 11 23:28:38 <zaeph>	Not everything can be Emacs.
Feb 11 23:28:48 <vifon>	GermainZ: https://github.com/vifon/emacs-config/blob/master/emacs.d/vifon/my-fun.el#L97-L125
Feb 11 23:28:51 <GermainZ>	zaeph: the inverse is not true
Feb 11 23:29:08 <zaeph>	ERROR: Can't parse your sentence.
Feb 11 23:29:18 <GermainZ>	zaeph: Emacs can be everything
Feb 11 23:29:38 <vifon>	zaeph: He says some part of our inverse are false.  Like Mars.
Feb 11 23:30:08 <zaeph>	vifon: Are you sure you're not inbred?
Feb 11 23:30:19 <vifon>	Yes.
Feb 11 23:30:23 <zaeph>	(I'm not talking about baguettes.)
Feb 11 23:30:29 <vifon>	And I am sure the inverse is true.
Feb 11 23:30:37 <vifon>	The bred is in me, I'm eating right now.
Feb 11 23:30:44 <zaeph>	∴ you're inbred.
Feb 11 23:31:00 <vifon>	Is zaeph a predator?
Feb 11 23:31:05 *	zaeph croaks.
Feb 11 23:31:14 <zaeph>	Well, I'm a Discord mod.
Feb 11 23:31:20 <zaeph>	I'm dying to groom someone but nobody shows up.
Feb 11 23:31:36 <vifon>	Ask Drake for some tips.
Feb 11 23:31:55 <zaeph>	Nah, I'm doing a blind playthrough.
Feb 11 23:32:05 <zaeph>	…Which is validist.  Fuck.
Feb 11 23:32:14 <vifon>	Valley of Drakes is waiting for you still.
Feb 11 23:32:36 <zaeph>	Valley of Drakes was actually an area in Lineahe 2.
Feb 11 23:32:38 <zaeph>	Lineage 2*
Feb 11 23:32:53 <zaeph>	Eh, close enough: https://l2wiki.com/classic/Dragon_Valley
Feb 11 23:33:45 <GermainZ>	Man, fuck Valley of Drakes
Feb 11 23:34:30 <zaeph>	+1
Feb 11 23:34:37 <vifon>	Valley of Drakes has got nothing on Shrine of Amana.
Feb 11 23:37:40 <zaeph>	Sleep tight, folks.
Feb 11 23:37:49 <vifon>	GermainZ: How good are you with youtube-dl?
Feb 11 23:39:29 <vifon>	I want it to grab the whole channel but it only grabs the first page.
Feb 11 23:40:02 <GermainZ>	vifon: should be enough to give it the url
Feb 11 23:40:34 <vifon>	Noep.
Feb 11 23:40:43 <zaeph>	vifon: Use playlists?
Feb 11 23:40:49 <vifon>	How?
Feb 11 23:40:55 <GermainZ>	vifon: what channel?
Feb 11 23:41:00 <vifon>	https://www.youtube.com/c/SsethTzeentach/videos
Feb 11 23:41:22 <vifon>	I actually only want to grab the list of it to output into org-mode.
Feb 11 23:41:26 <GermainZ>	vifon: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUD6VugMZKRhSyzWEWA9W2fg&playnext=1&index=1 ?
Feb 11 23:41:31 <vifon>	So -j --flat-playlist and so on.
Feb 11 23:41:54 <GermainZ>	vifon: I just copied the URL of the "Play all" button near "Uploads"
Feb 11 23:42:04 <zaeph>	I was about to suggest the same.
Feb 11 23:42:38 <zaeph>	Yup, works for me.
Feb 11 23:42:48 <vifon>	Awesome, thanks.
Feb 11 23:42:55 <GermainZ>	\o/
Feb 11 23:42:59 <zaeph>	\o/
Feb 11 23:43:22 <zaeph>	I shall go to bed with the fuzzy feeling of having contributed to something good.
Feb 11 23:43:29 <vifon>	"Good"
Feb 11 23:43:37 <GermainZ>	"Contributed"
Feb 11 23:44:00 <zaeph>	You guys are the worst.
Feb 11 23:44:31 <GermainZ>	:D
Feb 11 23:45:02 <vifon>	zaeph: No, we're the baddest.
Feb 11 23:45:57 <vifon>	GermainZ: Context: when we were playing and talking via Mumble today, I asked zaeph what's the opposite of "better", with the answer (mine, not his) being "badder".  He hates me now.
Feb 11 23:46:13 <GermainZ>	:D
Feb 11 23:46:29 <vifon>	Also, result: https://einval.eu/upload/8iKo0D0YHxqBrKoygyuIQKSX.png
Feb 11 23:46:49 <GermainZ>	Neat
Feb 11 23:47:15 <vifon>	And this is how Emacs helps with mundane stuff.
Feb 11 23:48:53 <GermainZ>	Out of curiosity, does anyone use MS Teams here? Wondering how good it is on Linux / if the web version is better 
Feb 11 23:49:00 <vifon>	I use it in a browser.
Feb 11 23:49:17 <vifon>	I refuse it install this spyware directly.
Feb 11 23:50:11 <GermainZ>	Does it work well?
Feb 11 23:50:40 <vifon>	Well, it does work.

Feb 12 09:12:38 <zaeph>	Morning sunshines.
Feb 12 09:36:55 <Luyin>	I'm pretty happy with fish right now
Feb 12 09:36:57 <Luyin>	:D
Feb 12 09:45:09 <blawiz>	Luyin: why?(!)
Feb 12 09:49:16 <Luyin>	because I love the colours and auto-completion features
Feb 12 09:49:48 <Luyin>	also having a prompt that shows me git branches/states that just work without greater fiddling around with escape codes (they are the devil's work) is incredibly nice.

Feb 12 16:07:58 <zaeph>	Also: I've finally triumphed over French administration.
Feb 12 16:08:03 <zaeph>	They've granted me the paper I needed.
Feb 12 16:08:26 <zaeph>	It's a little Pyrrhic, though, considering the 4 attempts I had to file, but eh~~~~~.
Feb 12 16:09:09 <vifon>	zaeph: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WgOCRY45Os
Feb 12 16:18:40 <grobi>	nice boots zaeph !
Feb 12 16:20:13 <grobi>	these have the classy stile i ever wanted since i first saw them on "Dr House" in one episode..
Feb 12 16:42:28 <zaeph>	grobi: Huh, don't rememeber them.  But yeah, they are *damn* fine.
Feb 12 16:51:51 <grobi>	zaeph: genuine leather soles?
Feb 12 16:53:10 <zaeph>	grobi: Yup, and Goodyear-welt!
Feb 12 16:54:01 <grobi>	i have similar but in different leather..
Feb 12 16:56:38 <zaeph>	It's a fairly standard form, yeah.
Feb 12 16:56:38 <zaeph>	I like the commando sole, though.
Feb 12 17:00:05 <grobi>	mine are lasting about 20 years now
Feb 12 17:00:36 <zaeph>	I'm certainly hoping to get as much mileage from mine. :D
Feb 12 17:10:49 <grobi>	they need an 'upgrade' from the shoemaker again, but actually they still look pretty good: https://imgur.com/tDciGpf :D
Feb 12 17:11:29 *	grobi can't hardly believe that he is showing off his old boots here...
Feb 12 17:12:47 *	grobi blames the general pandemic confusion for this!
Feb 12 17:16:08 <zaeph>	grobi: They look pretty damn good.  Yeah, the rubber is a little worn out, but that's like 30-40 EUR at the cobbler.
Feb 12 17:16:41 <zaeph>	I'm wearing mine right now, and they might be the best pair of shoes I've ever worn. ; -;
Feb 12 17:17:21 <grobi>	:D
Feb 12 17:17:24 <zaeph>	I had some very similar Caterpillars 4y back, and I loved them to death, but they didn't really withstand the element (probably because I wasn't giving them any time to breathe).
Feb 12 17:17:40 <grobi>	go for it/them ! zaeph  :)
Feb 12 17:19:21 <grobi>	yes but the label doesn't produce as stable as it sounds ..
Feb 12 17:20:10 <zaeph>	grobi: Label?  You mean the brand of the rubber?
Feb 12 17:20:13 <grobi>	if one talks about CAT then everybody thinks about working-mashines and strong clothes
Feb 12 17:20:27 <zaeph>	Oh, right, CAT.
Feb 12 17:20:31 <grobi>	you said caterpillar
Feb 12 17:20:41 <zaeph>	I thought you were talking about your own pair.
Feb 12 17:20:49 <zaeph>	I think CAT still produce the ones I used to wear.
Feb 12 17:21:14 <grobi>	now i don't even know the label anymore..
Feb 12 17:21:39 <zaeph>	I think that's roughly the ones: https://www.catfootwear.fr/chaussures-homme/452-colorado-chocolate.html#/pointures-40
Feb 12 17:22:23 <zaeph>	Nope, that's the one, but with a slimer sole: https://www.catfootwear.fr/chaussures-homme/345-colorado-chocolate.html#/pointures-40
Feb 12 17:23:01 <grobi>	exactly them ihad once as well that color and a pair in blue (when i was young :) )
Feb 12 17:23:39 <zaeph>	I didn't know my tastes were German. :o)
Feb 12 17:23:59 <zaeph>	…Although I did date a half-German for 3y.
Feb 12 17:24:08 <vifon>	German tastes, and yet hailing from France.
Feb 12 17:24:29 <zaeph>	vifon: We call them 'collabos' here.
Feb 12 17:25:40 <grobi>	you can calm down zaeph, i think my taste is quite international .. and sometimes also very german :D
Feb 12 17:27:05 <grobi>	one off my favourite when i was a twen wer the DocMartins
Feb 12 17:27:33 <zaeph>	I've hesitated between Docs too, but I ended up going for CAT.  I preferred the matt stuff.
Feb 12 17:27:46 <zaeph>	…But now, I can have my cake and fuck it too, which is *great*.
Feb 12 17:29:10 <grobi>	:D
Feb 12 17:29:21 <vifon>	Wait, what?
Feb 12 17:29:42 <grobi>	* Doc Martens btw..
Feb 12 17:29:45 <zaeph>	vifon: You don't fuck your cakes?
Feb 12 17:29:49 <zaeph>	…Weirdo.
Feb 12 17:30:10 <vifon>	No, I don't, zaeph.
Feb 12 17:30:25 <zaeph>	You're missing out.
Feb 12 17:30:48 <vifon>	I cannot miss if I'm not even aiming.
Feb 12 17:31:04 <zaeph>	You miss 100% of the shots you don't take, fucko.
Feb 12 17:31:22 <grobi>	i'd like to do the .cookie but no ucking BoB around..
Feb 12 17:45:58 <eyJhb>	Who is going to add `try: catch:` to BoB?
Feb 12 17:46:47 <grobi>	eyJhb: `try: catch:`?
Feb 12 17:47:58 <eyJhb>	Just seem to remember Bob being coded in Python, not entirely sure
Feb 12 17:48:28 <eyJhb>	And there the perfect way for, I can't be arsed to do anything about it, is just to do `for: try: catch:`, so that whatever happens, it will just run
Feb 12 17:49:47 <grobi>	thus it's python's guiltiness that BoB is still not capable to sing and dance for us??
Feb 12 17:56:37 <eyJhb>	I blame vifon most of the time when bad things happens
Feb 12 17:56:51 <eyJhb>	If he does not answer, then it goes on to zaeph  or __monty__ , whoever has the shift at that point
Feb 12 17:57:05 <vifon>	eyJhb: Good. That means you acknowledge my divinity, and hence responsibility.
Feb 12 17:57:28 <eyJhb>	vifon: "RESPECT MY AUTHORITAAAAH"
Feb 12 18:03:00 <grobi>	eyJhb: one more shouting and we will let you lick the soles of our leatherboots. no matter how old they are..
Feb 12 18:03:24 <grobi>	:D
Feb 12 18:05:38 <zaeph>	I'm in a meeting, so not able to work right now.
Feb 12 18:05:41 <zaeph>	eyJhb: ^
Feb 12 18:05:55 <eyJhb>	zaeph: Do you ever "work"?
Feb 12 18:06:45 <zaeph>	eyJhb: Don't tell my bosses.
Feb 12 18:07:35 <grobi>	that could be a matter of defining 'work' 
Feb 12 18:07:58 <grobi>	zaeph: which 'boss' ?

Feb 12 19:09:01 <__monty__>	Yeah, that's creepy marketing practices, https://nitter.nixnet.services/marcan42/status/1360254475793932299#m
Feb 12 19:12:17 <grobi>	Ubuntu started to suck since  
Feb 12 19:12:53 <grobi>	*Unity
Feb 12 19:14:16 <grobi>	at that time i was considering to get me an 'UbuntuPhone'
Feb 12 19:14:41 <__monty__>	I don't get the Unity hate. It was a pretty decent desktop experience imo.
Feb 12 19:14:53 <__monty__>	Have heard way worse stuff about Gnome Shell.
Feb 12 19:15:17 <__monty__>	And if Ubuntu had stuck with Gnome back then everyone would've probably been mad about that.
Feb 12 19:15:18 <grobi>	and still i desperately want a foss_phone
Feb 12 19:15:40 <__monty__>	Can't recommend the puri.sm devices sadly.
Feb 12 19:16:03 <__monty__>	Don't think it gets more open source than that in phone land yet unfortunately.
Feb 12 19:16:32 <grobi>	right __monty__ i didn't mean that 'Unity' sucks but that time Ubuntu startet to look more and more comercial to me
Feb 12 19:17:16 <__monty__>	Maybe on the surface.
Feb 12 19:17:27 <grobi>	yes __monty__ a big pity actually
Feb 12 19:17:35 <__monty__>	Further down they were clearly always like that already.
Feb 12 19:17:43 <__monty__>	Even when I made my very first foss contribution.
Feb 12 19:18:05 <__monty__>	I still think Ubuntu is a net benefit for the foss community.
Feb 12 19:18:42 <grobi>	yes totally right __monty__ 
Feb 12 19:18:49 <__monty__>	Though I think it's fair to say Valve's done a lot more to promote mainstream usage.
Feb 12 19:20:36 <grobi>	i'm sorry that i let myself be carried away by this saying. i owe a lot to Ubuntu. especially a relatively smooth start into the Linux world
Feb 12 19:22:12 <grobi>	so i really shouldn't say that it sucks..
Feb 12 19:23:24 <__monty__>	If only the best linux was allowed to survive this channel'd be vifon, eyJhb and me. : P

Feb 12 19:31:45 <grobi>	the boot-up stucks a bit at the startjobs for networking, guess i need to install drivers..
Feb 12 19:32:35 <grobi>	so it actually works but the bootprocess slows down with that.. 
Feb 12 19:33:14 <__monty__>	Yeah could be a firmware issue.
Feb 12 19:33:38 <__monty__>	You could do "enableAllFirmware", then you don't have to figure out which one you need : )
Feb 12 19:33:42 <grobi>	so may i ask you experts for help when i will start it next time?
Feb 12 19:34:09 <__monty__>	Definitely, though you mighth get better answers faster in #nixos.

Feb 12 20:13:28 <__monty__>	Not replace outright, don't worry. Just slowly retiring.
Feb 12 20:13:37 <__monty__>	Starting with the more important features.
Feb 12 20:14:00 <__monty__>	Like .8ball and .usa
Feb 12 20:14:11 <vifon>	__monty__: Also, it cannot into Github.

Feb 12 22:22:02 <zaeph>	I've painted my mousepad soup-colour.  It doesn't look good.
Feb 12 22:22:17 <vifon>	What paint did you use, zaeph?
Feb 12 22:22:25 <zaeph>	Soup.
Feb 12 22:27:25 <__monty__>	inb4 zaeph paints his shoes with mustard next.
Feb 12 22:27:37 <vifon>	Or with the upside down ketchup.
Feb 12 22:27:49 <zaeph>	__monty__: You're laughing, but I almost painted the new shoe with soup as well.
Feb 12 22:28:25 <zaeph>	I've stopped buying ketchup; is mustard all the way now.
Feb 12 22:29:03 <__monty__>	Because of the animal cruelty involved with growing tomatoes?
Feb 12 22:29:10 <__monty__>	Like all the flies the tomatoes eat?
Feb 12 22:29:34 <zaeph>	More like the cruel amount of sugar in ketchup.
Feb 12 22:29:44 <zaeph>	It overpowers all the good sauces I'm making for my dishes.
Feb 12 22:30:02 <vifon>	zaeph: You must 'tard…
Feb 12 22:30:19 <__monty__>	You don't have curry ketchup?
Feb 12 22:30:26 <zaeph>	__monty__: I've never tried.
Feb 12 22:30:30 <__monty__>	I agree plain ketchup is gross and should just not exist.
Feb 12 22:34:21 <eyJhb>	WHAT!
Feb 12 22:34:52 <zaeph>	Found the zoomer.

Feb 15 09:18:33 <grobi>	hello, rangers !:)
Feb 15 09:18:46 <zaeph>	Morning!
Feb 15 09:19:58 <grobi>	zaeph already fresh and happy to work?
Feb 15 09:20:47 <zaeph>	grobi: No and no. :o)
Feb 15 09:21:00 <grobi>	^^?
Feb 15 09:21:15 <zaeph>	I did spend a significant part of the night browsing clothes on the web. ; -;
Feb 15 09:21:36 <Luyin>	morning you cuties.
Feb 15 09:21:43 <zaeph>	Hi!
Feb 15 09:21:56 <grobi>	o/ Luyin 
Feb 15 09:22:17 <Luyin>	pyenv doesn't seem to like my new fish setup. when I enter zsh _and_ explicitly start the virtualenv, it works. even though pyenv reports the venv is already activated. weird stuff.
Feb 15 09:22:50 <Luyin>	anyway, got tea and my other partner is over for the weekend until tomorrow morning <3 
Feb 15 09:23:36 <zaeph>	Enjoy!  On my end, I coped with long walks, music, and shopping therapy.
Feb 15 09:23:36 <grobi>	hmm fish has attitudes.. ask vifon about fish's relationship to Texas
Feb 15 09:24:36 <grobi>	So very valuable and sustainably used time .. zaeph :D
Feb 15 09:25:22 <Luyin>	lol
Feb 15 09:25:44 <zaeph>	Turning my 2nd floor into even more of a walking closet fills me with joy.
Feb 15 09:25:57 <zaeph>	I did spring-clean yesterday, and I only ended up retiring two pieces.
Feb 15 09:28:50 <grobi>	i skated all day even at night with my high-tech headlamp ..
Feb 15 09:29:49 <grobi>	before that I played the hero with another volunteer;)
Feb 15 09:30:34 <grobi>	wir haben die ganze Eisfläche eines kleinen Sees im Park mit Schneeschaufeln geräumt
Feb 15 09:31:05 <grobi>	sorry : we cleared the entire ice surface of a small lake in the park with snow shovels
Feb 15 09:32:04 <grobi>	and were celebrated for it by children and adults alike
Feb 15 09:59:01 <vifon>	grobi: Huh?
Feb 15 10:06:07 <grobi>	hi vifon :)
Feb 15 10:06:42 <vifon>	Hi, grobi.
Feb 15 10:07:15 <vifon>	I just woke up so I may be slow but I don't see why you've brought up Texas.
Feb 15 10:08:41 <grobi>	vifon: Luyin has issues of compability of his fish-setup with pyenv..
Feb 15 10:09:10 <grobi>	you remember my try to run Texas with fish?
Feb 15 10:09:20 <vifon>	Ah.
Feb 15 10:09:28 <vifon>	It's not supported at all.
Feb 15 10:09:42 <vifon>	Like, *at all*.
Feb 15 10:09:56 <Luyin>	texas isn't, or pyenv isn't?
Feb 15 10:10:16 <Luyin>	it might be valuable to say that I've got pyenv settings both in the zshenv and in config.fish
Feb 15 10:10:19 <grobi>	yes i remember
Feb 15 10:10:27 <Luyin>	so they're sourced both, probably
Feb 15 10:14:19 <vifon>	Luyin: Texas.
Feb 15 10:14:24 <vifon>	Or rather, Fish by Texas.

Feb 15 11:07:37 <vifon>	<colleague> vifon, shit's on fire.  Should we be worried?
Feb 15 11:07:39 <vifon>	<boss> Only by the fact vifon is on holidays.
Feb 15 11:08:06 <vifon>	But it was a quick thing only I could do, so I did.  And it was important.
Feb 15 11:08:42 <eyJhb>	And you got paid for the entire day I hope

Feb 23 18:41:39 <GermainZ>	it's been around for a while

Feb 23 18:42:31 <__monty__>	Isn't that MyPy?
Feb 23 18:42:44 <__monty__>	Afaik GVR is still with Dropbox?
Feb 23 18:43:05 <__monty__>	The company's kinda gotten irrelevant though, at least in my sphere.
Feb 23 18:43:07 <GermainZ>	No, I'm talking about something else. But you're right they're behind a big part of type checking / mypy
Feb 23 18:45:43 <GermainZ>	Okay, you're actually right on both counts and mypyc _is_ what I was thinking of after re-reading the blog post
Feb 23 18:46:35 <GermainZ>	My memory enjoys trolling me -- "oh, this mypyc thing looks like XYZ you read about a while back! I wonder what that could be called…"

Feb 25 20:36:25 <vifon>	Because we're not bullies.

Feb 25 20:46:34 <vifon>	And more importantly, how many more lists do you have?
Feb 25 20:46:43 <GermainZ>	and do you have an index list?
Feb 25 20:46:53 <zaeph>	vifon: You don't have the credentials for me to tell you that.
Feb 25 20:47:07 <vifon>	I make my own credentials.
Feb 25 20:47:15 <GermainZ>	Also, neo4j is very cool

Feb 26 19:53:12 <zaeph>	haska: Hi.  Could you link the issue?
Feb 26 19:53:24 <haska>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/issues/2016
Feb 26 19:54:06 <zaeph>	Apparently, this PR was supposed to address it: https://github.com/ranger/ranger/pull/2095
Feb 26 19:55:16 <zaeph>	I'm not sure what's holding up the PR; __monty__'s comment seem to have been addressed.
Feb 26 19:55:32 <__monty__>	A severe lack of time all around.
Feb 26 19:55:36 <zaeph>	That being said, since it's a cosmetic bug, it might have been low on their priority list.
Feb 26 19:55:39 <zaeph>	Yeah, exactly.
Feb 26 19:55:52 <__monty__>	Feel free to apply the patch and report on any errors or lack thereof you encounter.
Feb 26 19:56:43 <haska>	What is in developing now?
Feb 26 19:57:44 <__monty__>	Just going through the backlog of PRs, bug fixes first.
Feb 26 19:58:01 <__monty__>	But I don't have a lot of time for ranger.
Feb 26 19:59:04 <__monty__>	I've tried getting other contributors involved more but that takes even more time and the ones that seem most capable seem to have the least time.
Feb 26 19:59:36 <haska>	How many time for coding in free time do you have?
Feb 26 20:00:25 <__monty__>	There's at least one fork with an enthusiastic maintainer but the quality of their code isn't acceptable imo. They're just creating an even more unmaintainable mess.
Feb 26 20:00:43 <haska>	ranger's fork?
Feb 26 20:01:02 <__monty__>	I'll try to remember to look into the mime stuff soon.

Feb 26 20:04:48 <haska>	at ~
Feb 26 20:05:19 <zaeph>	Nothing too fancy, really.  projects/, downloads/, org/, src/, pkgs/, etc.
Feb 26 20:06:37 <haska>	hat is `org`?
Feb 26 20:07:00 <zaeph>	haska: I use Emacs, so all my notes.
Feb 26 20:11:07 <haska>	I'm searching for ideal of file organize, but there are only guides about real world: Marie Kondo, etc. I have never see big guides about cleaning computers, especially linux machines
Feb 26 20:12:08 <zaeph>	haska: Maybe you're worrying too much about this?  Thinking about your setup is good, but when it prevents you from working, it might be wise to stop worrying about this.
Feb 26 20:12:41 <__monty__>	I have bin, opt, src, recordings, books, papers and downloads, everything else just goes under ~ until it gets messy : )
Feb 26 20:13:20 <__monty__>	Oh, and a dir for videos.
Feb 26 20:13:30 <__monty__>	And one for notes.
Feb 26 20:13:44 <haska>	zaeph: i don't work :D - is this reason of worrying?
Feb 26 20:13:53 <__monty__>	And irc logs and activity logging.
Feb 26 20:13:57 <zaeph>	Nah, keep on living the life. 😎

Feb 26 20:15:06 <__monty__>	Nah, ~/bin
Feb 26 20:15:20 <__monty__>	That's for stuff I wrote.
Feb 26 20:15:22 <zaeph>	I use ~/.bin.
Feb 26 20:15:33 <zaeph>	Not sure why I've made it hidden. 🤔
Feb 26 20:15:34 <__monty__>	~/opt is for unpackaged programs others wrote.
Feb 26 20:16:49 <haska>	Do you use linux links (`ln -s`)?
Feb 26 20:17:23 <__monty__>	Yes, because really bin, opt and my configs are in ~/src/dotfiles

Feb 27 13:03:17 <blawiz>	is it usually hard to install a package on an outdated/offline computer?
Feb 27 13:04:35 <__monty__>	Yes.
Feb 27 13:04:41 <__monty__>	Because of recursive dependencies.
Feb 27 13:04:51 <__monty__>	And because most repositories drop old stuff.
Feb 27 13:05:08 <__monty__>	Nixpkgs is kind of uniquely adept at both of these things though.
Feb 27 13:05:17 <__monty__>	But the UX is kinda terrible.
Feb 27 13:06:12 <blawiz>	:[
Feb 27 13:07:09 <blawiz>	maybe easiest to try to compile it, but i guess maybe similar problems with that
Feb 27 13:07:43 <blawiz>	would static distro help here maybe?
Feb 27 13:16:56 <__monty__>	A bit but only for dependencies that are used for their shared libraries.
Feb 27 13:17:18 <__monty__>	That doesn't include data like fonts. Or programs that are shelled out to.
Feb 27 13:17:58 <__monty__>	With nix you can wrap up the entire closure of a package on a computer with access to nixpkgs and then copy that over.
Feb 27 13:18:31 <__monty__>	And the Nixpkgs binary cached so far does not erase any binaries, so you don't even have to build most old versions.
Feb 27 13:19:05 <__monty__>	Accessing the binary cached does require a network connection of course. Unless you can get a multi TB offline copy...
Feb 27 13:20:11 <__monty__>	And generating the closure of packages kinda requires a network connection because nix fetches all the sources. And finding all of those to provide them offline is about as hard as manually collecting all the binaries or packages.
Feb 27 13:21:24 <blawiz>	hmhmhm...
Feb 27 13:21:40 <blawiz>	kinda surprising its this hard eh
Feb 27 13:22:37 <__monty__>	Not really once you understand how complex writing software is.
Feb 27 13:23:30 <__monty__>	If you write a C program without dependencies, or with only C-library dependencies and you compile it statically then it's just one file to copy.
Feb 27 13:24:46 <__monty__>	If you write a program like ranger which has no dependencies except for the python interpreter you need to copy ranger (which is multiple files but is that really so much harder to copy than a single file?), then copy python, then copy python's deps, then copy python's deps' deps, then copy python's deps' deps' deps, etc. until there's no more deps.
Feb 27 13:24:51 <blawiz>	yeah, thats nice
Feb 27 13:26:14 <zaeph>	'Wait, it's all deps?'
Feb 27 13:26:17 <zaeph>	'Always has been.'
Feb 27 13:28:05 <__monty__>	It's deps all the way down.
Feb 27 13:28:27 <__monty__>	But some package formats aren't actually honest about their deps.
Feb 27 13:28:41 <__monty__>	This is what Nixpkgs has revolutionized.

Feb 27 21:57:05 <bdju>	is :touch not able to just update the modification time? without an arg it says the file already exists
Feb 27 21:57:27 <zaeph>	bdju: Did you provide the target?
Feb 27 21:57:35 <zaeph>	You need %s to designate the target.
Feb 27 21:58:02 <GermainZ>	pretty sure :touch in ranger is different from the shell touch, it's only for creating new files
Feb 27 21:58:21 <__monty__>	Yep.
Feb 27 21:58:23 <zaeph>	Yeah.
Feb 27 21:58:29 <bdju>	I was hoping it would assume the thing my cursor was on. didn't give a target
Feb 27 21:58:33 <bdju>	ah hm okay...
Feb 27 21:58:37 <zaeph>	Shouldn't be too hard to patch, though, depending on the use-case?
Feb 27 21:58:51 <__monty__>	Yeah, zaeph's a tit, you don't need to pass an argument.
Feb 27 21:58:53 <zaeph>	I think it actually assumes %s, judging by the error message that the file/dir already exists.
Feb 27 21:59:16 <zaeph>	__monty__: Well excuse~ me for trying to help.
Feb 27 21:59:21 <bdju>	I wanted to quick touch everything in a dir in a certain order
Feb 27 21:59:39 <GermainZ>	could make an alias for the shell touch
Feb 27 21:59:43 <zaeph>	That's how one end up in jail.
Feb 27 21:59:49 <GermainZ>	or !touch if it's just a couple of files
Feb 27 21:59:49 <zaeph>	ends*
Feb 27 22:00:02 <bdju>	GermainZ: interesting idea
Feb 27 22:00:10 <__monty__>	bdju: `map t shell touch %s`
Feb 27 22:00:18 <zaeph>	Why are we not doing this by default, though?  Do we need shielding?
Feb 27 22:00:39 <__monty__>	Because it's not something that makes sense imo.
Feb 27 22:01:08 <bdju>	__monty__: that worked great!
Feb 27 22:01:17 <bdju>	thanks
Feb 27 22:01:25 <zaeph>	It feels weird to be taking the name of a script, but not fully porting its capabilities, especially for something as abstractly co-opted as `touching`.
Feb 27 22:01:31 <__monty__>	mtime may be a bad reflection of the real last time a file was modified but why make it an even worse reflection?
Feb 27 22:01:58 <__monty__>	Touch is the logical name since "mkfile" doesn't exist.
Feb 27 22:02:04 <__monty__>	bdju: Np.
Feb 27 22:02:27 <zaeph>	I'm gonna make 'touchd' a thing.
Feb 27 22:02:45 <zaeph>	It's a bit of a vocational habit for me.
Feb 27 22:03:00 <__monty__>	To be clear. I'm not opposed to someone implementing all of touch's functionality as long as nothing breaks.
Feb 27 22:03:06 <__monty__>	Which is impossible afaict.
Feb 27 22:03:32 <__monty__>	Because we don't require escaping filenames so "touch -mtime blah" would create a file called "-mtime blah".
Feb 27 22:03:33 <zaeph>	Are we never offloading to shell for file manipulations?  Is it all implemented via Python?
Feb 27 22:03:44 <__monty__>	Even file copying is.
Feb 27 22:03:49 <zaeph>	Nice~.
Feb 27 22:03:51 <__monty__>	I think that should answer the question.
Feb 27 22:03:58 <zaeph>	It did.
Feb 27 22:04:20 <__monty__>	It's actually kinda impressive how much hut implemented.
Feb 27 22:04:25 <__monty__>	And how well it all works.
Feb 27 22:04:37 <__monty__>	Even though it's also all so terrible.
Feb 27 22:04:58 <zaeph>	Well, trust the Germans to make things both impressive and terrible.

Mar 09 20:34:30 <lonelykid>	Hi, I just tried the z plugin. It's actually not a z plugin. It only read z data file and matches with regex using python. z does not works as executable directly. It only injects functions to shell. I'm wondering if it's possible to really use z in ranger. fasd is great, but not maintained  for too long.
Mar 09 20:34:59 <GermainZ>	z?
Mar 09 20:35:51 <lonelykid>	z, autojump, fasd. they are similar tool. to cd to dir faster
Mar 09 20:36:40 <GermainZ>	Got a link to z? It's really tough to google
Mar 09 20:36:56 <GermainZ>	https://github.com/rupa/z ?
Mar 09 20:37:04 <wasamasa>	it's z shit
Mar 09 20:37:20 <lonelykid>	haha. https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Custom-Commands#z
Mar 09 20:37:24 <lonelykid>	you are correct
Mar 09 20:37:45 <lonelykid>	why you don't like z?
Mar 09 20:39:02 <GermainZ>	I wonder if using z along with https://github.com/vifon/texas for example would work for you, lonelykid 
Mar 09 20:39:25 <GermainZ>	Then you can just quit ranger, run z, and launch ranger again
Mar 09 20:39:45 <GermainZ>	Quit a lot of keystrokes tho
Mar 09 20:39:47 <GermainZ>	Quite*
Mar 09 20:40:18 <lonelykid>	it might be better to modify z to take args and run as executable. I can copy that part from fasd
Mar 09 20:40:44 <lonelykid>	just wondering if ranger could manage it without this hacking.
Mar 09 20:41:36 <wasamasa>	what are the odds you're using https://github.com/ask1234560/ranger-zjumper wrong
Mar 09 20:41:49 <wasamasa>	I mean, look at the code
Mar 09 20:41:54 <wasamasa>	it's pretty self-explanatory
Mar 09 20:42:14 <lonelykid>	I checked the code. it's not really using z at all. it's reading z data file and using it's own regex to match.
Mar 09 20:42:17 <GermainZ>	could modify z too
Mar 09 20:42:38 <wasamasa>	so make your own better thing, lol
Mar 09 20:42:49 <GermainZ>	wasamasa: you ok? :)
Mar 09 20:43:15 <lonelykid>	it's not a bad idea for zjumper to do that at all.
Mar 09 20:43:58 <lonelykid>	but i want to log path in ranger to z data file, like the autojump plugin does. then i will need to really call z.
Mar 09 20:45:51 <GermainZ>	looking at how z works I don't think you can do that directly
Mar 09 20:46:00 <GermainZ>	you'll need to either wrap your own wrapper or modify z
Mar 09 20:46:10 <GermainZ>	s/wrap /write /
Mar 09 20:47:22 <lonelykid>	yeah. thank you.
Mar 09 20:48:14 <lonelykid>	fasd already does this. so I think i can just paste
Mar 09 20:48:14 <lonelykid>	case $- in
Mar 09 20:48:15 <lonelykid>	  *i*) ;; # assume being sourced, do nothing
Mar 09 20:48:16 <lonelykid>	  *) # assume being executed as an executable
Mar 09 20:48:16 <lonelykid>	    if [ -x "$_FASD_SHELL" -a -z "$_FASD_SET" ]; then
Mar 09 20:48:17 <lonelykid>	      _FASD_SET=1 exec $_FASD_SHELL "$0" "$@"
Mar 09 20:48:17 <lonelykid>	    else
Mar 09 20:48:18 <lonelykid>	      fasd "$@"
Mar 09 20:48:18 <lonelykid>	    fi;;
Mar 09 20:48:19 <lonelykid>	esac
Mar 09 20:48:22 <GermainZ>	For your goal, it might be enough to modify the z plugin to write to the z data file
Mar 09 20:48:59 <lonelykid>	that might be more complicated. because when you add a new path. you will also need to update weight, i assume.
Mar 09 20:48:59 <GermainZ>	lonelykid: please don't paste multiple lines in IRC, it's spammy (and often buffered, so your messages actually get sent over 20 seconds). Use a paste bin instead
Mar 09 20:49:16 <lonelykid>	ok. sorry about that.
Mar 09 20:49:38 <GermainZ>	If fasd works already then that's certainly easier :)
Mar 09 20:50:45 <lonelykid>	it seems more powerful. but not maintained. although this kind of tool does not need much maintenance, it has been 9 years since it's actively updated.
Mar 09 21:02:25 <__monty__>	Does it have bugs?
Mar 09 21:02:46 <__monty__>	Otherwise, who cares? Stable software is best software.
Mar 09 21:03:54 <GermainZ>	For example, ranger
Mar 09 21:06:44 <lonelykid>	ah. maybe. I will give it a try.
Mar 09 21:07:04 <lonelykid>	to be fair. ranger is still under active development.
Mar 09 21:07:17 <GermainZ>	It has no bugs, however
Mar 09 21:23:33 <zaeph>	GermainZ: only features, no bugs.
Mar 09 21:27:24 <GermainZ>	zaeph: precisely 
Mar 09 21:28:07 <zaeph>	I think I've made #ranger both gayer and Britisher.
Mar 09 21:28:12 <zaeph>	This is my life's achievement.
Mar 09 22:24:42 <__monty__>	Says the gay guy who, since joining #ranger, has gotten into straight men's fashion blogs and started fancying a girl.
Mar 09 22:25:27 <zaeph>	Heh, osmosis I suppose.
Mar 09 22:25:48 <vifon>	zaeph: Oh, so you've gotten out of the reverse-closet?
Mar 09 22:25:59 <zaeph>	*uno reverse card*
Mar 09 22:26:08 <vifon>	Am…  Am I gay now?
Mar 09 22:26:33 <vifon>	Well, only one way to find out~~
Mar 09 22:26:37 <__monty__>	I'd appreciate advice about whether commas fit that sentence or no? I'm under the impression english often uses–these thought markers–in favor of commas.
Mar 09 22:26:44 <zaeph>	vifon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwWEGQ2kK6A
Mar 09 22:27:36 <zaeph>	__monty__: It's more of a French oral style, but yeah, it works in English too.
Mar 09 22:27:48 <zaeph>	It does give it an oral vibe, more so than em-dashes.
Mar 09 22:28:12 <vifon>	Can you stop, zaeph.
Mar 09 22:28:25 <vifon>	Too much "oral" and "French" for that one poor sentence.
Mar 09 22:28:25 <zaeph>	vifon: What, talking about oral stuff?
Mar 09 22:28:46 <zaeph>	Prude.
Mar 09 22:29:37 <vifon>	Excuse my shyness, mr zaeph.  I'm just nervous.
Mar 09 22:29:53 <zaeph>	vifon: I'll be gentle, ma petite fleur.
Mar 09 22:30:14 <__monty__>	Hah, you fool! They were *en* dashes!
Mar 09 22:30:15 <vifon>	Gentile?
Mar 09 22:30:52 <__monty__>	Though in *mono*space fonts I'll admit the difference is pure pedantry.
Mar 09 22:31:21 <vifon>	Yeah.
Mar 09 22:31:26 <vifon>	I accept "--" though.
Mar 09 22:31:35 <vifon>	"---" being just too much.
Mar 09 22:32:03 <zaeph>	__monty__: You'd actually put em-dash there, though.
Mar 09 22:32:11 <zaeph>	En-dashes are for ranges.
Mar 09 22:32:17 <vifon>	There are very few places for an en-dash.
Mar 09 22:32:20 <vifon>	Yeah, ranges.
Mar 09 22:32:25 <zaeph>	#ranges.
Mar 09 22:32:33 <vifon>	And it's the end of this list.
Mar 09 22:32:46 <zaeph>	Thank you, Mr Schindler.
Mar 09 22:32:58 <__monty__>	I vaguely recall reading that the proper symbol for it *isn't* em dashes though 🤔
Mar 09 22:33:13 <zaeph>	Fine, I'll open my books.
Mar 09 22:34:16 <__monty__>	Hmm, reading the wiki page it seems like I could quite literally replace all the punctuation on my keyboard with em dashes.
Mar 09 22:34:33 <__monty__>	Well, except for my precious interrobang maybe.
Mar 09 22:34:54 <zaeph>	__monty__: https://paste.xinu.at/dzs/
Mar 09 22:35:07 <zaeph>	Chicago Manual of Style, 17th.
Mar 09 22:36:00 <__monty__>	Yes, but
Mar 09 22:36:18 <__monty__>	Style guides outside the US are more variable. For example, The Elements of Typographic Style by Canadian typographer Robert Bringhurst recommends the spaced en dash – like so – and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash "belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography"
Mar 09 22:36:33 <__monty__>	In the United Kingdom, the spaced en dash is the house style for certain major publishers, including the Penguin Group, the Cambridge University Press, and Routledge.
Mar 09 22:37:14 <__monty__>	The unspacedness of the em dash usage rubs me the wrong way.
Mar 09 22:38:06 <zaeph>	Let me read Bringhurst.
Mar 09 22:39:02 <vifon>	Me too, but mostly because the em-dash style is also regional and in Poland we almost always space them.
Mar 09 22:39:40 <vifon>	s/Poland/Polish/
Mar 09 22:39:48 <__monty__>	I could standardize on em dashes surrounded by hair spaces.
Mar 09 22:40:06 <vifon>	Well, Poland in general too, but then it's a semi-error if it's English.
Mar 09 22:42:06 <zaeph>	Well, my historical typography books are failing me.
Mar 09 22:44:00 <vifon>	ｈｙｓｔｈｅｒｉｃａｌ　ｔｙｐｏｇｒａｐｈｙ
Mar 09 22:44:15 <__monty__>	Anyway, we used to translate "bijzinnen" (parenthetical statements is close but not quite correct translation I think?) from latin between commas—always.
Mar 09 22:47:22 <zaeph>	I can't find the quote from the Bringhurst book. >.<
Mar 09 22:47:52 <vifon>	These are made up words/

Mar 09 22:48:36 <zaeph>	Ah~, here it is: https://paste.xinu.at/UI8SB/
Mar 09 22:49:46 <zaeph>	The Wikipedia article seems quite opinionated.
Mar 09 22:50:21 <zaeph>	I prefer semi-colons anyway.
Mar 09 22:51:06 <__monty__>	Semi-colons don't work for parenthetical (or whatever the proper name is) statements though.
Mar 09 22:51:16 <vifon>	So colons then?
Mar 09 22:52:23 *	vifon clicks the link
Mar 09 22:52:34 <vifon>	zaeph: Why does Typescript care about dashes?
Mar 09 22:53:51 <zaeph>	__monty__: Yeah, you're right.  Honestly, I've gravitated toward polarising my parentheticals between commas and parenthesis (depending on the level of remoteness to the current context); em-dashes are just too confusing, especially in francophones circles where em-dashes live at a non-defined spot between commas and parentheses.
Mar 09 22:54:42 <__monty__>	vifon: Because gradual typing can't bridge a gap the size of an em dash.
Mar 09 22:55:37 <__monty__>	Btw, em dash doesn't seem to be hyphenated anywhere I've come across it so far.
Mar 09 22:56:10 <__monty__>	Em dashes don't even seem to need to appear in pairs.
Mar 09 22:56:23 <__monty__>	It's like the WD40 of typography.
Mar 09 22:56:45 <zaeph>	Pretty much, yeah.
Mar 09 22:56:59 <zaeph>	It's like pragmatics in general linguistics: stick it whenever you can't formalise it.
Mar 09 22:57:27 <__monty__>	More and more I've started thinking typography is just concerned with superficial aesthetics so I might as well please *my* aesthetic sensibilities.
Mar 09 22:57:32 <zaeph>	It makes it a very amorphous mark, but amorphous doesn't do too well in clear communication.
Mar 09 22:57:56 <zaeph>	__monty__: Oh by all means do; I've completely reclaimed the semi-colon as a result of a similar stance on my end, and I'm having a blast.
Mar 09 22:59:49 <__monty__>	Semi-colon is too confusing for my taste.
Mar 09 23:00:46 <vifon>	> colon
Mar 09 23:00:49 <vifon>	> taste
Mar 09 23:00:52 <vifon>	Please, no.

Mar 18 09:33:52 <zaeph>	Heya.
Mar 18 09:57:04 <Luyin>	hi!
Mar 18 10:07:00 <eyJhb>	I have found out, after doing a SHIT TON of Google Captchas, that I suck at them
Mar 18 10:07:02 <eyJhb>	I am the worst AI
Mar 18 10:07:21 <zaeph>	Or you could be the worst human.
Mar 18 10:10:00 <zaeph>	I mean: if you're doing badly at a test supposed to ascertain your humanity, it wouldn't be a stretch to conclude that.
Mar 18 10:10:02 <eyJhb>	zaeph: Sorry, no, I am the best human.
Mar 18 10:10:22 <eyJhb>	Because it is human to make errors.
Mar 18 10:10:27 <zaeph>	In a solipsistical way, yes.
Mar 18 10:35:01 <GermainZ>	your face is what's solipsistic
Mar 18 10:36:08 <Luyin>	at least he has a face!
Mar 18 13:53:03 <vifon>	eyJhb: Careful, this is how you get banned from driving a car.
Mar 18 13:54:10 <Luyin>	hi vifon 
Mar 18 13:54:29 <vifon>	Hi, Luyin.
Mar 18 13:54:34 <Luyin>	how's it going?
Mar 18 13:54:40 <vifon>	Same old.
Mar 18 13:54:57 <Luyin>	nice
Mar 18 13:55:17 <vifon>	Work, depression and galactic conquest.
Mar 18 13:55:26 <vifon>	And you?
Mar 18 13:56:38 <Luyin>	vampire the masquerade, and lots of meetings.

Mar 22 12:28:31 <zaeph>	Luyin: Morning^WHello!
Mar 22 12:29:10 <__monty__>	Good morning.
Mar 22 12:29:28 <zaeph>	Tsk.
Mar 22 12:35:21 <ldlework>	I'm just fishing (cuz I'm desperate) but any of you guys play with neural style transfer stuff?
Mar 22 12:35:57 <__monty__>	I might know a guy.
Mar 22 12:36:23 <vifon>	hut: Maybe you?
Mar 22 12:36:46 <ldlework>	I'm having a general problem of style-splotchiness. Here's neural-style-pt, with the base-image turned off (so just style output), you can see how the style only takes hold in little nucleation sites: https://i.imgur.com/5HnQ5nW.jpg
Mar 22 12:36:55 <__monty__>	More seriously, I know someone who spent some time working with those brainwave sensors to control simple games.
Mar 22 12:37:25 <ldlework>	I only get this for some style/input images and so I'm trying to understand what causes this so I'm not wasting so much time.
Mar 22 12:37:36 <ldlework>	This is supposed to be the surface of the moon.
Mar 22 12:37:49 <__monty__>	Oh, that sounds completely unrelated. Was thinking of brain-computer interfaces.
Mar 22 12:38:19 <ldlework>	I'm kind of surprised that there are no ML-Art communities that I can find.
Mar 22 12:38:26 <ldlework>	/r/deepdream and that seems to be it
Mar 22 12:40:17 <__monty__>	ldlework: I seem to recall someone either in #nixos-chat (or #haskell-offtopic) doing fractal art. Maybe you can find them if you search logs.
Mar 22 13:03:06 <vifon>	__monty__: Bio-feedback?
Mar 22 13:04:35 <vifon>	I used to use it medically as a patient.  It was pretty much shit, at least back in the day.  It essentially boiled down to me clenching my jaw with just the right force.  Or maybe I just hacked the system.
Mar 22 13:06:50 <__monty__>	It was slightly better than that.
Mar 22 14:02:48 <wasamasa>	zaeph: I've pondered this event recently and wondered why exactly it is that I tend to remember attractive or otherwise remarkable females, but forget the rest
Mar 22 14:03:25 <wasamasa>	zaeph: the most charitable interpretation is that attractive == remarkable
Mar 22 14:09:10 <__monty__>	That's just how brains work, you only notice things that stand out.
Mar 22 14:09:29 <__monty__>	Most people are kinda delusional about their perception.
Mar 22 14:15:59 <__monty__>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Mar 22 14:23:12 <wasamasa>	I found it tough to answer "She really grew up, didn't she?" when I didn't remember much at all
Mar 22 14:25:55 <vifon>	Just don't answer with "She was cuter back then". It's a trap.
Mar 22 14:40:49 <grobi>	o/ can anyone here share experiences with using 'exa' instead of 'ls' ?
Mar 22 14:41:45 <__monty__>	Don't use it but some of what it does looks cool.
Mar 22 14:42:10 <__monty__>	ldlework uses a different, obscure rust reimplementation of ls.
Mar 22 14:42:29 <__monty__>	Oh, no. I'm confusing ldlework with supersandro2000 maybe.
Mar 22 14:42:46 <grobi>	you mean ':DON'T USE IT' or just you don't?
Mar 22 14:42:56 <__monty__>	I don't use it.

Mar 22 14:47:56 <vifon>	grobi: There are some incompatibilities I didn't like, I don't remember which.  I tried aliasing it.
Mar 22 14:48:04 <vifon>	And "exa" doesn't flow that well.

Mar 22 16:45:31 <vifon>	Do… we even support animated previews?  In any way?  __monty__?
Mar 22 16:46:19 <vifon>	bitmunch: You seem to have some rifle.conf directives in your rc.conf.
Mar 22 16:46:21 <vifon>	It won't fly.
Mar 22 16:47:31 <vifon>	And in general adding animations would be a hack on top of a hack.

Mar 23 17:10:12 <__monty__>	Choo choo! 🚂
Mar 23 17:18:53 <x10d>	hi
Mar 23 17:19:46 <vifon>	Hi, x10d!
Mar 23 17:20:29 <vifon>	And welcome to the cult.
Mar 23 17:20:44 <__monty__>	Good morning, x10d 
Mar 23 17:21:38 <__monty__>	Daily indoctrination sessions are at eight. And they're mandatory.
Mar 23 17:22:03 <x10d>	;)
Mar 23 17:32:17 <vifon>	__monty__: A bit of context, x10d is the newest Nix cultist^Wuser I mentioned. :)
Mar 23 17:33:31 <x10d>	so the indoctrination has begun, i see.... :>
Mar 23 18:00:04 <__monty__>	vifon: I'd already made an ass of us, don't worry ; )
Mar 23 18:21:56 <zaeph>	I thought I had to sign off on any addition to the crew.
Mar 23 18:21:58 <zaeph>	Rude.

Mar 23 20:38:29 <__monty__>	Ugh, collating upper before lower case is so stupid...
Mar 23 20:39:01 <zaeph>	Which program?
Mar 23 20:39:39 <__monty__>	Everything.
Mar 23 20:39:44 <__monty__>	ls in this case.
Mar 23 20:40:19 <zaeph>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 23 20:41:24 <x10d>	usually console progs do like that
Mar 23 20:42:19 <__monty__>	It's like people who sort directories before files.
Mar 23 20:42:29 <__monty__>	Stop perverting my alphabet!
Mar 23 20:42:33 <zaeph>	Well that's divisive.
Mar 23 20:47:08 <x10d>	hmm... all in all mc does both with default settings
Mar 23 20:47:31 <__monty__>	Madness!
Mar 23 20:47:34 <x10d>	didn't think bout that, despite like mc
Mar 23 20:48:53 <zaeph>	x10d: You've been here for a day and you've already talked twice about the-file-manager-that-shall-not-be-named.
Mar 23 20:49:10 <zaeph>	You should at least try to hide your sombre intentions.
Mar 23 20:49:52 <x10d>	zaeph: rather think about what I can talk about in a week :>
Mar 23 20:50:10 <zaeph>	such iconoclasm, much wow.
Mar 23 20:50:47 <x10d>	surely rude here, right? :>
Mar 23 20:51:10 <zaeph>	We welcome dissent from anyone but ourselves.
Mar 23 20:51:13 <__monty__>	Turn to the dark side, x10d.
Mar 23 20:51:21 <__monty__>	We use nix and ranger.
Mar 23 20:51:25 <__monty__>	It's great.
Mar 23 20:51:32 <zaeph>	Occasionally Emacs.
Mar 23 20:51:44 <__monty__>	There's always only *one* though, maintainer that is.
Mar 23 20:51:54 <vifon>	Oh boy, is it eight already?
Mar 23 20:52:05 <x10d>	indeed, vifon
Mar 23 20:52:30 <__monty__>	It's definitely 2100 hours over here.
Mar 23 20:53:57 <vifon>	Well, crap.  Again still working at 21:00…  I took a few breaks too many.
Mar 23 20:54:04 <__monty__>	Heh, just realized. There's two kinds of maintainers. Those who maintain ranger. And those who maintain emacs so much they never get around to maintaining ranger : >
Mar 23 20:54:21 <vifon>	I feel personally attacked, __monty__.
Mar 23 20:54:22 <__monty__>	Join the club, bae
Mar 23 20:54:34 <__monty__>	>.> <.< >.>
Mar 23 20:54:36 <zaeph>	I feel *I* was the one being attacked here.
Mar 23 20:54:48 <vifon>	I would debate your point but I'm too busy maintaining my Emacs.
Mar 23 20:55:08 <__monty__>	I was more or less attacking everyone but GermainZ.
Mar 23 20:55:19 <zaeph>	Tell you what: if the little stunt I'm preparing does work out wrt Emacs, I'll be true to my word and come help out for ranger.
Mar 23 20:55:31 <GermainZ>	\o/
Mar 23 20:58:15 <vifon>	<__monty__> It's like people who sort directories before files. 
Mar 23 20:58:17 <vifon>	What's wrong with that, __monty__?
Mar 23 20:58:26 <x10d>	vifon: it seems that maintaining emacs is an end in itself 
Mar 23 20:59:10 <zaeph>	x10d: Now try telling that to a vimmer.
Mar 23 20:59:40 <zaeph>	You can't reason with those people.
Mar 23 20:59:45 <vifon>	Well, my gf heard a few times "sorry, I'm busy, I'm tinkering in my Emacs".  It's a hobby.
Mar 23 20:59:55 <x10d>	zaeph: i can even say that i don't like vim :>
Mar 23 20:59:57 <zaeph>	We *get* it, you have a gf.  Gods. 🙄
Mar 23 21:00:44 <vifon>	Well, excuuse me, princess!
Mar 23 21:00:56 <zaeph>	vifon++
Mar 23 21:01:36 <vifon>	BTW, she got her COVID suspicion confirmed today.
Mar 23 21:01:47 <ldlework>	rip
Mar 23 21:01:49 <x10d>	uuu
Mar 23 21:02:18 <zaeph>	vifon: Well, hopefully nothing than resting won't address.
Mar 23 21:02:22 <__monty__>	I would say something along the lines of "Emacsers... le sigh" but I stayed up late yesterday and spent some more time today getting search engines with a custom url into firefox.
Mar 23 21:02:39 <zaeph>	ldlework: This ain't it, chief.
Mar 23 21:03:06 *	ldlework blinks.
Mar 23 21:03:11 <__monty__>	vifon: Time to get tested.
Mar 23 21:03:35 <vifon>	__monty__: She's literally over 100 km from where I am.  No need to.
Mar 23 21:04:05 <vifon>	And I saw her over a month ago.
Mar 23 21:04:17 <zaeph>	vifon: SSH connection still counts as contact.
Mar 23 21:04:42 <vifon>	Shit, she was VPN-ed into my LAN a few days ago.
Mar 23 21:04:51 <zaeph>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 23 21:05:21 <x10d>	hmm... in fact, if she is 100km from where you are... that she can be somewhere near me... :|
Mar 23 21:05:25 <__monty__>	Very Promiscuous Networks
Mar 23 21:05:42 <vifon>	x10d: Near Bełchatów, so yeah, closer to you than me.
Mar 23 21:06:04 <x10d>	that's far from me, also
Mar 23 21:06:49 <zaeph>	__monty__: Nice~.
Mar 23 21:07:22 <__monty__>	Surely poland cannot be this big? Think about it, they don't even make sausage links that long so how would all the Poles have telephony and internet service? 🧠✨
Mar 23 21:08:06 <vifon>	You underestimate our sausages.
Mar 23 21:09:08 <vifon>	Now somebody pass me a kiełbasa.
Mar 23 21:09:24 <zaeph>	__monty__: Pretty sure Belgium's network is carried by French fries.
Mar 23 21:10:05 <__monty__>	zaeph: Yes, but Belgium's small enough for this.
Mar 23 21:11:19 <zaeph>	*whisper* Optical fiber for 22 EUR/month.
Mar 23 21:11:40 <zaeph>	1 GBps up/down, bayby~~
Mar 23 21:16:23 <__monty__>	Belgium's not big enough. The photons can't get enough of a run up to get to Gbs.
Mar 23 21:18:57 <x10d>	maybe they use whole Benelux
Mar 23 21:19:07 <zaeph>	__monty__: Aw, we should have collaborated with you folks for the CERN, then.
Mar 23 21:20:36 <__monty__>	I think the point of CERN was to get them sped up not hold them back.
Mar 23 21:21:00 <__monty__>	Also, we? Isn't CERN in Switzerland?
Mar 23 21:21:17 <zaeph>	Plenty of Frenchies working on it.
Mar 23 21:21:18 <__monty__>	And literally built to test a Belgian's hypothesis? : p
Mar 23 21:21:45 <zaeph>	'the organization is based in a northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco–Swiss border'
Mar 23 21:22:25 <zaeph>	You're in it, stop crying: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN#Founding_members
Mar 23 21:26:50 <x10d>	So... for now it comes out: if you want to have an optical network, you must use CERN, which is twice as much than the area you want to cover
Mar 23 21:27:00 <x10d>	pretty good optimization 
Mar 23 21:27:45 <x10d>	*much further*
Mar 23 21:35:39 <vifon>	It also allowed us to at last bootstrap GHC using LHC.
Mar 23 21:35:55 <vifon>	__monty__: You should be happy GHC isn't just a theory anymore.
Mar 23 21:36:01 <zaeph>	Way too many initialisms.
Mar 23 21:36:33 <x10d>	vifon: you're back after eating sausage? :P
Mar 23 21:36:58 <zaeph>	Wouldn't you like to know, sonny-boi.
Mar 23 21:37:01 <vifon>	We sub-130 WPM typists need to be efficient, zaeph.
Mar 23 21:37:12 <zaeph>	Don't 'we' me into that, punk.
Mar 23 21:37:32 <vifon>	cc GermainZ
Mar 23 21:37:36 <zaeph>	no.
Mar 23 21:37:36 <__monty__>	Yes, please stop all the wee play.
Mar 23 21:37:39 <zaeph>	uncc GermainZ 
Mar 23 21:37:45 <vifon>	Uncle GermainZ?
Mar 23 21:37:51 <zaeph>	step-brother~~~
Mar 23 21:37:55 <vifon>	ｕｎｃｃ
Mar 23 21:38:12 <zaeph>	he uncc, he protecc
Mar 23 21:39:17 <vifon>	I'm listening to this "new" (2019) In Flames album.  It's… not good, but it's not as much of a dumpster fire as the last 2 or 3.
Mar 23 21:40:59 <vifon>	I really have no idea what they are trying to do.  I don't think there was a good In Flames album in over 15 years.
Mar 23 21:41:23 <zaeph>	Well, can you blame them?  I don't have an idea what I'm trying to do either.
Mar 23 21:41:33 <vifon>	Touché.
Mar 23 21:42:20 <zaeph>	Oh, FF 88 has been released.
Mar 23 21:42:27 <vifon>	I wish they could muster some more of that "The Jester Race" and "Whoracle" sound.
Mar 23 21:42:33 <zaeph>	'To prevent user data loss when filling out forms, we’ve disabled the Backspace key as a navigation shortcut for the back navigation button. To re-enable the Backspace keyboard shortcut, you can change the about:config preference browser.backspace_action to 0.

Mar 23 21:42:39 <vifon>	1996 and 1997 respectively… *sigh*
Mar 23 21:42:54 <vifon>	zaeph: 87? Not 88?
Mar 23 21:42:57 <vifon>	Blah.
Mar 23 21:43:00 <zaeph>	87, sorry.
Mar 23 21:43:01 <vifon>	zaeph: 88? Not 87?
Mar 23 21:43:30 <zaeph>	Changelog: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/87.0/releasenotes/
Mar 23 21:43:45 <vifon>	The search matches on the scrollbar are too small but nice to have.
Mar 23 21:43:46 <zaeph>	I'm not sure if I'd like to reenable <Backspace>.
Mar 23 21:44:00 <zaeph>	It has backstabbed many times in the past.
Mar 23 21:44:05 <vifon>	Especially since they were present in Chrome since its inception, IIRC.
Mar 23 21:44:21 <vifon>	I either disabled this backspace thing, or never stumbled at it.
Mar 23 21:44:46 <zaeph>	I can remember a handful of frustrating moment when tabbing and backspacing.
Mar 23 21:45:39 <zaeph>	Oof, I'm still on 84 on my Arch machine.
Mar 23 21:46:15 <vifon>	Why use Arch if you're not updating hourly?
Mar 23 21:46:27 <zaeph>	vifon: I'm in prod.
Mar 23 21:46:31 <x10d>	aha, 78.8.0 here....
Mar 23 21:46:31 <zaeph>	I've been in prod for 6 months.
Mar 23 21:46:41 <vifon>	Prod?  On Arch?
Mar 23 21:46:45 <zaeph>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 23 21:47:08 <zaeph>	Not all of us can afford to fuck off for two weeks to set up NixOS.
Mar 23 21:47:53 <vifon>	That's what this "vacation" thing is for.

Mar 23 21:51:00 <vifon>	I suspected it's fucked by someone, but no, that's how our code formatter does it and we stick to it most of the time.
Mar 23 21:51:02 <zaeph>	But that is some terrible indentation.
Mar 23 21:51:14 <vifon>	It's Perl, that's a normal reaction.
Mar 23 21:51:37 <zaeph>	Y'all monks are cray-cray.
Mar 23 21:51:46 <zaeph>	No wonder you get paid so much.
Mar 23 21:52:25 <vifon>	Yeah, sure.
Mar 23 21:52:37 <vifon>	Inflation, baby.
Mar 23 21:52:51 <vifon>	<x10d> aha, 78.8.0 here....

Mar 23 21:53:53 <x10d>	;]
Mar 23 21:53:56 <zaeph>	Jokes on you: there's no such thing as Nix handbook.

Mar 23 21:54:34 <zaeph>	updix for harambe?
Mar 23 21:54:36 <vifon>	:D
Mar 23 21:55:38 <__monty__>	I'm on 86.0.1 because I manually bump but only when firefox nags me.
Mar 23 21:56:19 <__monty__>	I stopped using <BS> forever ago. Have used Cmd+[ ever since.
Mar 23 21:56:36 <zaeph>	Btw, has any of you figured out how to revive keywords on FF mobile?  I use 'you foo' in my toolbar on Linux to search videos on YouTube, but they've deprecated that feature on FF mobile a couple of versions ago.
Mar 23 21:56:39 <__monty__>	I think Ctrl+[ might be the same on linux.
Mar 23 21:56:47 <zaeph>	__monty__: Doesn't work here.
Mar 23 21:56:53 <zaeph>	Nevermind, it does.
Mar 23 21:56:55 <zaeph>	Thanks!
Mar 23 21:57:05 <zaeph>	That's actually pretty cool.
Mar 23 21:57:15 <__monty__>	Ctrl+] for backwards backwards.
Mar 23 21:57:23 <zaeph>	Yeah, I figured.
Mar 23 21:57:34 <zaeph>	I think that'll be closer on my keyboard than M-<arrows>
Mar 23 21:57:37 <__monty__>	Way better than arrow keys.
Mar 23 21:57:48 *	__monty__ looks at the arrow key cluster in disgust
Mar 23 21:57:51 <__monty__>	┌─┐
Mar 23 21:57:51 <__monty__>	┴─┴
Mar 23 21:57:51 <__monty__>	ಠ_ರೃ
Mar 23 21:58:07 <zaeph>	Well, arguably, the arrows are on a quick layer on my Moonlander, so it's not that much of an issue.
Mar 23 21:58:19 <zaeph>	But I'm on my laptop's keyboard right now, so it feels more convenient.
Mar 23 21:58:24 <vifon>	I just press both the thumb modifiers and B or N.
Mar 23 21:58:28 <vifon>	Simple, ain't it?
Mar 23 21:58:40 <zaeph>	Found the plancker.
Mar 23 21:59:53 <vifon>	zaeph: Still on Moonlander, BTW?
Mar 23 22:00:01 <zaeph>	Yup; still as good.
Mar 23 22:00:19 <zaeph>	I keep meaning to get back to the Planck for creating macros on it.
Mar 23 22:00:21 <__monty__>	You don't spend Moonlander money on a keyboard and then admit to buyer's remorse, vifon.
Mar 23 22:00:40 <zaeph>	__monty__: Clearly, my keeb spending habits have been dwarfed by my clothing spending habits.
Mar 23 22:00:54 <zaeph>	So, no, don't worry: this is not coming from a position of sunk-cost.
Mar 23 22:01:42 <vifon>	So your buyer's remorse isn't scoped?
Mar 23 22:02:13 <zaeph>	🙄
Mar 23 22:04:31 <vifon>	zaeph: A game about deciphering an ancient language, it's on sale.  Maybe you're interested?  https://store.steampowered.com/app/774201/Heavens_Vault/
Mar 23 22:04:42 <vifon>	I bought it yesterday but I'm yet to play.
Mar 23 22:04:48 <zaeph>	Heaven's Vault?  More like Deus Vult.
Mar 23 22:05:01 <vifon>	Nah, that's what I've been playing last week.
Mar 23 22:05:04 <RoboBob>	(vifon) Heaven's Vault - From the creators of massively-branching interactive adventure 80... - Adventure, Indie - released 16 Apr, 2019 - $8.79 (was $21.99)
Mar 23 22:05:10 <vifon>	THANKS, BOB.
Mar 23 22:05:23 <vifon>	__monty__: Bob's kinda slow again.
Mar 23 22:05:25 <zaeph>	33 seconds.
Mar 23 22:05:30 <zaeph>	Mildly retarded.
Mar 23 22:05:37 <vifon>	That's what I said.
Mar 23 22:05:42 <zaeph>	You didn't use 'retarded'.
Mar 23 22:05:47 <zaeph>	So PC of you.
Mar 23 22:06:34 <zaeph>	Frankly, not enthused about playing games right now.  Building my real-life pyramid scheme is much more fun.
Mar 23 22:07:56 <__monty__>	vifon: She's just as fast as she likes to be. Nothing to be done.
Mar 23 22:08:04 <vifon>	"She"?
Mar 23 22:08:16 <zaeph>	Surely loading those Steam videos aren't helping.
Mar 23 22:08:18 <vifon>	Is Bob a she?

Mar 23 22:11:19 <zaeph>	Found the pythonista.
Mar 23 22:12:46 <__monty__>	No, python's actually terribe for alignment.
Mar 23 22:13:02 <zaeph>	Even if you use Jedi?
Mar 23 22:13:04 <vifon>	This alignment is chaotic evil, __monty__.
Mar 23 22:13:28 <zaeph>	None of us if fun at parties, we know that, right?

Mar 23 22:13:37 <vifon>	zaeph: That's not code a Jedi would indent.
Mar 23 22:13:56 <__monty__>	We'd be the life of the party at the FOSDEM afterparty though.
Mar 23 22:14:02 <vifon>	It's a Shit coding.
Mar 23 22:14:03 <zaeph>	Clearly.

Mar 23 22:49:03 <zaeph>	They should get the Mike from Dirk Gently on this.
Mar 23 22:49:11 <zaeph>	I'm sure his computers could solve this one out.
Mar 23 22:49:33 <zaeph>	Not Mike.
Mar 23 22:49:38 <zaeph>	Richard?
Mar 23 22:49:51 <__monty__>	Don't you mean Dirk?
Mar 23 22:50:07 <zaeph>	Dirk's the detective; Dick's the one with the computer and the sofa stuck in the corridor.

Mar 23 23:16:41 <__monty__>	Finally done.
Mar 23 23:16:41 <zaeph>	TL;DR: Reddit admin shenanigans.
Mar 23 23:16:42 <__monty__>	Don't have to clock out manually because arbtt does it for me.
Mar 23 23:16:56 <zaeph>	Oh wow, you've stuck with it?
Mar 23 23:16:56 <__monty__>	It's great.
Mar 23 23:16:56 <zaeph>	Any feedback after those last 4-5 months?
Mar 23 23:16:56 <__monty__>	Ugh, more RMS drama.
Mar 23 23:17:16 <zaeph>	Not the r/ukpolitics one, but yeah, RMS is also back on the FSF board,
Mar 23 23:17:24 <zaeph>	Everyone in the FSF crew is bracing for impact.
Mar 23 23:20:38 <__monty__>	https://rms-open-letter.github.io/
Mar 23 23:21:06 <__monty__>	Seems a bit like a personal crusade tbh.
Mar 23 23:21:16 <zaeph>	Has it ever been anything but that?
Mar 23 23:21:33 <zaeph>	At least, for those who voice their concerns in such a way.
Mar 23 23:21:44 <zaeph>	I don't think the FSF did a particularly good job of handling it in 2019, though.
Mar 23 23:23:28 <zaeph>	Did they just move the old Medium articles to a website to give it the veneer of formalism?
Mar 23 23:23:51 <__monty__>	Pretty much.
Mar 23 23:23:57 <zaeph>	https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88

Mar 23 23:24:12 *	GermainZ grabs popcorn
Mar 23 23:24:20 <zaeph>	Yeah, looks like it just is a streamlined version.
Mar 23 23:24:20 <__monty__>	The original medium article is now linked as a source, making it that much more credible.
Mar 23 23:24:33 <zaeph>	Oh yeah, you're right.
Mar 23 23:24:51 <GermainZ>	I'm slightly disappointed with the lack of lively discussions
Mar 23 23:24:53 <GermainZ>	I expected more, zaeph
Mar 23 23:25:44 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I'm consensual af.
Mar 23 23:25:56 <zaeph>	How do you think I landed a job in government?
Mar 23 23:26:27 <GermainZ>	Having the willingness to show up for one hour per week?
Mar 23 23:26:50 *	x10d_ is now known as x10d
Mar 23 23:26:57 <zaeph>	Yo.
Mar 23 23:27:05 <zaeph>	It was *two* hours.
Mar 23 23:27:09 <GermainZ>	:D
Mar 23 23:27:45 <zaeph>	That list of backers for the motion just feels like an e-penis flailing contest.
Mar 23 23:30:21 <zaeph>	Grep 'former' on the page for giggles.
Mar 23 23:36:23 <vifon>	I'm glad these people wanting rms gone are so open-minded and not "ableist" themselves.
Mar 23 23:39:09 <vifon>	For me it's pretty clear that at least the half of his "crimes" are him getting autistically stuck on semantics and losing the view of the bigger picture.
Mar 23 23:41:45 <zaeph>	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Mar 23 23:45:27 <GermainZ>	vifon: does that make them ok?
Mar 23 23:45:45 <GermainZ>	If they were calling for legal action then I'd agree it's overblown
Mar 23 23:45:49 <GermainZ>	But as it is it seems just blown
Mar 23 23:45:51 <vifon>	That's makes them pretty much in the same league as attacking him now.
Mar 23 23:45:58 <vifon>	Except not intentional.
Mar 23 23:46:02 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Just like your face.
Mar 23 23:46:19 <vifon>	Yeah, face. :>
Mar 23 23:46:26 <GermainZ>	vifon: how so?
Mar 23 23:46:28 <zaeph>	ಠ_ಠ
Mar 23 23:47:32 <vifon>	GermainZ: They say he's a misogynist etc., here they are autismphobic.
Mar 23 23:48:01 <vifon>	Except one of them may be an unconscious result of a mental condition.
Mar 23 23:48:06 <vifon>	That needs a talk, not cancelling.
Mar 23 23:48:06 <GermainZ>	vifon: if someone is autistic and makes misogynistic comments, does that mean they are no longer making misogynistic comments?
Mar 23 23:48:21 <vifon>	See my last line.
Mar 23 23:48:35 <vifon>	Have they ever talked with him about it?
Mar 23 23:48:37 <GermainZ>	vifon: sure, I can agree with that. Counseling would've a great move prior to him being reinstated for example
Mar 23 23:48:39 <vifon>	Somehow I doubt it.
Mar 23 23:49:23 <GermainZ>	But I do not agree that the best course of action is not to challenge his position. IMO, both actions are warranted and should come hand in hand (him stepping down, and going for counseling)
Mar 23 23:50:11 <zaeph>	He could decide to come out and live his life as a gay man.
Mar 23 23:50:15 <zaeph>	Worked out alright for Spacey.
Mar 23 23:50:19 <vifon>	If he were to be in a council of some feminist organization, it would be a very bad fit.
Mar 23 23:50:21 <zaeph>	/s.
Mar 23 23:50:32 <vifon>	But it's not one.
Mar 23 23:50:35 <vifon>	It's FSF.
Mar 23 23:51:08 <GermainZ>	vifon: I think we've discussed this already earlier so I'm not gonna beat a dead horse. As I said before, I disagree but it's not important and I get where you're coming from
Mar 23 23:51:19 <vifon>	And if there is a single person caring for the free software, this is him.
Mar 23 23:51:38 <zaeph>	Not me? ʕ ´•̥̥̥ ᴥ•̥̥̥`ʔ
Mar 23 23:51:54 <vifon>	Sorry, zaeph, but you cannot compete with rms in this race.
Mar 23 23:52:01 <zaeph>	But I'm white!
Mar 23 23:52:02 <vifon>	GermainZ: Agreed.
Mar 23 23:52:18 <__monty__>	What I consider uncalled for is demanding the resignation of the entire FSF board.
Mar 23 23:52:34 <GermainZ>	zaeph: you're way too charismatic to replace him
Mar 23 23:52:46 <GermainZ>	(It's not necessarily a compliment, the same could be said about a rock)
Mar 23 23:52:46 <zaeph>	ᕕ( ᐕ )ᕗ
Mar 23 23:52:53 <zaeph>	ಠ_ಠ
Mar 23 23:52:56 <vifon>	FSF is… inconvenient enough I'm willing to assume there are bad corporate actors involved.
Mar 23 23:52:56 <GermainZ>	__monty__: true
Mar 23 23:53:35 <vifon>	Especially because of this point.
Mar 23 23:53:57 <vifon>	Both rms and FSF are inconvenient.  Corporations don't like GPLv3.
Mar 23 23:54:13 <GermainZ>	I don't see a need for a conspiracy theory when the software community is insanely diverse, personally
Mar 23 23:54:36 <GermainZ>	So this just seems like a reflection of typical discourse to me
Mar 23 23:54:55 <__monty__>	Corporations actually seem to prefer copyleft more and more. Means their competitors can't run off with it for profit.
Mar 23 23:55:11 <zaeph>	OSPO are the new black; corporations *love* them, and so does the EU.
Mar 23 23:55:17 <GermainZ>	OSPO?
Mar 23 23:55:22 <zaeph>	Open Source Programming Office.
Mar 23 23:55:32 <vifon>	__monty__: I'll believe when I see Bash 4 on macOS.
Mar 23 23:55:36 <zaeph>	It's the new fad for companies to pilot their OSS policies.
Mar 23 23:55:39 <GermainZ>	__monty__: GPL as well?
Mar 23 23:55:47 <zaeph>	GermainZ: https://todogroup.org/
Mar 23 23:55:49 <__monty__>	They're anally retentive about python code formatting, zaeph?
Mar 23 23:56:17 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Especially the GPL.
Mar 23 23:56:20 <zaeph>	__monty__: The new black, not the new Black.
Mar 23 23:56:48 <GermainZ>	__monty__: you mean for code they're open sourcing, rather than libraries they may want to use?
Mar 23 23:56:55 <zaeph>	Look at all those chickens: https://todogroup.org/members/
Mar 23 23:57:02 <__monty__>	GermainZ: Yes.
Mar 23 23:57:09 <GermainZ>	__monty__: yeah, makes sense I guess
Mar 23 23:57:28 <vifon>	Honestly, if our 4 would be rms-grade politically, I'm sure we would get cancelled a long time ago with some unfortunate quote.
Mar 23 23:57:47 <__monty__>	But they don't seem to mind it as much for libs anymore either. They just code-vomit a years worth of hacky changes they made every year.
Mar 23 23:57:47 <zaeph>	Not me; I could reverse uno them to death.
Mar 23 23:58:02 <GermainZ>	__monty__: heh
Mar 23 23:58:30 <zaeph>	vifon: We wouldn't be cancelled for that; the sarcasm is obvious in our tone.
Mar 23 23:58:42 <zaeph>	…And we're nowhere near a position of influence anyway.
Mar 23 23:59:11 <__monty__>	Uh, zaeph, do you even realize how bespelled you are by me?
Mar 23 23:59:18 <zaeph>	We're the spokes of a wheel that turns on and on towards the inevitable wall.
Mar 23 23:59:34 <vifon>	The wheel must turn, eh?
Mar 23 23:59:42 <zaeph>	__monty__: Oh I'm fully aware that I have a full-blown case of Stockholm syndrome.
Mar 24 00:00:08 <GermainZ>	vifon: I wouldn't compare our shitposting to some of RMS' musings. But yes, some people would take offense with some things we joke about
Mar 24 00:00:20 <zaeph>	GermainZ: How dare you.

Mar 24 00:01:56 <zaeph>	Me, the guy who's an expert in blowing stuff.
Mar 24 00:02:05 <zaeph>	Including hot air balloons.
Mar 24 00:02:22 <vifon>	I can confirm zaeph's expertise.
Mar 24 00:02:34 <GermainZ>	:D

Mar 24 13:29:09 <vifon>	zaeph: FYI, transpose-regions is my new favorite Emacs command.  I've been able to cut my multiple-cursors usage down by half thanks to it.
Mar 24 13:31:01 <vifon>	It utilizes the mark ring for one of the regions and the current mark & point for the other.  You place the mark on both sides of the first region (yes, that's a double C-SPC each time usually) and then just select the other.  Run the command and boom, swapped.
Mar 24 13:31:08 <vifon>	I thought you might enjoy it.
Mar 24 13:31:46 <zaeph>	vifon: I'll test-drive it later; thanks!
Mar 24 13:32:04 <vifon>	The docs are a little confusing, so just follow my explanation.

Mar 24 13:33:14 <zaeph>	I rarely use transpose-sexp, especially not with lispy.

Mar 24 13:33:34 <zaeph>	I gotta induct you into lispy one day.
Mar 24 13:36:08 <GermainZ>	So it lets you select two regions and swap them?
Mar 24 13:37:02 <zaeph>	Yes.

Mar 24 21:26:59 <grobi>	how many hours zaeph ?
Mar 24 21:27:30 <zaeph>	grobi: Not that long, 2h30, and I covered 12km.

Mar 24 21:34:20 <zaeph>	I actually collected reddish sand that is specific to that forest; my dad ordered me a bunch.
Mar 24 21:34:44 <zaeph>	(no anakin joke pls.)
Mar 24 21:34:46 <grobi>	:)
Mar 24 21:36:29 <vifon>	I already exceeded my prequel memes quota for today.
Mar 24 21:37:05 <zaeph>	So uncivilised.
Mar 24 21:38:57 <grobi>	What did Yoda say to Anakin on his wedding day?
Mar 24 21:39:54 <zaeph>	This: https://paste.xinu.at/ucHYg/
Mar 24 21:41:52 <grobi>	.slap zaeph 
Mar 24 21:41:53 *	RoboBob hits zaeph in the chest with a sack of rocks.
Mar 24 21:42:00 <zaeph>	grobi--
Mar 24 21:42:51 <grobi>	zaeph↓↓
Mar 24 21:43:40 <__monty__>	How can you be in a meeting while hiking?
Mar 24 21:43:59 <zaeph>	__monty__: Remote conferencing, bayby~.
Mar 24 21:44:01 <__monty__>	Also, you spend so much time in meetings, wth? Do you even have any time to be productive in?
Mar 24 21:44:22 <__monty__>	What sort of meeting doesn't require any notes/documentation to reference though?
Mar 24 21:44:38 <__monty__>	This all sounds very bureaucrat-y.
Mar 24 21:44:42 <zaeph>	Well I do have daily meetings Mon-Fri and 4h of meetings on Saturday; that's the baseline.
Mar 24 21:44:56 <zaeph>	__monty__: The ones where *I*'m not the one taking the notes.
Mar 24 21:44:59 <__monty__>	Stop wasting my tax dollars!
Mar 24 21:45:14 <grobi>	__monty__: the meeting was this kinda: https://paste.xinu.at/ucHYg/
Mar 24 21:45:31 <zaeph>	Well, this is a completely business-centric endeavour, so don't worry about the taxpayer's monee.
Mar 24 21:45:32 <__monty__>	You just have to sit there and listen?
Mar 24 21:45:46 <grobi>	thus id was productive anyhow..
Mar 24 21:46:00 <zaeph>	No, but frankly, 'meeting' might be a stretch here; it's just a chat à la Agile stand-up meeting.
Mar 24 21:46:17 <zaeph>	…Except that ever since I've joined this group, they've steadily grown in length.
Mar 24 21:46:50 <grobi>	__monty__: 'important people' have 'meetings'
Mar 24 21:47:39 <zaeph>	But I'll readily admit that I'm part of many many groups, and that this takes an inordinate amount of time.
Mar 24 21:47:47 <zaeph>	…Hopefully the pay off will be there.
Mar 24 21:47:56 <grobi>	lol 'they have steadily grown in lenghts' 
Mar 24 21:48:08 <zaeph>	Grow up.
Mar 24 21:48:50 <grobi>	not for you hon
Mar 24 21:48:58 <zaeph>	Sassy twat.
Mar 24 21:50:32 <grobi>	how to enjoy a hike this way, zaeph ?
Mar 24 21:51:10 <__monty__>	But the point of an agile stand-up meeting is to get to work right after?
Mar 24 21:51:11 <zaeph>	Well, I'd already been hiking for 1h30 at this point, and I had my headphones on, so it wasn't all that strenuous.
Mar 24 21:51:26 <zaeph>	__monty__: Alright; coffee chat, then?
Mar 24 21:51:39 <__monty__>	And don't you need any reference material to share what you're doing?
Mar 24 21:51:54 <zaeph>	It's mostly informal.
Mar 24 21:52:08 <zaeph>	The discussions are interesting, but we usually have someone to take notes.
Mar 24 21:52:16 <__monty__>	This doesn't sound very productive at all.
Mar 24 21:52:31 <zaeph>	Well, it works for us.
Mar 24 21:53:25 <zaeph>	I'm tired of the diktats of productivity at all cost; I'm fine going on my merry way in the woods without having to worry too much about having the bestest, most productivest meeting in the world.
Mar 24 21:54:08 <__monty__>	I'd rather have a 20 min productive meeting and then 40 min to do with as I please.
Mar 24 21:54:24 <zaeph>	It's usually what we aim for, yeah.
Mar 24 21:54:36 <zaeph>	Today was a particularly long day because of the RMS debacle.
Mar 24 21:55:37 <grobi>	well i believe you zaeph and better to go for a walk with headphones on than no walk at all
Mar 24 21:55:55 <zaeph>	grobi: True; but I did spend most of the walk without them, and it was great.
Mar 24 21:56:15 <zaeph>	I could test-drive the new shorts, and hiking in near-summer gear, and that was great.
Mar 24 21:56:56 <grobi>	most time i go out i refuse to be 'on' at all.. (not even phonecalls)
Mar 24 21:57:22 <zaeph>	I do the same, except when my walk is overlapping with that particular slot.
Mar 24 21:58:01 <grobi>	bu i still work '925' so i can do so
Mar 24 21:58:14 <grobi>	*but
Mar 24 21:58:34 <zaeph>	Well, hopefully you'll be on holiday soon enough.
Mar 24 21:58:56 <zaeph>	I'm glad to be getting a lull on my end.  All things considered, I'm working less than 30h per week, and that's refreshing.
Mar 24 21:59:08 <grobi>	HOLIDAY????
Mar 24 22:00:06 <grobi>	Merkelinchen was on the best way to 'jail' us all
Mar 24 22:00:29 <zaeph>	Yo, I'm on lockdown, don't complain.
Mar 24 22:01:05 <grobi>	you are cursed to stay home?
Mar 24 22:01:20 <zaeph>	…It's complicated.
Mar 24 22:01:26 <zaeph>	We can go out within a 10km radius from our place.
Mar 24 22:01:46 <grobi>	oh
Mar 24 22:02:01 <zaeph>	Non-essential shops are closed, but it doesn't really feel like a lockdown.
Mar 24 22:02:29 <zaeph>	I'm lucky enough that those 10km include pretty good scenery.
Mar 24 22:03:12 <grobi>	actually in a radius of 10km you can walk a lot :D
Mar 24 22:03:38 <zaeph>	Yeah, especially when that includes the entirety of the forest near my place.
Mar 24 22:05:05 <grobi>	buy a very cheap tent! set it down and walk antoher 10 km radius :D
Mar 24 22:05:21 <zaeph>	Coppers won't have it.
Mar 24 22:05:46 <grobi>	of course you need to call it 'my place' before you go
Mar 24 22:06:01 <zaeph>	I also need to have an official document which attest to that.
Mar 24 22:09:00 <grobi>	the most cheap tents come with an official manual
Mar 24 22:12:25 <zaeph>	I'll forward you the tickt.
Mar 24 22:16:51 <grobi>	if the copper is french female and attractive you may send her to me as your 'landlord'
Mar 24 22:17:46 <zaeph>	It'd appeal to your male fantasy, wouldn't it.
Mar 24 22:18:19 <grobi>	wait i need to translate this..
Mar 24 22:18:31 <zaeph>	grobi: It's a meme, don't bother.
Mar 24 22:19:00 <zaeph>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz7tMKlkPOc
Mar 24 22:19:16 <__monty__>	30h/week and 10 of those are "meetings?"
Mar 24 22:19:18 <__monty__>	Dang.
Mar 24 22:19:47 <zaeph>	__monty__ is jelly, __monty__ is jelly!
Mar 24 22:19:57 <__monty__>	Glad I'm not caught up in the corporate world of insanity.
Mar 24 22:20:12 <zaeph>	The money makes this tolerable.
Mar 24 22:20:37 <grobi>	it's call 'breafast-club' __monty__ 
Mar 24 22:20:37 <zaeph>	…And I need to finance my exponentially growing clothing spending habits.
Mar 24 22:21:42 <__monty__>	If you can go for hikes all of those 10 hours it's not too bad.
Mar 24 22:22:47 <zaeph>	Honestly, __monty__, I've gravitated towards those meetings format because they work for me and play to my strengths.  I can see your side and imagine how hellish this could be; but for me, I've found a format that works for me.
Mar 24 22:23:22 <zaeph>	And it keeps me accountable for my other projects, so it's definitely a boon, even though the meetings themselves might not be as efficient as they could be.  Frankly, I welcome the human contact as well.
Mar 24 22:27:49 <__monty__>	What do you get paid for these meetings? There must be serious cash involved to brainwash you into liking meetings 🤔
Mar 24 22:28:22 <zaeph>	Long story short: yes, there is quite a bit of cash involved.
Mar 24 22:42:34 <GermainZ>	I love meetings because I can slack off without feeling guilt \o/
Mar 24 22:43:30 <zaeph>	The same cannot be said for tutoring sessions, though.  I had a 3h continuous session on Monday, and it was a little bit of a marathon.
Mar 24 22:46:06 <GermainZ>	zaeph: what was it about?
Mar 24 22:46:58 <zaeph>	GermainZ: Overall organisation, especially with Emacs.
Mar 24 22:47:06 <GermainZ>	zaeph: tutor me daddy
Mar 24 22:47:23 <zaeph>	GermainZ: I'm out of your paygrade.
Mar 24 22:47:49 <GermainZ>	zaeph: I can afford tree fiddy
Mar 24 22:48:02 <zaeph>	GermainZ: this guy reddits.
Mar 24 22:48:18 <GermainZ>	did that come from reddit?
Mar 24 22:48:20 <zaeph>	Yup.
Mar 24 22:48:28 <zaeph>	Well.
Mar 24 22:48:30 <zaeph>	South Park.
Mar 24 22:48:32 <zaeph>	Then Reddit.
Mar 24 22:48:39 <GermainZ>	South Park is okay
Mar 24 22:48:45 <zaeph>	Reddit is cancer.
Mar 24 22:48:50 <GermainZ>	If it came from Reddit I would've had to retire it from my repertoire
Mar 24 22:49:21 <zaeph>	If I had to remove Reddit memes from my repertoire, I'd be but a stuttering buffoon.
Mar 24 22:49:53 <vifon>	Should we tell him?
Mar 24 22:49:56 <GermainZ>	:D
Mar 24 22:50:08 <zaeph>	Tit.
Mar 24 22:50:21 <zaeph>	I feel so disrespected in here.
Mar 24 22:50:30 <zaeph>	…I guess it keeps me grounded.
Mar 24 22:50:47 <vifon>	Damn right, son, you're grounded.
Mar 24 22:50:55 <zaeph>	but daddy~~
Mar 24 22:51:45 <vifon>	Don't make me spank your sorry ass.

Mar 26 23:11:17 <GermainZ>	vifon: keepassxc doesn't have anything suitable?
Mar 26 23:11:34 <vifon>	No, they handle the challenge-response auth but not U2F.

Mar 26 23:12:40 <x10d>	ok
Mar 26 23:12:40 <vifon>	GermainZ: Does work but I don't want this mode of operation.
Mar 26 23:13:04 <GermainZ>	vifon: a quick google seems to suggest it's not done because it's not the best idea?
Mar 26 23:13:45 <vifon>	Yes, no case of Keepass yes.
Mar 26 23:13:53 <vifon>	But some self-hosted service could do it.
Mar 26 23:14:15 <GermainZ>	ah so you want a password manager that isn't offline?
Mar 26 23:14:25 <vifon>	I'm not convinced yet.
Mar 26 23:14:33 <vifon>	And if I do, it would be inside a VPN.

Mar 26 23:14:43 <vifon>	By my needs. :D
Mar 26 23:14:55 <GermainZ>	So you don't know if you need U2F? :D
Mar 26 23:15:12 <vifon>	I want a 2FA and if I cannot use U2F, why bother? :D
Mar 26 23:15:33 <vifon>	Challenge-Response is not an option because of the first requirement.
Mar 26 23:15:37 <vifon>	> A YubiKey with a spare configuration slot
Mar 26 23:16:15 <GermainZ>	I'm confused TBH :P
Mar 26 23:16:32 <vifon>	OK, back to the start.
Mar 26 23:16:42 <vifon>	I want a 2FA based on my Yubikey.
Mar 26 23:16:51 <vifon>	I have no spare configuration slots on it.
Mar 26 23:17:00 <vifon>	And Challenge-Response needs one.
Mar 26 23:17:18 <vifon>	TOTP is cumbersome.
Mar 26 23:17:25 <GermainZ>	Ah, got it
Mar 26 23:17:51 <GermainZ>	Can't you compile Bitwarden, out of curiosity?
Mar 26 23:17:59 <GermainZ>	Or are the premium parts proprietary?

Mar 27 00:00:02 <vifon>	With Keepass the backup is trivial.
Mar 27 00:00:12 <vifon>	Any kind of risky operation can be mitigated with a cp.
Mar 27 00:00:58 <GermainZ>	and with BW you can't back shit up?
Mar 27 00:02:23 <vifon>	Well, I guess their SQLite db isn't that much different.
Mar 27 00:02:24 <vifon>	I was thinking in terms of Postgres where it's always more of a hassle than just a cp.
Mar 27 00:02:24 <vifon>	But with SQLite it might actually work.
Mar 27 00:02:43 <GermainZ>	Ah

Mar 27 11:32:42 <GermainZ>	I don't see how changing the standard would improve the actual practical issues with RSS, which is that websites either don't use them or use them wrong
Mar 27 11:32:53 <GermainZ>	Unless rss3 comes with tracking and ads for webmasters? :D
Mar 27 11:34:35 <GermainZ>	funnily enough the rumors and info I'm seeing all date back to almost 2 decades
Mar 27 11:39:35 <blawiz>	i dunno, maaybe eg a more limited variant could take over for tweets, which are soooo popular
