Apr 22 12:41:03 <TheWild>	I have some trouble with ddrescue (or just that my CD/DVD reader is buggy). Recovering a CD (1.iso). Well, some sectors couldn't be read at first but were read eventually after some work from ddrescue. Some couldn't be read at all. Eject, clean up, try again with "retry" flag. Done. 100%.

Apr 22 12:41:45 <TheWild>	To be sure, I created new directory and ddrescued again the whole disk from scratch (without mapfile). Again, 100%. Wow!
Apr 22 12:42:09 <TheWild>	now the final test:  cmp -l 1.iso 2.iso

Apr 22 12:43:01 <TheWild>	ddrescue claims in mapfile those sectors were eventually read fine.
Apr 22 12:43:25 <TheWild>	is that ddrescue bug or just something stinks in the CD/DVD reader?
