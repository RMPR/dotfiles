May 18 20:58:19 <FromGitter>	<Hamled> Is there a way that I can get Emacs to open a new frame with either the official banner (if no file is specified) or a single window with the specified file, when I use `emacsclient -c`? With my largely default Spacemacs config, it seems to load a repeat of the window setup from another frame? Or something like that, at least...

Jun 14 09:50:57 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I don't think layers starting with `spacemacs-*` need to be added manually, they are probably loaded by default. ⏎ They might be intended for the Spacemacs base distribution, then one can add Spacemacs features selectively.
Jun 14 10:03:20 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> I did a clean install
Jun 14 10:03:47 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> autocompletion in `SPC f f` and movements in there are still not working like on my other machines. But at least iedit works now
Jun 14 10:04:47 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Is the auto completion issue `cannot split side window...`, it's a known issue.
Jun 14 10:07:11 <FromGitter>	<duianto> If that's your issue, then this seems to be the workaround: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ source: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/7446#issuecomment-417376425 [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5d036446fbcc305cc46aad4d]
Jun 14 10:08:43 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> No. I use `TAB` to autocomplete on my other machines. Here it opens some  and `RET` is the autocompletion. But I think I found the problem
Jun 14 10:09:26 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> Seems like `better-defaults` was also not properly installed. And in my clean install I did not uncomment it. Now it works

Jun 14 15:05:52 <FromGitter>	<tian-yi> @duianto not sure that's the problem, when I do eval `(executable-find "ag")` in my emacs, I get `"/usr/local/bin/ag"`, this means emacs can find `ag` no?
Jun 14 15:07:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Emacs does see it yes.
Jun 14 15:09:45 <FromGitter>	<tian-yi> and in the issues comment you mentioned, I think spacmacs already using `exec-path-from-shell` for osx, I also tried to add this ` (setq-default counsel-ag-base-command "/usr/local/bin/ag --vimgrep --nocolor --nogroup %s")` to `user-init` didn't work :(

Jun 14 20:46:08 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> @patzhang oh nice, it worked, but what is want is delete in vim without overwriting your last yank :(
Jun 14 20:46:17 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @huyhoang8398 There's an open PR that solves that issue: ⏎ osx: add option to separate OSX pasteboard from kill-ring #9344 ⏎ I don't have a mac so I can't test it, and there seems to be an open question to resolve.
Jun 14 20:46:18 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> im reading the link @duianto
Jun 14 20:58:54 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> @duianto well, i tried all but non of these work, so i still looking for  another answer for "way to delete in vim without overwriting your last yank in MacOS", for now i will stick with `SPC r y` from @patzhang  thank you guy
Jun 14 21:43:30 <FromGitter>	<capsulecorplab> Hell spacemacs users, for any orgmode users here, is there a trick to getting deadlines and scheduled tasks to show in agenda view (SPC a o a)?

Jun 16 21:17:00 <FromGitter>	<imgulyas> yea I tried that as well. After a few hours of tryin I got it to work, basically I removed all workspace folders previously seen by metal and then I opened a .scala file in the project and it automagically restarted itself. But I still don't know how to manually start it after a shutdown.

Jul 11 13:40:31 <FromGitter>	<kaaninho> Hello, I got a rather specific question to the `clojure` layer. Hope, I am not totally wrong here.  Suppose I have a working REPL with `cider-jack-in`, if i type a function call like `(my-fun 3  ` the Mini Buffer shows the signature of the function `my-function`, like `namespace/myfun : ([first second third])`. It does -however- not highlight, that its the `second` argument, that I have to supply. I think, in the 
Jul 11 13:40:31 <FromGitter>	... past, There was some highlighting of that. Does any one know of a way to fix this?
Jul 11 14:37:29 <FromGitter>	<samhedin> Is there a way to get syntax highlighting working in org mode src-code blocks with Dockerfiles/docker-compose.yml files? `#+begin_src docker [...] #+end_src` does not seem to do it
Jul 11 15:26:53 <FromGitter>	<nhmacuk> Did someone notice the following problem in org-mode?:  using "<N>" to  limit column width doesn't seem to work in spacemacs developers version 0.300.0 on emacs 26.2 (see column normal column width behaviour on https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-width-and-alignment.html). Haven't been able to find an issue about it yet. If more people have this problem I shall raise the issue.
Jul 11 15:57:39 <FromGitter>	<DuncanBetts> If I want to install some package like http://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/#org793bea5 do I follow the normal installation instructions, or create a layer?
Jul 11 15:59:01 <FromGitter>	<DuncanBetts> I suppose my question should be, can I just follow the normal procedure. And now I've asked it, I've realized I should just try.

Oct 11 16:13:24 <FromGitter>	<TK997> @duianto so as you can see on pictures
Oct 11 16:13:33 <FromGitter>	<TK997> one line has 16 chars, the other has 4 chars
Oct 11 16:13:54 <FromGitter>	<TK997> I tried using indent but no use... I always come to 16 chars
Oct 11 16:14:01 <FromGitter>	<TK997> the rest of the lines all have 4 chars
Oct 11 16:15:50 <FromGitter>	<TK997> how can I fix that? I thought maybe adding something in  ⏎ .spacemacs ?
Oct 11 16:16:04 <FromGitter>	<TK997> I enabled the python layer for spacemacs tho
Oct 11 16:17:21 <mroh>	try "C-x h" "M-C-\"

Oct 11 16:20:26 <FromGitter>	<TK997> So I found out that my Tab is jump up for 4 orange dots
Oct 11 16:20:35 <FromGitter>	<TK997> it's practically same as me hitting space
Oct 11 16:20:44 <FromGitter>	<TK997> how do I fix that?
Oct 11 16:23:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Maybe there's a simpler method, but I guess you could select a tab (one set of double arrows) or four spaces, and use iedit `SPC s e` to edit all of them so that they use the same type of indentation.
Oct 11 16:25:42 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Tab is set to toggle the current iedit occurrence (at least on the `develop` branch), so you'll have to press `C-q TAB` to insert a tab.
Oct 11 16:25:45 <FromGitter>	<TK997> don't know how to use the above mentioned

Oct 18 16:17:32 <mrig>	Do you guys use ag or grep in your spacmacs setups?
Oct 18 16:18:03 <mrig>	MarconSantana, not yet but I will be looking into it.
Oct 18 16:18:49 <FromGitter>	<MarcoSantana> @FromIRC Yes ag
Oct 18 16:19:40 <mrig>	I was wondering what the advantages of it are over grep, I see that you can open the list of results as if it were file, is this specific to ag?
Oct 18 16:22:21 <mrig>	Do I need to change the order of the list in my .spacemacs file to get ag to override grep?
Oct 18 16:23:33 <mrig>	or is this to be installed on the os perhaps?
Oct 18 16:24:30 <mrig>	ohhhh the silver searcher :O
Oct 18 16:25:33 <mrig>	:D love this stuff <3
Oct 18 16:32:17 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i was using ack, but moved to ag recently and its good
Oct 18 16:32:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> considering ripgrep too
Oct 18 16:32:52 <mrig>	nice to be able to edit the result set in a transient state buffer, pretty slick.
Oct 18 16:33:00 <mrig>	Very fast too.
Oct 18 16:33:08 <mrig>	how is ripgrep?
Oct 18 16:33:16 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> supposed to be the fastest
Oct 18 16:33:19 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> built in rust
Oct 18 16:33:26 <mrig>	ah ok.
Oct 18 16:33:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i haven't used it yet, i think the integration with spacemacs was relatively new last time i was looking.  but it has been a while since then
Oct 18 16:34:00 <mrig>	Yes makes sense, I see that ag is written in c, so lightning fast.
Oct 18 16:34:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> yeah ag was the fastest i was aware of before ripgrep (rg)
Oct 18 16:34:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i switched to ag when working on some very large projects
Oct 18 16:34:44 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> helps with the `SPC /` searching
Oct 18 16:34:46 <mrig>	grep is amazing code though, amazing history.
Oct 18 16:35:21 <mrig>	just learning about iedit, that is very nice too.
Oct 18 16:35:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i never knew much about it.  i went into Emacs world early on in my CLI days and was always looking for an Emacs solution to things
Oct 18 16:35:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> my usual use of grep is `ps aux | grep foo`
Oct 18 16:35:56 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> or `apt search | grep foo`
Oct 18 16:36:01 <mrig>	Oh yes Spc / is way faster.
Oct 18 16:36:25 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> still haven't ever used iedit
Oct 18 16:36:28 <mrig>	I use it alot in the terminal yes.
Oct 18 16:36:48 <mrig>	seems nice for selective refactoring, function by function.
Oct 18 16:40:28 <FromGitter>	<apj68> BTW, if anyone has time for a stackexchange contribution, I posted a "how do I do evil-mc" question (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53212/how-can-i-use-evil-mc-in-spacemacs).
Oct 18 16:41:51 <FromGitter>	<apj68> I've done a bit with `iedit`, it's pretty cool and seems like a good compliment to `evil-mc` hence I'm trying to figure it out
Oct 18 16:42:04 <FromGitter>	<apj68> (`evil-mc`, that is)
Oct 18 16:45:39 <FromGitter>	<apj68> @brorbw , try `SPC`-`ve` then begin your edit.  Optionally, after `v` you could alter the scope before starting your edit.
Oct 18 17:02:12 <mrig>	sorry has to be done : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOrpFeXUao&app=desktop

Oct 20 00:30:02 <FromGitter>	<zjp> (if (package-installed-p 'ein) [duplicated code]) doesn't feel right

Oct 20 16:22:26 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> how can I find out which variables I can set on a layer?
Oct 20 16:36:21 <enikar>	reading the layer document can help a lot. In the spacemacs home buffer, select `[Search in spacemacs]', then select the layer of your choice.
Oct 20 16:37:03 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> thank you!
Oct 20 16:38:07 <mroh>	also, source helps: the layers variables are in the config.el file of the layer
Oct 20 16:39:20 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> ah I see! I dont know much about elisp, but its not too hard to figure out though :)
Oct 20 16:40:24 <FromGitter>	<Compro-Prasad> Just like Emacs is better vim than vim, its also better Google than Google.
Oct 20 16:40:56 <mroh>	hehe, for emacs stuff, for sure ^^
Oct 20 16:41:18 <enikar>	before, I can select the documentation's layer with `SPC d l` or something like that. It doesn't work any more… `SPC d` shows me only one binding with b for browse-docs-online-at-point.
Oct 20 16:42:31 <enikar>	It seems to be an issue… For the moment I use emacs without spacemacs, I didn't notice that.
Oct 20 16:45:09 <enikar>	never mind. I was wrong, this `SPC h l` to access documentation layers.
Oct 20 16:51:23 <FromGitter>	<MinallWch> Hello spacemacs!

Oct 20 21:50:52 <FromGitter>	<MintStudios> @duianto Installation is succesful. Where would I install the Source Code Pro font?
Oct 20 21:56:54 <FromGitter>	<MintStudios> or anyone else
Oct 20 21:57:58 <FromGitter>	<duianto> It's just a standard windows font installation. You download the fonts: ⏎ `source-code-pro-2.030R-ro-1.050R-it.zip` from here: ⏎ https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/2.030R-ro%2F1.050R-it ⏎  ⏎ And extract the files temporarily. I think I used the `ttf` files, you can probably select all .ttf font files, right click and choose install. [https://g
Oct 20 21:57:58 <FromGitter>	... itter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5dacca690fdc4b65072320b3]
Oct 20 22:00:06 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Yes, I've got the `ttf` files installed. Windows might support some or even all of the other formats but at least the `ttf` files do work.
Oct 20 22:01:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> When the fonts are installed then you can delete the extracted directory, the font's have been installed somewhere else. Probably in a windows directory.

Jan 02 17:19:56 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` https://i.imgur.com/sbw4FbI.png
Jan 02 17:31:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> qurqar - what are you seeing at startup?  there's also `dotspacemacs-maximized-at-startup` variable that could be affecting it
Jan 02 17:32:50 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` It opens maximized, let me see
Jan 02 17:35:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: The position and size also changes for me with that command in PopOS 19.10.
Jan 02 17:37:06 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` ok the maximized was set, now the code works but I also need to use this on Windows and different screen sizes. Is it posible to work with percentages instead of pixels?
Jan 02 17:43:46 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri I'll make that little fix. How about I also add a function to find the current channels log file, that is, for easier switching to log file?

Jan 02 17:46:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> sounds great :) i keep meaning to use ERC more ... unfortunately i spend most of my time in slack xP @mphojele
Jan 02 17:50:01 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` duianto (Gitter): thanks, except that I know donkey poop about how to set all that, just started using emacs :(
Jan 02 17:50:16 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` I am at the copy paste stage yet

[https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e1f7929e8167dcf73e756]
Jan 02 17:52:01 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I'm going afk for a little bit, but if someone else hasn't found an answer, then I can take a look.
Jan 02 17:52:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri slack is a irc client?
Jan 02 17:53:22 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` duianto (Gitter):  thanks, just looking for a code snippet that can keep teh rough size of the preset emacs window size across devices
Jan 02 17:53:40 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> slack is not an irc client afaik.  its just bloated electron chat app that i have to use at work
Jan 02 17:54:11 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` the previous snippet is good for a single monitor but I am sharing .spacemacs across 4 devices , that would drive one crazy on different devices
Jan 02 18:10:51 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> so the erc layer has these mode bindings: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ Any suggestions on the key I could use for the function that finds the current channels log file? [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e241b0fd3413f4c961c20]
Jan 02 19:30:33 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar, If a difference between the devices can be detected, then you can have specific positions and sizes for each device.
Jan 02 19:35:52 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @mphojele - I'd say either `"v"` for view channel logs or maybe `"c"` for "current channel logs"  ?
Jan 02 19:57:13 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri  I was thinking `"L"` since I believe it'll be less used and you wouldn't want to easily opening the log file by mistake
Jan 02 19:59:37 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> 👍 also good. i forget about the caps sometimes :)
Jan 02 20:02:33 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> you forget that bindings can be uppercase or you forget to type commands that are uppercase?
Jan 02 20:04:16 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> both
Jan 02 20:04:23 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i don't like pressing shift xD
Jan 02 20:08:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Yeah! I also forget type uppercase sometimes. I'm putting the command on `"c"`, if somebody feels it's unconventional they'll motivate why because we got our on back up story now. So the code is working as intended...
Jan 02 20:09:35 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Now it's the hard part left... Figuring out a intuitive commit message...
Jan 02 20:10:29 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> it is such a challenge sometimes. only 80c!
Jan 02 20:13:14 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Especially, when like me, you always have a lot to say and different ways of saying it
Jan 02 20:33:07 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` > <@gitter_duianto:matrix.org> qurqar, If a difference between the devices can be detected, then you can have specific positions and sizes for each device. ⏎  ⏎ I am sure it is possible, but I know jackshieet about lisp and emacs in general
Jan 02 20:35:58 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: Here are two possible methods for detecting the primary monitor size or the OS. ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e461e2640a676295a0e73]
Jan 02 20:36:56 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> And there is the (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/13147)[fix]
Jan 02 20:37:16 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: The `(message ...` lines (except the last parenthesis can be replaced modify-frame-parameters command.
Jan 02 20:38:28 <FromGitter>	<duianto> There I added the closing parenthesis after the messages line, now it's easier to replace the messages line with the modify-frame parameters command.
Jan 02 20:38:36 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar`
Jan 02 20:39:00 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Although it might also work to use these commands in stead: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ to set the Emacs frame position and size. [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e46d4e10e9a722544a2ef]
Jan 02 20:39:38 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The `t` at the end of frame size means that the numbers are specified in pixels.
Jan 02 20:39:52 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The position doesn't need a t, it's probably in pixels by default
Jan 02 20:40:22 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Yes, it's in pixels.
Jan 02 20:43:34 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` thanks I will paly around with these
Jan 02 20:44:06 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` also you recommended to put in the user-init block, is there a separate file that I can edit instead, to keep things nice and neay
Jan 02 20:44:12 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar`  * also you recommended to put in the user-init block, is there a separate file that I can edit instead, to keep things nice and neat
Jan 02 20:46:22 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I haven't loaded an external file from my `.spacemacs` but it seems like that should work. Maybe someone else in here knows how to do it?
Jan 02 20:49:21 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: This sounds like what your looking for: ⏎ http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/organize_your_dot_emacs.html
Jan 02 20:50:08 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The tutorial is referring to the default Emacs `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file, but it should work fine with the Spacemacs `~/.spacemacs` file.
Jan 02 22:17:00 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> 💡 You know what would be great? if we added a way to alternate between the windows transient state (`SPC w .`) and the navigation transient state (`SPC N`). Awesome right?! I know.
Jan 02 22:19:17 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> like a key in each transient to switch to the other?
Jan 02 22:19:27 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i didn't even know about those states xD
Jan 02 22:24:38 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Yes. The cool thing here is that theses transient states work persisently, meaning running any command within the state keeps you in the state unless you explicitly quit the state with `q` usually.
Jan 02 22:26:57 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The Layouts Transient State `SPC l` (lowercase L) has `w` for switching to the Workspaces Transient State, which in turn has `l` (lowercase L) for switching back. So there's a precedence for that kind of behavior.
Jan 02 22:35:08 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @duianto oh yes, so I'll find out how they implemented that, and hopefully replicate it. Actually, another 💡 turned on...
Jan 02 22:35:15 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> 😆
Jan 02 22:37:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> How about change all these states? Meaning you can move from Layouts, Workspaces, Windows and Navigation states in web form. Each one is accessible from the other...
Jan 02 22:39:46 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> sounds like One Transient To Rule Them All
Jan 02 22:48:33 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> I think I'm too bored 🤦 😆 Anyways, I'm going to head on and knit this web

Jan 22 10:39:27 <FromGitter>	<vipenzo> @duianto Thanks very much. As a general question: how to you map documentation for emacs to spacemacs ? I mean, I found this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FrameSize explaining how to set frame geometry in "initial-frame-alist" option but I wasn't able to find it in the spacemacs configurationd docs. Are they separate worlds ?
Jan 22 10:42:26 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Hi all,  how would I go about refreshing the magit buffer when I focus the window again? I tried doing it like this: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ but when I open magit it is a blank buffer.  ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e28191a42ae383fa967bcbb]
Jan 22 11:29:01 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @vipenzo Spacemacs is Emacs with configurations.
Jan 22 11:30:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @TotNotTac `g r` calls `magit-refresh`
Jan 22 11:31:55 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Or you probably ment automatically using elisp.
Jan 22 11:45:33 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yes
Jan 22 11:46:20 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> There's no hook for window switching right?
Jan 22 11:50:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Test with `advice-add`, this quick test seems to work: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e28290c258edf397bc8b458]
Jan 22 11:50:54 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The last line is just if you want to remove the advice while testing.
Jan 22 11:59:53 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Hmm the advice works, and the function runs but it seems to mess up when magit-refresh runs
Jan 22 12:04:27 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I saw this comment that states that `select-window` can run potentially thousands of times in a single command: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20936510 ⏎ The suggestion there is to use `post-command-hook` instead.
Jan 22 12:06:07 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I added a counter to the scratch-msg and by just opening the `SPC` which-key popup it counts to 38.
Jan 22 12:10:44 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> 😱
Jan 22 12:10:46 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yeah I dont want that
Jan 22 12:16:58 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yeah it ran 34 times for me  as well
Jan 22 12:19:03 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> But post-command-hook makes it run every time you do anything :p
Jan 22 12:19:10 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> for example, move your cursor
Jan 22 12:19:36 <FromGitter>	<duianto> yeah that sounds worse.
Jan 22 12:23:49 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> I can try to use select-window again to store the last active major mode and only run magit-refresh if the mode is something else than a magit related mode

Jan 22 16:32:32 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> DuClare - i'm not sure there is one by default... if you use vanilla bindings you can do `C-u -1 M-u` but thats not much better.  `M-b M-u` will do it too, so I'd suggest defining your own function to be a combo of the commands needed to do the upcasing

Feb 19 12:43:23 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @maciej-bendkowski just for the record - I would not use treemacs to pick a single file. I usually use it if I want to see the structure of the project. If you want to open a I file I would use SPC p f/SPC p r
Feb 19 12:43:52 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> and sometimes vinegar layer
Feb 19 13:24:05 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @maciej-bendkowski I was suggesting using Layouts instead of Treemacs, as it seemed you only used it to switch between projects.  As mentioned above, the `SPC p f` is very useful and I find it more effective.  Layouts keep project views isolated.
Feb 19 13:25:37 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I don't find Treemacs or Neotree that useful.  I occasionally use ranger, `SPC a r`, to browse through projects, as it is fast and has a file preview.
Feb 19 13:26:38 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> You can also do some amazing things with helm.

Feb 29 15:58:47 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @Martinsos sorry, I didn't find it clear why you want to run Emacs in a terminal.  It is just because you are doing Git on the command line? You can configure `.spacemacs` to run a persistent server, there is specific entries for this already.  You can configure `.gitconfig` to use `emacsclient` as it's editor, so if you don't specify a message, then `emacsclient` will be used to open a buffer in Emacs instantly.  
Feb 29 15:58:47 <FromGitter>	... If it's only for got, you could instead use Magit.  Add the `git` layer to `.spacemacs` and use `SPC g s` to open git status, from where you can stage, commit, pull, push, etc.
Feb 29 16:01:16 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I always have Emacs running, so it never takes any time to start.
Feb 29 16:37:51 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> Thanks all -> it is normally for some quick git stuff (I still find it easier to do it from terminal than magit) or to edit some file real quickly if I am already at it in terminal. ⏎ Ok, so you are all suggesting doing it via daemon -> I will try that more than, I was having issues with it but I am sure there is a way to get it working properly. Thanks!
Feb 29 16:39:01 <FromGitter>	<mitchell-horning> @mitchell-horning Mischief manage, my question was answered in the lispy readme. There is a larger problem that where lispy-mode's map is lower in precedence than evil's, so evil has quashed some important keybindings. I will likely manually remap, but a way to specify minor mode keymap precedence might be nice
Feb 29 16:48:55 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> @ANGkeith I did as you said, and daemon is running, however I get following behaviour: emacsclient -nw is still doing some loading (snippets and some stuff), so I still have to wait couple of seconds until I can start using spacemacs. I tried opening another emacsclient -nw at the same time, and that one turned on immediatelly. However, when I tried to close that second one, it also closed the first one! Each 
Feb 29 16:48:55 <FromGitter>	... those was in different terminal. So I am not sure what is the benefit of daemon if it behaves like this hm! Or maybe they are not really using daemon? I checked with `ps` and I see daemon running. ⏎ Here is my service file (it came with emacs installation, I am on arch, emacs version 26.3 . ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link` ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e5a87e7ca2f5a558d5942e3]
Feb 29 16:53:13 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> I can't even stop the daemon, I tried running `systemctl stop --user emacs` and now there is process `emacsclient --eval (kill-emacs)` that is just stuck.
Feb 29 16:53:44 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> actually it seems it killed it now, after 2 minutes
Feb 29 17:21:53 <FromGitter>	<aeschylus> Hi All.

Feb 29 17:27:14 <FromGitter>	<nixmaniack> @aeschylus You can add that in your `~/.spacemacs` file in the `dotspacemacs/user-config` section/function.
Feb 29 17:30:55 <FromGitter>	<aeschylus> @nixmaniack Gracias!
Feb 29 18:03:15 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> How can I remap Helm's mini buffer help menu ```C-c ?``` to ```C-c m```? The default ```C-c ?``` does not work on my language/keyboard. The mapped function is ```helm-help```. You can see a list of all functions by pressing ```C-c```inside a helm mini buffer and then wait for menu to pop up.

Mar 02 14:34:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Wilk, yes that seems like the problem. Emacs 26.1 deprecated when-let, seems like the Vue layer is still using it?
Mar 02 14:45:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Maybe it's somewhere else. I have only been on my phone and haven't been able to look closely at what is calling it
Mar 02 14:58:18 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Wilk - what version of spacemacs are you using?
Mar 02 15:06:49 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i'm not sure, oddly, when-let is still defined for me, and the place in spacemacs that looks like it is calling `when-let` for you is actually written as `when-let*`
Mar 02 15:09:38 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> maybe you need to recompile some of the code
Mar 02 16:14:22 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> Is there a way to figure out which commit hash my spacemacs is using? If I do `SPC f e v` I just get 0.300.0, but I'd like to know that the emacs that I'm opening is on the latest.  Sometimes I can't tell when using `emacsclient`

Mar 18 14:30:22 <FromGitter>	<nixmaniack> @Cassiel-girl There are ways in which you can get it working but it's the terminal that you'd need to configure. Currently, there's no standard keycode defined for sending `C-<ret>` to app running inside terminal, hence emacs can't do much about that. What you can do is, rebind those functions for something which gets recognized inside terminal emacs.

Mar 19 14:47:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Hi guys! Is it right that from the init-function in the `packages.el` of a layer, I can only run function defined in `funcs.el`?
Mar 19 14:49:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> It seems I can not call (lsp) directly from there, but I can put it in a function in `funcs.el` and then call that funtion from the init-function in `packages.el`

Mar 19 14:51:19 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Here indeed it says funcs.el that all function used by the layer should be declared there... but I do not know what means "all" here... I would expect that I can just call any available function

Mar 19 15:56:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl Does it have something to do with the warning in section 12.11.2 here (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html)?
Mar 19 16:02:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook nil t
Mar 19 16:04:17 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Setting-Hooks.html
Mar 19 16:05:45 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @dalanicolai_gitlab - you need to be careful about calling functions from other packages in your layer. i don't know the context, but it could be that `lsp` is not loaded where you're trying to call it?
Mar 19 16:06:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I put it in a   (if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)
Mar 19 16:07:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> And when it tries to run (lsp) but it gives some error message
Mar 19 16:08:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> huh... maybe also needs a `with-eval-after-load`?
Mar 19 16:09:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Actually I tried to get the error message now
Mar 19 16:10:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I did not use this
Mar 19 16:10:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> And now it works
Mar 19 16:10:25 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> is this after interacting with lsp in your current emacs session?
Mar 19 16:11:09 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> No fresh restart
Mar 19 16:11:26 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :shrug:
Mar 19 16:11:33 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> magic
Mar 19 16:11:35 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :P
Mar 19 16:11:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Now I put in this again and the error is back
Mar 19 16:11:58 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> (if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)
Mar 19 16:12:59 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Took it out again, restarted and again it works
Mar 19 16:16:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Put it in again the error is back
Mar 19 16:16:30 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738cd1a2e37e3a0346d143]
Mar 19 16:17:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Anyway... this answered my question... so I can call just (lsp) from here
Mar 19 16:17:52 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I prefer to check for the layer of course
Mar 19 16:19:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So when I put the  ⏎  ⏎ ```'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp) ⏎                                   (lsp))``` ⏎  ⏎ part in a different function in funcs.el and then call that from the :init here then it works [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738d6b0f0687340b4123f4]
Mar 19 16:21:02 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> must be some arcane load order thing going on
Mar 19 16:21:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So it gives `file mode specification error: (invalid-function (lsp))`
Mar 19 16:21:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I really don't get it
Mar 19 16:21:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But anyway... I know how to avoid it
Mar 19 16:21:58 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> so the `if` in the `use-package` does not work, but in the `funcs.el` wrapped in a function it does?
Mar 19 16:22:27 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Yes
Mar 19 16:22:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Well in the use-package it also tries to call (lsp)
Mar 19 16:23:01 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> but then it gives an error
Mar 19 16:23:06 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @dalanicolai_gitlab how do you reffer lsp-mode package?
Mar 19 16:23:17 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> You probably have deleted the autoloads file
Mar 19 16:23:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I just updated my spacemacs packages
Mar 19 16:23:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Don't think I deleted anything
Mar 19 16:24:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> lsp-mode is just installed via the lsp-layer
Mar 19 16:24:23 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> you did PR in lsp-mode package - how do you load it?
Mar 19 16:24:34 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I don't load that one anymore
Mar 19 16:24:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I just updated the packages from melpa
Mar 19 16:24:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> just the lsp layer
Mar 19 16:25:11 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> because `lsp` function is autoloaded -  this means that you should be able to call (lsp) without requiring lsp-mode.el
Mar 19 16:25:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I can indeed
Mar 19 16:25:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But not in this way
Mar 19 16:26:18 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But when I create a function with only this in there ⏎  ⏎ ```'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)           (lsp))``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738f1d671a621fe09dd128]
Mar 19 16:28:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I removed everything from my spacemacs file to load the lsp-mode in some other way
Mar 19 16:30:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So when I remove that `'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)` then it just works
Mar 19 16:30:25 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> from the use-package
Mar 19 16:32:57 <FromGitter>	<anddam> while using neotree and projectile is there a way to set a project's root?
Mar 19 16:33:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> put a .projectile file in the root folder
Mar 19 16:33:19 <FromGitter>	<anddam> I am manually creating a .projectile file since I could not find a way to tell any of those "this is a project root"
Mar 19 16:33:23 <FromGitter>	<anddam> ok
Mar 19 16:34:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Yes fine... or initiate some version control in that directory

Mar 19 16:37:15 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> who can help me?
Mar 19 16:37:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Hi I answered you half an hour ago or so
Mar 19 16:37:49 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Just look a little up
Mar 19 16:38:29 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl it is not a straight answer
Mar 19 16:39:05 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl found it?
Mar 19 16:45:42 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> Could you make a detailed explain?
Mar 19 16:45:49 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I can't understand it.
Mar 19 16:45:51 <FromGitter>	<anddam> @dalanicolai_gitlab I have a project root with multiple repos in it
Mar 19 16:46:12 <FromGitter>	<anddam> well I figure I still should put the main repo under revision control…
Mar 19 16:46:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl Haha, me neither...
Mar 19 16:46:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I will try
Mar 19 16:47:50 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @anddam I don't know much about projectile yet
Mar 19 16:48:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But do you want a project for the LSP?
Mar 19 16:50:18 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Hi, I just encountered a strange problem: whenever I type a "^", it does not type the symbol but waits for another input. If I then type a "2", it creates a little "squared" symbol, if I type a space " ", it will create a "^" symbol in the text. I'm using spacemacs, evil mode with auctex. I don't even know how to call this problem to properly search for it :-D
Mar 19 16:51:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @anddam You can not find the answer here (https://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/#adding-custom-project-types)?
Mar 19 16:52:04 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> I also don't even know if this is a feature of vim, emacs, spacemacs, auctex....
Mar 19 16:53:20 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi my guess is auxtex
Mar 19 16:54:28 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Ah, interesting, I just tested it in an empty non-tex buffer and the problem is the same.
Mar 19 16:54:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl It is not completely clear to me what you want...
Mar 19 16:55:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Ah... okay
Mar 19 16:55:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> wait
Mar 19 16:56:34 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - oh really... if you `SPC h d m` it will tell you all the modes that are active... it will be a lot but it doesn't happen for me normally

Mar 19 17:01:03 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi you could also try `SPC h d k ^` and see if it tells you what its doing
Mar 19 17:01:15 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - are you trying to define your own layer?
Mar 19 17:01:37 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I want to add a hook to  c++-mode and company mode. The hook changes the company-backends.
Mar 19 17:02:02 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> A.. I see `company-keywords` needs an argument
Mar 19 17:02:40 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Here are minor modes I could imagine cause this by the description: Transient-mark, Auto-Composition, spacemacs-leader-override-mode, eval-sexp-fu-flash
Mar 19 17:02:44 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Do any ring a bell?
Mar 19 17:03:07 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @dalanicolai_gitlab your code not work.
Mar 19 17:03:27 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri I tried this and it again does not register the key. Only once i press "^" and then " " it even displays something

Mar 19 17:04:12 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - could be an Evil thing i guess, I don't use evil so i don't know. does it happen in the `*scratch*` buffer?
Mar 19 17:04:38 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl the recommended way to set your c-c++ backend is with a layer variable.  are you on `master` or `develop` branch?
Mar 19 17:04:43 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri yep, even in the scratch
Mar 19 17:04:48 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> `(c-c++ :variables c-c++-backend 'lsp-clangd)`
Mar 19 17:05:40 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @dalanicolai_gitlab It seems a problem of spacemacs add hook to special mode.
Mar 19 17:06:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl I think grant knows more about this then me
Mar 19 17:07:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Haha... I think spacemacs should be able enough for that
Mar 19 17:08:14 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri I fixed it. It was a problem with the X server and WSL on windows. Thank you for your help.
Mar 19 17:08:39 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :P lol
Mar 19 17:09:38 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Once it was clear to me that no strange editing mode like this exists within spacemacs, the culprit was quickly found!
Mar 19 17:09:56 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - according to the documentation on the `develop` branch, the recommended way to configure C++ is with the LSP backend, which also works for completion (company)
Mar 19 17:10:20 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> it might be that what you're running into is two conflicting pieces of code are setting your company backends
Mar 19 17:10:52 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - you *could* have behavior like that in Emacs, but it should only exist in modes with like... math symbol inputs
Mar 19 17:17:49 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> brrrr, I'm glad I don't have to work in such modes ;-)
Mar 19 17:17:59 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @rommeswi Yeah, I am on the newest develop branch. And I am configuring my own layer.
Mar 19 17:19:12 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I do  not use official c-c++ layer.  And I want to find the problem and make my layer work.
Mar 19 17:22:39 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @Cassiel-girl Sorry, I don't think you pinged the right person :-)
Mar 19 17:25:42 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl  anyway... I think you are at least forgetting to quote the lambda

Mar 19 17:54:44 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - it looks like the `company-backends` variable automatically becomes buffer local when set. the global value of the variable for me is `nil` but depending on what buffer i'm in, it gets set

Mar 20 15:18:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> looks like maybe more than one way to do it, but you can switch to different input modes with `C-\` - I'm sure you can find one that works :)
Mar 20 15:23:09 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @paxsali - yeah looks like nothing "official" for documentation aside from the directive tags. i haven't seen many examples with additional comments, but i'm sure they're out there
Mar 20 15:30:25 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> How does one tell yasnippet not to create a newline when you're trying to expand something in the middle of the sentence? E.g. you type ```Hello keytrigger World!". Suppose ```keytrigger``` is a key that can be expanded into ```${1:my} ${2:very} ${3:beautiful}```. When you go to the end of ```keytrigger``` and press ```C-p``` for expand, it actually breaks everything into two lines: Lineno 1: ```Hello my very 
Mar 20 15:30:26 <FromGitter>	... beautiful``` and Lineno 2: ```World!```.
Mar 20 15:31:33 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> Obviously my snippet itself doesn't have multiple lines.

Apr 02 09:51:16 <dokma>	yyoncho: but C-a C-k does not work either
Apr 02 09:51:52 <dokma>	yyoncho: for now I use 0 SPC /
Apr 02 09:52:12 <dokma>	yyoncho: because I usually do not have anything on the first column of code.
Apr 02 09:53:06 <dokma>	yyoncho: SPC / runs the command spacemacs/helm-project-smart-do-search
Apr 02 09:54:42 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> did you try to install silversearcher?
Apr 02 09:59:06 <FromGitter>	<anddam> wow this IRC bridge is awkward
Apr 02 10:00:46 <FromGitter>	<anddam> I am in a folder myroot/ that has a .git subfolder, there is myroot/mysrc/ that is an hg repo therefore has myroot/mysrc/.hg
Apr 02 10:01:22 <FromGitter>	<lanigb> Hi, following the advice of jr0cket , I installed emacs-snapshot. Each time I launch it I got the message  "Update your dotfile (SPC f e D) and packages after every update". I am ok with that apart from the fact that I have no idea of what should go into this update. How can I get rid of this message ? TIA.
Apr 02 10:02:13 <FromGitter>	<anddam> if I open projectile it selects as root myroot/, but when I use spacemacs/search-project-auto the tool used (ag) skips mysrc/
Apr 02 10:02:41 <FromGitter>	<anddam> I figure this is due to some ignore rules but what could it be considering ag's configuration *does not* skip mysrc when used from CLI?
Apr 02 10:04:05 <FromGitter>	<anddam> and, separate question, even if I browse the project tree and change the root using `R`, then when I hit `SPC 0` or close and reopen the projectile window, then the displayed root is myroot/ again, how do I change root and have that set in stone?
Apr 02 10:08:39 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @lanigb if yo do not have any customisation in your original .Spacemacs file, then simply move or delete it.
Apr 02 10:09:26 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Otherwise just accept all the changes from the spacemacs.templte file unless you know there is something you want to keep
Apr 02 10:10:37 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Once your .spacemacs file has all the configuration options from the template then the message will stop.
Apr 02 10:16:19 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> <dokma> I stopped using `SPC /` and use `SPC s p` for helm-swoop search.  I find this much easier to use (and close).
Apr 02 10:22:22 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @kaaninho I believe the mini buffer is eldoc, rather than auto-complete (I could be wrong).  I am not sure I understand the issue.
Apr 02 10:39:58 <FromGitter>	<lanigb> @jr0cket
Apr 02 10:41:02 <FromGitter>	<lanigb> @jr0cket >Otherwise just accept all the changes from the spacemacs.template file  ⏎ Sorry for the dumb question but what is the procees to accept changes ?
Apr 02 10:44:36 <dokma>	jr0cket: I can't clear the prefilled patern in SPC s p either
Apr 02 10:45:46 <dokma>	jr0cket, yyoncho: just stumbled upon a key combination that clears the prefilled patern: C-a C-Del
Apr 02 10:46:15 <dokma>	jr0cket, yyoncho: WHOA... just improved it... C-Backspace clears it from the end
Apr 02 10:46:39 <dokma>	jr0cket, yyoncho: where do these unnatural bindings come from?
Apr 02 10:54:33 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> `C-` and `M-` keybinding are classic Emacs. For example `C-y` pastes the current keyring into prompts (e.g helm).  `C-h` navigates to a parent directory in helm (e.g find-file, buffer-list)
Apr 02 11:00:44 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @lanigb  `?` in the diff window shows the commands.  Use `n` to jump to to each diff, `b` to copy it's change into the a buffer (spacemacs.template is usually the b buffer).  You can also just make your own edits.  Make sure you have all the configuration sections (ideally any updated docs too).  You cannot course use different values
Apr 02 11:11:49 <dokma>	jr0cket: is there any way to list all the keybindings available in helm?
Apr 02 11:17:16 <agnem>	Hi, does anyone have any idea why lsp-lens'es are added to  my buffer when I save with `:w`?
Apr 02 11:31:15 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> <dokma> helm keybindings are in the docs https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+completion/helm/README.html#key-bindings
Apr 02 11:33:50 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> <dokma> you know this `SPC ?`
Apr 02 11:42:33 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @chama-chomo `SPC ?` seems useful for listing everything in the current major mode, is that correct? ⏎ I use `SPC h d f` to describe functions and `SPC h k` to describe keys.  On occasion I have also added the command-log layer and run that whist working, as a useful way to see what commands are being used.
Apr 02 11:46:09 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> yes, but you might find it useful if you don't know it
Apr 02 11:49:36 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Is there a way to show just the helm keybindings?  It seems you cannot call `SPC ?` when you have helm pop-up open and just list those keys.  Does `SPC ?` include the helm keybindings as well (it seems to be a long list), so useful to browse or if you know roughly what you are looking for.  Thanks.
Apr 02 11:52:01 <FromGitter>	<lanigb> @jr0cket Thanks.
Apr 02 11:53:03 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> My pleasure, you question has helped me improve the documentation (which I have just updated with the same details)
Apr 02 11:53:23 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> i have one question too, I'm using automatic parens closing, so if i type something like this `def restore_archive(|)` the cursor stays inside the brackets, is there any option to set up that after hitting `TAB` it would place the cursor after the brackets instead of indenting the code?
Apr 02 11:55:30 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> without escaping insert mode ofc
Apr 02 11:57:15 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @chama-chomo not quite the same, but you can use `)` to jump to after the brackets.  This is controlled by the `dotspacemacs-smart-closing-parenthesis` option in .spacemacs, which you will need to set to `t` for true.
Apr 02 11:58:18 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> yes, i know it, but i find it quite complicated to press
Apr 02 11:59:52 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> what i do now is `ESC SHIFT a`
Apr 02 12:00:50 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> it seems to be bound to `spacemacs/smart-closing-parenthesis` so you could create your own binding, but be careful you don't over-ride anything important :)
Apr 02 12:01:09 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> ok thx
Apr 02 12:01:46 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Snippets are very useful, I use them for things like `def` `defn` in Clojure and tab through the different sections
Apr 02 12:02:37 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I include snippets in the auto-completion popups to make them really easy to use https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/snippets/
Apr 02 12:06:04 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> i have this option enabled too, but now snippets appear

Apr 12 00:26:35 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> When you quit the ediff buffer, then it should automatically take you back to the buffer you started at and be in its major mode.  There can only be one major mode, but lots of minor ones.

Apr 12 14:51:55 <FromGitter>	<bratan05> Hi there! I'm trying to install spacemacs develop branch on a freshly built emacs 28. The problem is I get mutliple "Package *** is unavailable. Is the package name misspelled?" error. However, when I turn on my company's VPN the error mysteriously goes away. Do you guys know what the hell is going on with that?

Apr 12 16:30:35 <FromGitter>	<kindaro> I read this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16048231/ — but I do not understand it.
Apr 12 16:30:56 <FromGitter>	<kindaro> Essentially it says that I must define a global minor mode instead.

Apr 12 20:41:47 <FromGitter>	<mivade> I'm trying to get Spacemacs installed so I can try it out but I'm running into messages like "Package undo-tree is unavailable." This seems related to #12535, but the solution there doesn't work for me. This makes things entirely unusable because nothing seems to get past this. Any ideas?
Apr 12 20:52:58 <FromGitter>	<APIInterfacing> I'm trying to use https://github.com/tchajed/spacemacs-coq for my Coq layer but man oh man... the text replacement or auto-completion is killing me with how bad and annoying it is
Apr 12 20:53:23 <FromGitter>	<APIInterfacing> Does anyone have any know how to fix this? I don't know if it's company-coq or what, but I can't deal with this anymore
Apr 12 20:54:37 <FromGitter>	<APIInterfacing> For example, if I type `a.` it will change that to `auto.`
Apr 12 20:54:46 <FromGitter>	<APIInterfacing> Or if I write `v.` it will change that to `Variable #: #..`
Apr 12 21:07:44 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @mivade the undo-tree package is part of the spacemacs distribution configuration, so surprised its failing.  Did you add `undo-tree` as an additional package in `.spacemacs` or is it just failing during initial download of all Spacemacs packages?  If you have change your .spacemacs file, can you share what you changed. ⏎ Otherwise, delete or move the undo-tree package from `~/.emacs/elpa/` if it downloaded. ⏎ 
Apr 12 21:07:44 <FromGitter>	... Are you using Emacs 26.3, the latest stable version?
Apr 12 21:09:34 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> If you are not using Spacemacs `develop` branch, you could also try that (may be a bug only fixed in `develop`) - https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/install-spacemacs/switch-to-develop.html

Apr 17 15:48:46 <FromGitter>	<pth91> Hi there quick question. I do not know whether this is against org-mode philosophy but is there any chance to clock in two different tasks across different .org files? I am in the dev branch of spacemacs.
Apr 17 16:35:55 <FromGitter>	<alchtech> Hey guys, how do you create a simple and plain list in .org modeß
Apr 17 16:42:26 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` John Stevenson (Gitter):  thanks for the reply. how do I set whitespace clean up in my file?
Apr 17 17:42:45 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @alchtech it worked for me: go to the (empty) scratch buffer, start org-mode, create the first item and then press 'o' to see a new line starting with '- '
Apr 17 18:22:52 <FromGitter>	<Jks15063> how do you load a specific version of a package
Apr 17 18:22:58 <FromGitter>	<Jks15063> I want an older version of magit
Apr 17 18:29:05 <FromGitter>	<Jks15063> and org mode too probably lol
Apr 17 18:47:36 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @Jks15063 maybe look for it in `package-list-packages`
Apr 17 19:23:24 <FromGitter>	<biocyberman> @smile13241324  Just found out that `knitr` functionality in `ESS` layer are removed in `develop` branch. Do you know if there is a plan to put it back?
Apr 17 21:29:02 <FromGitter>	<aaronchall> Maybe I'm doing it wrong - but when I do `SPC` `f` `f` and start typing in a path, and then Alt-Tab to another program and then click Emacs to finish typing the path, I can't resume typing and I can't click back into where I was typing to finish typing... basically I sometimes have to kill emacs to be able to do it. If I alt-tab cleanly back, seems to be ok, though. thoughts?
Apr 17 21:38:33 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @aaronchall when you have helm open, like with `SPC f f` it does seem to break if you click with your mouse.  I found that if you press `SPC` a few times, usually twice, it clears up again.   ⏎ The work-around is to not click and use Alt-TAB or Shift-Alt-TAB.  Probably worth raising an issue about this, `SPC h I`.
Apr 17 21:42:07 <FromGitter>	<ennoausberlin> Hello. Can someone confirm if the chicken scheme documentation lookup works in scheme layer (geiser)?
Apr 17 21:43:37 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @matrixbot `dotspacemacs-whitespace-cleanup 'all` will clean all whitespace every time you save the file.  You can find this in your `.spacemacs` file, although its probably set to nil by default.   ⏎ `SPC f e d` to open your .spacemacs file and `SPC s s whitespace` to find the existing config.  Then just change from nil to `'all`.  Dont forget the `'` for values that are not `nil` or `t`
Apr 17 21:48:58 <FromGitter>	<aaronchall> @jr0cket thanks, I'll consider raising an issue...
Apr 17 22:01:28 <FromGitter>	<chbaker0> hey, not sure if this is a good place to ask this question, but: I'm writing C++, and I want to take the results of lsp-find-references and do a query-replace on all of them
Apr 17 22:02:04 <FromGitter>	<chbaker0> is there a way to do this?
Apr 17 22:40:37 <FromGitter>	<chbaker0> ok, looks like there's xref-query-replace-in-results that you can run in an xref results buffer...but this doesn't seem compatible with helm?
Apr 18 02:16:14 <FromGitter>	<mastokley_gitlab> I've written a custom elisp function to load random themes. How can I "expose" that function to myself for regular use, eg via helm?
Apr 18 02:17:16 <FromGitter>	<mastokley_gitlab> `(interactive)`?
Apr 18 02:17:38 <FromGitter>	<mastokley_gitlab> aha! that seems to do it.
Apr 18 05:42:14 <FromGitter>	<theckman> Is anyone here familiar with `lsp-mode` and the Go layer? Just did a big upgrade after a long while on the develop branch, and support for the LSP server I had been using was removed. So I installed all the commands in the README, and expected to see the same things I did before and now I see nothing. I was used to hovering over a function name with my cursor, and having its header show up at the bottom.
Apr 18 05:44:37 <FromGitter>	<theckman> I'm trying to figure out what I'm missing, because it's probably simple, but I'm not sure. The one upside is I do see it monitoring the process of the language server.

Apr 19 18:02:51 <FromGitter>	<herop> Rookie question: Will a mildly nerdy Emacs beginner with only little knowledge in Emacs (and even less in vi(m) be able to cope with what org-mode can do in spacemacs?
Apr 19 18:04:26 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> yes
Apr 19 18:04:32 <FromGitter>	<herop> I'm a huuuge fan of Markdown and jumped in this weekend with Emacs -> Spacemacs to replace RoamReasearch. What is your assessment? Will it cost me weeks or just one or 2 weekends to make that happen?
Apr 19 18:06:54 <FromGitter>	<herop> Currently on the wonderful: Learn Emacs Org Mode: Spacemacs Intro Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVsSOmUB7ic&list=TLPQMTkwNDIwMjAcbGTvDHmBUQ&index=4) and I understand 10%. :-) He is fast like hell.
Apr 19 18:08:42 <FromGitter>	<herop> @yyoncho : I figured that you have replied and wated to thank you. 👍🙏
Apr 19 18:08:52 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> It depends on what you want to achieve - learn the basics and then learn something new every day
Apr 19 18:09:57 <FromGitter>	<herop> Exactly. Say if a'm able to write some notes (maybe even using markdown) and then learn some more every day would be fantastic.
Apr 19 18:12:54 <FromGitter>	<herop> I'm a ruthless learner though. Sitting the entire day now and at least was able to install Emacs 26.09 on Win10, the org-mode and markdown-mode, only to learn that all that comes with spacemacs. Well done, J. 🤭🙄
Apr 19 18:33:50 <FromGitter>	<aurabindo_gitlab> Hi, with Magit, is there an easy way to apply a series of external patches (available as files) through dired or treemacs?
Apr 19 19:05:52 <drw77_>	when I have a code snippet in a Markdown file (using the Markdown major mode) the font of that code is not what I want.  The rest of the document is the default font, which is fine.  How can I edit the ```<codesection``` font in Markdown buffers?
Apr 19 19:25:06 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @herop I learned Vim style editing by using Spacemacs, I wrote a section on vim basics here that you may find useful https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/spacemacs-basics/vim-basics.html
Apr 19 19:33:29 <FromGitter>	<herop> @jr0cket Definitely going to check that out. Just worked a day in Roam to create cheat sheets on Emacs commands and now learned Spacemacs is deep into vim instead. Well done btw. Like the style a lot.
Apr 19 19:51:42 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Thank you

Apr 19 21:34:49 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @aurabindo_gitlab can't you use magit's `w w` and mark them?
Apr 19 21:36:14 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @yyoncho can you help me understand a problem with lsp and c++? i'm trying to set `ccls-args` but when restarting workspace lsp will switch to `clangd` without telling me why
Apr 19 21:38:31 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @SreenivasVRao an easy way would be to create your own function that disables visual line mode before calling avy-goto-line
Apr 19 22:01:34 <FromGitter>	<aurabindo_gitlab> @igoralmeida  I'm only able to select one patch at a time when using `w w` in the minibuffer. Is there a way to select multiple entries there ?
Apr 19 22:01:41 <FromGitter>	<aurabindo_gitlab> wild card did not work
Apr 19 22:07:00 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> i know you can mark with c-spc
Apr 19 22:07:51 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> maybe you can mark them in dired and then call the `w w` function directly
Apr 19 22:07:51 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> `magit-apply-patches`?
Apr 19 22:11:34 <FromGitter>	<hariseldon78> hey guys, anyone can help me with this:  https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/57899/spacemacs-unmapping-treemacs-page-up-and-page-down ?
Apr 19 22:16:52 <FromGitter>	<aurabindo_gitlab> Marking seems to work with C-SPC in the minibuffer but magit is only showing only the last selection into the am process.
Apr 19 22:19:47 <FromGitter>	<plicatibu_twitter> @jr0cket  It worked like a charm. Thank you.
Apr 19 22:25:14 <FromGitter>	<aurabindo_gitlab> @igoralmeida  looks like magit doesnt support patching files that lie in some location outside the git directory. https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/50236/how-to-specify-multiple-patch-files-to-be-applied-by-magit
Apr 19 22:38:08 <FromGitter>	<thanhvg> have anyone tried `gccemacs`? it's very fast but evil objects are broken for me.  For example `vio` ,   viw` ect won't select the whole object

Apr 20 10:34:36 <FromGitter>	<cviebig> Hi, can you please point me to the code which configures the color of the project segment on the mode line? I'm on deeper-blue theme and it's yellow which is what I would like to change
Apr 20 10:34:51 <FromGitter>	<magthe> When I switch into org-mode persp (`SPC l o o`) one specific org file is opened. Unfortunately it's not the org file I'd like to have opened :/ Can I control that in some way?
Apr 20 11:15:12 <FromGitter>	<magthe> Or, even better, load a persp layout file on emacs start.
Apr 20 12:40:11 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @magthe `SPC l o o` is a custom layout that comes with Spacemacs and displays your org-agenda files. I'd suggest creating your own custom layout https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#custom-layouts
Apr 20 12:40:50 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Alternatively, search the Spacemacs source code for the definition and see how it works.
Apr 20 12:43:25 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I am unclear about what is meant by "load a persp layout file on emacs start".   ⏎ Spacemacs will load your previous layouts if you set `dotspacemacs-auto-resume-layouts t` in the `.spacemacs` file
Apr 20 12:53:06 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @cviebig `SPC h d F` will list all the faces used in the current theme.  Try typing in `mode-line` or `persp` to narrow that list of faces and see which one matches the color you want to change.
Apr 20 12:54:28 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> There may be a better way that that, but that is what I would try.  For faces in the text of a buffer, you can use `SPC h d c` and it will show the face used for that character as part of the description
Apr 20 14:28:16 <FromGitter>	<cviebig> @jr0cket I have checked the deeper-blue theme definition and https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c7a103a772d808101d7635ec10f292ab9202d9ee/core/libs/spacemacs-theme/spacemacs-common.el#L78 already. Still there is none, that fits neither from it's description, nor from the color. Do you know where the spacemacs modeline related code is located? I was not able to find it yesterday :-(
Apr 20 14:32:46 <FromGitter>	<cviebig> @jr0cket Thank you for recommending `SPC h d F`. That's a great helper. Unfortunately I did not find a matching color
Apr 20 14:45:00 <FromGitter>	<bschwarzer> Hi, is it possible to show auto-completion with tab when no chars have been typed?
Apr 20 14:56:21 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @cviebig sorry, themes are a bit of a mystery to me at the moment.  I spend an hour hacking some colors for the doom-solarized-light theme and either changed something different or changed more colors than expected :) ⏎ I changed a color at a time and reloaded the theme using `SPC T s`, first switching to another them and then switching back to the changed theme.  I managed to get a few changes that I am happy 
Apr 20 14:56:22 <FromGitter>	... with, but need to move on to more productive things...
Apr 20 15:10:34 <FromGitter>	<cviebig> @jr0cket Sure, thank you though :-) Have a good day!

I understand the newest version of orgmode as undefined the variable in favor of another. Is babel under spacemacs able to cope? I've updated my install via develop and reinstalled my elpa directory.  Thanks in advance

I tried on my own layer: `(spacemacs/declare-prefix-for-mode 'ess-r-mode "mp" "poly")`  and got error:  `Symbol's function definition is void: which-key-add-major-mode-key-based-replacements`

Apr 21 11:28:13 <sonjah>	hi do i need to turn syntax highlighting on manually or why does it not do that?
Apr 21 11:59:13 <sonjah>	nm problem was between chair and monitor
Apr 21 12:17:27 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> hmm.. why does (browse-url-xdg-open "https://github.com") in emacs use a different browser than xdg-open "https://github.com" in the terminal??
Apr 21 12:20:23 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> ah, this is probably nixos issue. emacs has been wrapped so that XDG_DATA_DIRS is different inside emacs than in my desktop environment otherwise
Apr 21 12:20:45 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> so my default browser definition isn't found by emacs environment
Apr 21 12:58:19 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> How to move one chapter from file1.org to file2.org? There are some link path "file://xx.jpg" in the file1.org and file2.org.
Apr 21 13:00:30 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> nope, it wasn't nixos issue. with vanilla emacs, XDG_DATA_DIRS is correct inside emacs GUI. with spacemacs GUI, it's not. so most likely some spacemacs issue i guess
Apr 21 13:02:51 <FromGitter>	<Alexander-Miller> @Cassiel-girl org-refile can do that, though I don't think it is smart enough to fix file paths, you'll probably have to do that manually
Apr 21 13:05:50 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> oh, what, spacemacs loads environment variables from .spacemacs.env.. why does it do that? why can't it just use the environment variables that it has in the environment? can i disable this somehow? and why do they get loaded in GUI but not in CLI?
Apr 21 13:07:27 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> it has stored in that file even environment variables that aren't persistent from one session to another, that makes no sense to me
Apr 21 13:23:03 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> ok, that all the relevant information and help in the header, so never mind :)
Apr 21 13:23:24 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> s/that/that file had/
Apr 21 13:23:53 <FromGitter>	<jluttine> but still i don't understand why then spacemacs CLI was unaffected..

Apr 22 10:17:21 <FromGitter>	<pubple> @jr0cket & @yyoncho thank you for your support. I changed the config with this `dotspacemacs-persistent-server t` then I open emacs, then I use `emacsclient -t` but I got another issue which is the theme color. `How to get back the beautiful theme color as in emacs`?

Apr 22 14:22:11 <FromGitter>	<cuppajoeman> I want to become more reliant on the built-in help system. I usually like to hopen up the layer documentation first when I need to learn about something, does anyone have any suggestions or workflows they use to get help on stuff like this?
Apr 22 14:31:40 <FromGitter>	<fleimgruber> @SreenivasVRao thanks, I found it moments later, see https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e9fde2a71a34b0149000c28.
Apr 22 15:33:54 <FromGitter>	<jagipson_twitter> ooph. I'm at wit's end trying to get started with spacemacs particularly orgmode. I expected that when I pressed C-z it would restore the emacs keybinding for org mode... is this incorrect?
Apr 22 15:38:47 <oxalis>	I'm having trouble with org mode (I just started using spacemacs). I press C-z to enter the emacs key bindings, but the org mode bindings don't seem to be working.... I expected from emacs mode I could use C-c a  to show the agenda menu buffer but that's not working 
Apr 22 15:39:31 <oxalis>	oops.  Didn't realize it was the same chat
Apr 22 15:43:44 <FromGitter>	<apj68> @jagipson_twitter , what are you trying to do? I basically use the key bindings described in chapter 3 (https://www.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html#key-bindings) of the ORG doc.  Did you see that?
Apr 22 15:44:21 <oxalis>	I just verified that my org layer was commented out in .spacemacs... I remember uncommenting it so not sure what happened
Apr 22 15:44:44 <oxalis>	I'm connecting that system to the net to see If it launches now
Apr 22 15:45:00 <oxalis>	It's installing packages...
Apr 22 15:47:22 <oxalis>	that was it! (facepalm)
Apr 22 15:47:52 <oxalis>	somehow my configuration reverted to factory - probably my fault because I was juggling configs
Apr 22 15:58:31 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @cuppajoeman I mainly use `SPC h d f` to describe functions.  If I want to know more, I use `RET` on the file name the function is defined in and it displays the code in a buffer. ⏎ I should use the built in layer docs more (got too used to looking at develop.spacemacs.org layer list).  Once the layer README is open, then I would use `TAB TAB` to open all the sections and `SPC s s` to search for something 
Apr 22 15:58:31 <FromGitter>	... specific.  Or just use `]` and `[` to navigate the headings.
Apr 22 16:03:43 <FromGitter>	<pubple> @jr0cket @MenkeTechnologies @yyoncho  thank you very much for your help. Maybe I messed something in the configuration file. Therefore I reinstalled emacs-plus, and then spacemacs with standard option. From there I ran ‘emacs -nw’ as a emacs server,  then ‘emacsclient -t’ for any new terminal session. It works well and fast, no need to change theme or anything. I just put here for anyone who may prefer 
Apr 22 16:03:43 <FromGitter>	... speed, and just want to do things in terminal.
Apr 22 16:13:33 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @jr0cket it's also useful to press TAB after M-x to see the help for the current function before running it, but i'd love to be able to close the help window as well
Apr 22 16:32:35 <FromGitter>	<pubple> Can anyone share a guidance of setting spacemacs as an IDE for modern Javascript development(support jsx, react, vue, es6+ syntax)? I did use these below layers but it still doesn’t work as what I expected. These layers are ‘javascript, react’. I did these things: ‘npm install -g’ other tools as guided in each layer doc, like ‘tern’, and setup ‘.tern-project’ for my js app as well, and checking 
Apr 22 16:32:35 <FromGitter>	... that tern server was working but while editing ‘js’ or ‘jsx’ with spacemacs, it still doesn’t support autocomplete, hinting for function’s parameters, object’s properties, auto prettify after save,...Let’s say while I’m typing “cons” it should show a menu list which includes “console,...” for me to navigate and choose.
Apr 22 16:34:01 <FromGitter>	<pubple> If I choose ‘console’ the type ‘.’ it should brings a menu of all console methods like log, info, profile,...
Apr 22 16:36:04 <FromGitter>	<pubple> Sorry for any inconvenience of what I typed without any highlighting because I’m writing on my mobile
Apr 22 16:36:32 <FromGitter>	<pubple> Thank you for your help
Apr 22 16:53:26 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @igoralmeida ah, `TAB` after `SPC SPC` is handy, although helm seems to keep hold of the active window, so you cant select the *Help* buffer and using `q` to quit.  Yes, more than a bit annoying.  The *Help* buffer does go away when you select or cancel and it is updated if you `TAB` on another entry, so I can get used to this.  Thanks
Apr 22 16:58:55 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @pubple my only advice is to check `autocomplete` layer has been added to your layer list in .spacemacs and restart Emacs.
Apr 22 17:21:05 <FromGitter>	<Moonkir_twitter> spacemcas is stuck on Contacting host
Apr 22 17:21:14 <FromGitter>	<Moonkir_twitter> what can I do ?
Apr 22 17:23:12 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @Moonkir_twitter not much info there, I assume you've tried pressing `C-g` (control g) until your fingers hurt :)  Also try `ESC` and `fd`.
Apr 22 17:23:31 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> What were you doing (or trying to do).
Apr 22 17:25:06 <FromGitter>	<Moonkir_twitter> Adding the layer pdf-tools
Apr 22 18:02:24 <oxalis>	okay -  I got everything working with the slight caveat that somehow capital C is bound as a prefix to something in insert mode and emacs mode. I can't seem to figure out what, because ^H k C  just says it's bound to change line (as would be expected for "normal" mode)
Apr 22 18:03:14 <oxalis>	I think capital C is mapped to Ctrl, somehow
Apr 22 18:04:40 <oxalis>	when I type shift-c  the minibuffer shows:    - -> +prefix 
Apr 22 18:04:54 <oxalis>	and C-  [C=h paging/help]
Apr 22 18:10:07 <oxalis>	okay - I fixed it by evicting Eyebrowse
Apr 22 18:38:32 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> Hi all, it seems that spacemacs doesn't have access to my environment or shell correctly, it can't find js-ts langserver and also can't install it because it doesn't have access to npm, how can I fix this?
Apr 22 18:40:25 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @BrandonShega install it manually
Apr 22 18:40:41 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> I have, I use it with vim and vscode just fine
Apr 22 18:40:42 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> lsp-mode readme has the corresponding commands
Apr 22 18:41:36 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> Then they are not on the path used by emacs. Check if (executable-find "tsserver") and (executable-find "typescript-language-server")  return the correct paths
Apr 22 18:42:32 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> Ya, that was my concern, and what I wanted to fix if I can
Apr 22 18:44:22 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> SPC f e e and fix your path
Apr 22 18:44:57 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> both of those commands return `nil`
Apr 22 18:46:07 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> oh interesting, it seems that spacemacs only has my node 10.9.0 in the path
Apr 22 18:46:18 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> but my current version set with nvm is 12.0.0, that's probably why
Apr 22 19:31:35 <FromGitter>	<anlsh> How can I customize the keybindings for things like `SPC f f`?
Apr 22 19:33:36 <FromGitter>	<igoralmeida> @anlsh `spacemacs/set-leader-keys`, and you drop the SPC
Apr 22 19:36:27 <FromGitter>	<anlsh> Thank you!

Apr 23 14:28:10 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @karcio Sounds like Emacs is using a different home directory.  If you open a file, does the default home folder contain the .emacs.d directory.

Apr 23 15:43:41 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Someone asked about Helm loosing focus when clicking elsewhere with the mouse, eg. like switching to a different application window and back again.  Using `SPC w b` gets the focus back on helm.  So if you `SPC f f` and click somewhere else its not possible to type, but `SPC w b` focuses the mini-buffer window and therefore helm.

After typing `*` while having the cursor on the symbol, the  Symbol Highlight Transient State comes up. After typing `e`, I get into a "red" mode - but I can't figure out, how to use it.

I am not seeing any errors in the Messages buffer either.  Any ideas where I would look to debug this?  Thanks very much!
Apr 23 19:42:52 <FromGitter>	<herop> Hi @dam5h , did you try to start Emacs with --debug flag? Did forget the exact syntax. Likewise, you could refresh the packages installed. For the sake of it - you did restart emacs, right? 😺
Apr 23 19:48:32 <FromGitter>	<dam5h> Howdy Jochen!  Yes I did restart and also tried the `--debug` flag just now.  I see no messages in the messages buffer added when trying to run `helm-resume`, it just simply does nothing, as if I haven't entered any command
Apr 23 21:23:17 <FromGitter>	<herop> Even though I don't know what helm-resume does, did you try to delete corresponding folder in layers and restart? It should reinstall the package.

Apr 24 05:03:57 <FromGitter>	<SreenivasVRao> I'm able to get pretty colors in Ubuntu 16. ⏎ I tried following on this: ⏎ https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/2775 but the solution didn't work for me.
Apr 24 05:07:00 <FromGitter>	<SreenivasVRao> ah just found the solution. OSX needs an env var to be set: CLICOLOR=1  ⏎  ⏎ cheers. I'll post on that issue in case someone stumbles on it! :)
Apr 24 07:35:10 <FromGitter>	<haquezameer> Hi people

Apr 24 08:58:10 <FromGitter>	<haquezameer> what is C-u?
Apr 24 08:59:02 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> Hold control and press u
Apr 24 09:01:37 <FromGitter>	<haquezameer> yeah cool.. just pressing tab worked

Apr 24 09:02:40 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @haquezameer do C-u TAB to expand all

Oct 15 19:13:30 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> Hello everyone! Hope this message find you well. I am trying to setup up the Scala layer. When running the GUI interface i get `No Java runtime present, requesting install.` how ever when running emacs from a terminal the the LSP server starts no problem. I am sure that is a path issue but not sure how to fix it any suggestions?
Oct 15 19:29:05 <FromGitter>	<milochadam> @EstebanMarin I think the easiest would be to add `(add-to-list 'exec-path "PATH_TO_JAVA")` in your config
Oct 15 19:50:45 <FromGitter>	<milochadam> Where `PATH_TO_JAVA` is actually path to directory with java
Oct 15 20:08:48 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> @milochadam thanks for the reply so I did  ⏎ echo $JAVA_HOME ⏎ /Users/marinest/.sdkman/candidates/java/current ⏎ This is the path you are mentioning? [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5f889e4aa7e77a0ff14c6a45]
Oct 15 20:10:10 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> Also `(add-to-list 'exec-path "PATH_TO_JAVA”)` you mean in the `.spacemacs` file
Oct 15 20:10:35 <FromGitter>	<milochadam> @EstebanMarin Probably. The message says `No Java runtime present`. Is there a jre binary in the directory you mentioned?
Oct 15 20:10:58 <FromGitter>	<milochadam> Yes, `.spacemacs` file in `user-config` function
Oct 15 20:16:44 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> @milochadam there is a `bin` folder and there seems  ⏎ `ls /Users/marinest/.sdkman/candidates/java/current`=> `bin     conf    include jmods   legal   lib     release`
Oct 15 20:18:00 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> within the `ls bin` => all of them `-rwxr-xr-x`
Oct 15 20:18:09 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> So I think they are excutables
Oct 15 20:19:40 <FromGitter>	<EstebanMarin> Let me try if it works

Oct 16 08:53:28 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> any idea how to yank all within a cell in org table?
Oct 16 11:06:39 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @chama-chomo tomselect things I use `SPC v` followed by as many `v`s as needed to select everything, `V` if the selection gets too big.  Then `y` to yank the selection.
Oct 16 11:10:51 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @EstebanMarinBuilt sounds like the path setting is in your shells rc file, e.g bash_rc, and not in your shell profile, eg. .profile ⏎ Adding to the Java path to the profile will ensure Java is available from apps run from a launcher, e.g a desktop launcher or menu.
Oct 16 11:13:16 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> Use `which java` in a terminal to find the executable path of a binary
Oct 16 11:16:18 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> If using Spacemacs develop branch, then you can add the path via `spacemacs.env` file, open with `SPC f e e’.  Although this only fixes Java for Emacs.  Ideally you should ensure your profile has the right path.  A simple way is for your profile to source the shell rc file.
Oct 16 11:34:07 <roshanavand>	spacemacs is automatically adding "#coding: utf-8" in the beginning of my ruby file (which contain utf8 chars), how can I stop it from doing so?

Oct 20 11:07:53 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Uh, what did you do to run that code?
Oct 20 11:08:00 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Oh
Oct 20 11:08:01 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Althouhg it is version 5.3.5
Oct 20 11:08:35 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > Uh, what did you do to run that code? ⏎  ⏎ Just add the lua layer, and then press `, s b` in the lua file
Oct 20 11:08:40 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> /buffer
Oct 20 11:08:46 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> It couldn't be a version issue right?
Oct 20 11:08:52 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Yeah, I did that
Oct 20 11:10:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > It couldn't be a version issue right?
Oct 20 11:10:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Generally language updates should not break old code
Oct 20 11:11:14 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I think so too.
Oct 20 11:11:15 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> You can be quite sure it is not about the version
Oct 20 11:11:53 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But which OS you use?
Oct 20 11:12:11 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Windows
Oct 20 11:12:21 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah...
Oct 20 11:12:38 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I would strongly recommend to run linux in a VM
Oct 20 11:12:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> And use Emacs there
Oct 20 11:13:12 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> @dalanicolai btw my problem with side windows wasn't because of cargo build invocation, but 'format-on-save' feature which always creates a side buffer when something is wrong with the syntax. i've just set additional rule and it seems ok now. `rust-format-show-buffer nil`
Oct 20 11:13:20 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Sounds like it would make my life easier
Oct 20 11:13:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I am not a developer... it is just what I think
Oct 20 11:14:21 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I don't have much space to spare though
Oct 20 11:17:51 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @chama-chomo Haha okay. But I also got a 'side-window' on building. And so the quiet build mode helped hiding that window. But anyway, nice to know about the format-on-save feature. And thanks for sharing the problem and its solution...
Oct 20 11:18:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha... yeah that is annoying
Oct 20 11:18:34 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well I guess things should work fine on Windows too... but generally I think it is harder to make things work
Oct 20 11:19:32 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> with Emacs
Oct 20 11:19:39 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> side-window on building gets created too, but you can close it by pressing `q`, which is ok. Perhaps giving it focus as well (right after build ends up), would be nice.
Oct 20 11:19:56 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> right
Oct 20 11:21:00 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I'm going to build lua 5.3.5
Oct 20 11:21:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah yeah... I think giving it focus should be the default indeed. I would say not switching the focus is a bug. But not a very big deal
Oct 20 11:21:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Otherwise you could report it if you like
Oct 20 11:22:04 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> tdin:1: j:/Files/main.lua:36: syntax error near <eof> ⏎ stack traceback: ⏎ 	[C]: in function 'error' ⏎ 	stdin:1: in function 'luamode_loadstring' ⏎ 	stdin:1: in main chunk ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5f8eba5a3d172d78b387e75c]
Oct 20 11:22:20 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> That's probably the most helpful error I've gotten
Oct 20 11:22:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah okay... I don't expect it to make a difference... but you never know
Oct 20 11:22:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Good luck
Oct 20 11:41:45 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> It uh, is not version specific.
Oct 20 11:43:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah... was to be expected indeed
Oct 20 11:43:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I think I can not help you. It could be an Emacs on windows thing
Oct 20 11:43:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Or many other things
Oct 20 11:44:30 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I can not reproduce it here
Oct 20 11:44:42 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I've got the whole "package cl is deprecated" thing still, could that do it?
Oct 20 11:45:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I can just advice to try to run Ubuntu in virtualbox and use that...
Oct 20 11:46:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Or just in HyperV if you use some expensive windows version
Oct 20 11:47:18 <FromGitter>	<humitos> hi! is there a way to run `SPC s P` (`(spacemacs/helm-project-smart-do-search-region-or-symbol)`) but instead to search only in the current project, search over all the projects that are currently opened?
Oct 20 11:47:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Or maybe try the Emacs channel...
Oct 20 11:48:07 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Yeah, I don't know how much further I could get to a clean install.
Oct 20 11:49:18 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I'm on the develop branch, added the lua layer, customized the exec path to include my lua installation, and that's it.
Oct 20 11:49:40 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> i will, indeed
Oct 20 11:49:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I don't know how Emacs works on windows. But in linux after deleting/renaming your .spacemacs file, the install should be clean
Oct 20 11:50:02 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Yeah, I did that.
Oct 20 11:50:18 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > I'm on the develop branch, added the lua layer, customized the exec path to include my lua installation, and that's it. ⏎  ⏎ Yeah sounds fine to me
Oct 20 11:51:18 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Yeah, and this is just about a virgin pc I'm using
Oct 20 11:51:45 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I'll have to just put up an issue for now then.
Oct 20 11:51:56 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Thanks for your time man.
Oct 20 11:52:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah good idea
Oct 20 11:52:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> No problem... good luck
Oct 20 11:52:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But don't give up on Spacemacs... it is really awesome
Oct 20 11:54:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well maybe, if some other editor works better on windows, of course you should use that... but keep Spacemacs in mind... it is really the most powerful (and elegant) editing environment I know
Oct 20 12:00:43 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> actually, i'm not decided what should be the default. There are some cases you don't want to have it closed right away and you want to follow up errors compilator gave you. I think it makes sense
Oct 20 12:03:25 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah, I get your point. I would just prefer if the compilation window was selected, so you could delete it with q, or switch back to your code without closing it
Oct 20 12:04:10 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Would be nice if it was easier configurable. But over all not very important anyway
Oct 20 12:05:40 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > Yeah, I get your point. I would just prefer if the compilation window was selected, so you could delete it with q, or switch back to your code without closing it
Oct 20 12:06:06 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Like when you get an Emacs lisp error, you can just close it with `q` or decide not to close it and switch to back to your code
Oct 20 12:16:55 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> ofc it's not a regression, something nice to have
Oct 20 12:17:54 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> i went even through compilation-mode, cargo.el and so, but there doesn't seem to be any configuration available for it
Oct 20 12:18:45 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> however, i've found this, you might find it useful too
Oct 20 12:18:48 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> `compilation-ask-about-save nil`
Oct 20 12:19:49 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> hi! is there command to jump  or the last *edited* buffer?
Oct 20 12:20:11 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> I'm looking for it since ages
Oct 20 12:20:41 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> `SPC tab` ?
Oct 20 12:21:48 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> The reason my thing was broken is that somehow I built lua wrong
Oct 20 12:22:07 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I downloaded one already put together and that seems to have worked
Oct 20 12:23:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @Diminim Wow, great news! Weird that it could be build wrong, but anyway it works now then...
Oct 20 12:23:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah, looked for some cinfiguraiton options also
Oct 20 12:23:48 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> That's alternate not the last EDITED buffer. From the docu:
Oct 20 12:23:50 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> ``````
Oct 20 12:24:03 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> Yeah, that's all that matters.
Oct 20 12:24:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well it is not hard to write a function that compiles and switches to the buffer automatically
Oct 20 12:24:12 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> `Switch back and forth between current and last buffer in the ⏎ current window.`
Oct 20 12:24:32 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> not sure what you mean then
Oct 20 12:24:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Thanks fot he ask-about-save thing
Oct 20 12:25:10 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> Well I have a many buffers open. And I switch back and forth between them...
Oct 20 12:25:12 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> you mean, after you jump to another buffer with e.g. jump-to-definition?
Oct 20 12:25:17 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Will keep it in mind, because I am not writing much code besides latex and elisp at the moment
Oct 20 12:25:47 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> and then you want to get back to the previous?
Oct 20 12:25:53 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> and then I'd like to jump to buffer where I did the last change.
Oct 20 12:26:08 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> `Ctrl o` ?
Oct 20 12:26:35 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> Uhm... leme test it
Oct 20 12:27:18 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> No. `Ctrl o` doesn't do what I need.
Oct 20 12:27:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> To get the complement `C-i` working, you have to set it to not behave like `tab` in your .spacemacs file
Oct 20 12:29:47 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> > To get the complement `C-i` working, you have to set it to not behave like `tab` in your .spacemacs file ⏎  ⏎ I guess this is not the thread you wanted to write your reply to, right?
Oct 20 12:29:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Maybe this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469644/is-there-emacs-capability-for-visiting-last-edits)
Oct 20 12:29:50 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> urw
Oct 20 12:30:10 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes, `C-i` is the complement of `C-o`
Oct 20 12:30:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > Maybe this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469644/is-there-emacs-capability-for-visiting-last-edits) ⏎  ⏎ And this post could answer your question
Oct 20 12:30:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> possibly
Oct 20 12:31:20 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> > Maybe this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469644/is-there-emacs-capability-for-visiting-last-edits) ⏎  ⏎ No unfortunately none of that does what I mean.
Oct 20 12:31:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> i.e. `SPC j c`
Oct 20 12:31:24 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> assuming you work in vi-mode, not sure the same emacs mode offers
Oct 20 12:31:38 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> since this is a vim feature
Oct 20 12:32:49 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > since this is a vim feature, talking about `C-i` and `C-o` ⏎  ⏎ Ah that is vim but not vi?
Oct 20 12:33:06 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> Anyway I wonder if I'm really the first person with such a question. Guys have you really never before had the need to jump to the last thing you edited regardless of the buffer you're currently in?
Oct 20 12:33:08 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> i'm not sure, honestly
Oct 20 12:34:41 <FromGitter>	<chama-chomo> well, I'm using `C-o` to jump to the last place I left
Oct 20 12:34:50 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> `SPC j c` is `got-last-change` and that applies to the currently visited buffer. Not the list  of opened buffers.
Oct 20 12:35:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Me too C-o
Oct 20 12:35:10 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > `SPC j c` is `got-last-change` and that applies to the currently visited buffer. Not the list  of opened buffers. ⏎  ⏎ Yes I see now
Oct 20 12:35:11 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> Oh. I'm desperate.
Oct 20 12:36:11 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > Maybe this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469644/is-there-emacs-capability-for-visiting-last-edits) ⏎  ⏎ But I guess the last answer here does what you want?
Oct 20 12:36:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Although I am not sure what it does exactly
Oct 20 12:38:03 <FromGitter>	<Diminim> I downloaded other binaries, only one works, I have less than no idea why
Oct 20 12:38:32 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha... me neither
Oct 20 12:39:04 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> > > Maybe this (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16469644/is-there-emacs-capability-for-visiting-last-edits) ⏎ >  ⏎ > But I guess the last answer here does what you want? ⏎  ⏎ NO! Again it jumps to the last change in the CURRENT buffer. [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5f8ecc67a0a3072b439312ff]
Oct 20 12:39:32 <FromGitter>	<rostislav.svoboda_gitlab> Never mind. I just started hacking something...
Oct 20 12:39:58 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah okay... it says it jumps to last change in any buffer
Oct 20 12:40:31 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> The answer by Braham Snyder
Oct 20 12:40:35 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Anyway... good luck
Oct 20 13:09:23 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> hi,
Oct 20 13:17:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @clanghans It is still in the required packages list in the git layer `packages.el` file.
Oct 20 13:18:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> It will probably get removed then, when someone finds the time/necessity for it
Oct 20 13:19:38 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Maybe it is handy to update the developers about it in an issue
Oct 20 13:21:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > hi,  ⏎ > can someone explain me why I still  have a git-commit package from ELPA in? I just read that this is now provided from magit?  ⏎  ⏎ With a link to the source where you have read this [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5f8ed647c7ef520fffb20506]
Oct 20 13:21:27 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GitCommitMode
Oct 20 13:23:05 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Interesting... and good question
Oct 20 13:25:12 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> I will create an issue
Oct 20 13:25:49 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Great!
Oct 20 13:27:40 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I will remove it here from my `packages.el` and see if it causes any problems...
Oct 20 13:27:45 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Maybe you can do the same
Oct 20 13:28:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I quickly find the file using `SPC f L`
Oct 20 13:28:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> and search for `layer git`
Oct 20 13:28:49 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But you need to update your locate database first with `sudo updatedb`
Oct 20 13:29:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Just and idea...
Oct 20 13:30:48 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> I also want to update my spacemacs first. Is it recommended to use spacelpa?
Oct 20 13:45:21 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah I don't know
Oct 20 13:45:40 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I do not yet use Spacelpa
Oct 20 13:45:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But maybe I should
Oct 20 13:50:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> From reading the develop release notes in the `*spacemacs*` buffer, I think I will just keep with MELPA
Oct 20 13:56:54 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> do you know when the `packages.el`s are evaluated? Mine keeps working and also keeps that file
Oct 20 13:59:07 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> maybe another layer also depends on it
Oct 20 13:59:51 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I don't know exactly how all the loading works
Oct 20 14:00:26 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> this is a rabbit hole :)
Oct 20 14:01:20 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha
Oct 20 14:01:23 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes true
Oct 20 14:01:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Here it also isn't removed
Oct 20 14:01:46 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well it is not too important I guess
Oct 20 14:02:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But we can always search for git-commit using `SPC s f`
Oct 20 14:05:23 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> It is in the magit repo (https://github.com/magit/magit/tree/master/lisp)
Oct 20 14:06:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So I guess removing it from `packages.el` will not cause any problems
Oct 20 14:14:07 <FromGitter>	<clanghans> yes it is, but in the magit ELPA package the git-commit.el is not there it seems. Created the issue, we'll see what happens ⏎ issue (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/14069)
Oct 20 14:17:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I guess you mean MELPA, because I do not find magit on ELPA. But it is in the lisp directory of the magit repo here
Oct 20 14:17:14 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > It is in the magit repo (https://github.com/magit/magit/tree/master/lisp)
Oct 20 14:17:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I don't undrstand the multifile packages well
Oct 20 14:18:50 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But you can find the quelpa recipe in the file `~/.emacs.d/quelpa/melpa/recipes/magit`
Oct 20 14:20:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But you created the issue so I guess we should not try to understand everything in this rabbithole right now :)

Jan 27 19:46:03 <FromGitter>	<apj68> G'morning... I'm trying to add command to an existing evil command-mode binding.  I know how to do custom key binding but in spacemacs world, I want to add a letter under an existing command, I'm just not sure what it's called so I can't locate how to do it in the docs (https://www.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#key-bindings).  For example, in command mode if I type `gr` it brings me to the multiple-cursor 
Jan 27 19:46:03 <FromGitter>	... commands.  That's where I want to add a letter.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I'm just not sure what I need to search for, if it's a layer, a binding, an evil-mode thing... or??  Thanks for any help!

Feb 01 14:25:53 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @yyoncho Ah okay... I see what you mean... I made a little mistake in the PR... I broke the backtick functionality... I did not want that
Feb 01 14:27:12 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @dalanicolai IMHO wait for maintainers whether they won't non-vim functionality
Feb 01 14:28:06 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes of course... it is just a proposal... but I think a good one
Feb 01 14:28:23 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I also proposed to vim
Feb 01 14:29:51 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> Yeah, I know - just friendly advice :)
Feb 01 14:29:52 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But you pointed out a mistake already... I hope and guess it was the only mistake as I did check everything a few times already
Feb 01 14:30:09 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > Yeah, I know - just friendly advice :) ⏎  ⏎ Yeah great! Thanks for that of course
Feb 01 14:31:58 <FromGitter>	<88-percent> > if you're running spacemacs from git then you should create a branch to edit init.el ⏎  ⏎ then I'm really lucky to learn this before I had a problem. I've been reading as much as I can about emacs and spacemacs but it's pretty vast. I don't have any experience working with code.

Feb 03 20:52:02 <birkoff>	what else can be done ? 
Feb 03 20:53:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @birkhoff are you sure the packages are loaded?
Feb 03 20:53:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Try to load them with `M-x` load-library
Feb 03 20:54:28 <birkoff>	yes but why don't they get autoloaded on startup
Feb 03 20:54:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah wait
Feb 03 20:54:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> You should not install via list-packages

Feb 03 20:56:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Okay, then I don't know how it works
Feb 03 20:57:18 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> As far as I know additional-packages only installs the packages and adds the directories to the load path
Feb 03 20:57:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But unfortunately how it works was not explained anywhere...
Feb 03 21:01:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I investigated a little, and then updated the comment in the dotfile, explaining how additional-packages seems to work
Feb 03 21:01:15 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I never studied the code/source
Feb 03 21:11:14 <FromGitter>	<henriquenj> You can check the value of `dotspacemacs-install-packages` and see if changing `used-but-keep-unused` makes any difference

I have read https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html and while it does give a great overview of the loading of things and the general layout of things I did not understand how I should go about implementing my stuff inside `.emacs.d/private`.

My questions are: ⏎  ⏎ 1) Should I add a layer for this and add the functions just in funcs.el? ⏎ 2) Should I add a layer and a package to be configured via that layer? If so where would I put the package? In `.emacs.d/private/local`? Or is ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=6020202d1cb20228093b0381]

Feb 07 21:58:17 <FromGitter>	<jollyrogue:matrix.org> I usually split the layout and then open the second file or switch the buffer. I'm not sure how to do that in one comamnd.

Feb 09 14:31:13 <FromGitter>	<jrahhali> Hi all.  New to Spacemacs & Emacs.  Question about Dired.  Is there any way within Emacs/Spacemacs to determine all the available Dired actions?  I had to open up google and search for "deleting a file with dired in emacs".  I was wondering if there was an easy way to search for something like this within Emacs.  Thanks
Feb 09 14:35:17 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @jrahhali `SPC h k`
Feb 09 14:35:59 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @jrahhali `SPC t k m`
Feb 09 14:36:08 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> As a side note, try vinegar layer
Feb 09 14:36:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> https://develop.spacemacs.org/doc/DOCUMENTATION.html#which-key-persistent
Feb 09 14:37:11 <FromGitter>	<jrahhali> Thanks guys.  That's just what I was looking for!
Feb 09 14:37:21 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So switch off `SPC t k m` with `SPC t k k`
Feb 09 14:39:04 <FromGitter>	<jrahhali> Thanks @dalanicolai  for the documation link.

Feb 10 15:38:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @dylanhogan Thanks for feedback! 👍
Feb 10 16:28:50 <FromGitter>	<agzam> > The fasd package has been updated to support Ivy actions (~M-o~). After the fasd query, instead of enter, type ~M-o~ on some directory then press ~s~ to start a deep search in that directory. ⏎  ⏎ This is nice. Thank you @dalanicolai
Feb 10 16:31:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha! Your welcome. But I updated it because I did not know about `C-r`, so you can use that also to open search from history from the fasd ivy-buffer. Anyway, so we have two options now...
Feb 10 16:31:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @agzam
Feb 10 16:32:41 <FromGitter>	<agzam> Holy mother of Turing...   ⏎  ⏎ > 5b9612f57 - Add Emacs Application Framework (EAF) layer (3 days ago) <Daniel Nicolai> ⏎  ⏎ This is amazing. Does it work on Mac? Unfortunately I have to use a Mac (work requirement) [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=6023fc9e32e01b4f7188fe66]
Feb 10 16:33:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well it should work even on Windows (no tested)... so I guess it should work on mac also. Unfortunately I can not test it (I have no Mac)
Feb 10 16:35:15 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But having the browser is quite nice. The EAF guys did a very nice job!
Feb 10 16:35:36 <FromGitter>	<agzam> Wait.. how does `C-r` work? It seems to be doing something different than the action you've added
Feb 10 16:36:05 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Also, although their PDF-viewer is not PDF-tools... it does provide a nice continuous scroll
Feb 10 16:36:19 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> It just shows your history
Feb 10 16:36:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Of fasd searches
Feb 10 16:36:41 <FromGitter>	<agzam> > I can not test it ⏎ No worries. I'll be installing the layer posthaste
Feb 10 16:36:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So the first time you visit some dir you can use the action
Feb 10 16:37:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Subseqeunt times you can choose
Feb 10 16:38:43 <FromGitter>	<agzam> > It just shows your history ⏎ But that's not what `M-o s` does, right? I don't get it, how would you do exactly what your added action does but with `C-r`?
Feb 10 16:38:45 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Great! Would be nice to hear if it works of course. I have just made it to work 'spacemacsey' on Spacemacs. A lot more configuration can be added to the layer
Feb 10 16:39:27 <FromGitter>	<agzam> > It just shows your history ⏎  ⏎ But that's not what `M-o s` does, right? I don't get it, how would you do exactly what your added action does but with `C-r`?
Feb 10 16:40:38 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah... I was confused... I mean you can use `C-r` from `SPC s f`
Feb 10 16:46:39 <FromGitter>	<agzam> no, no. your added action is exactly what I needed for a long time, but I was too lazy to add it myself. I use fasd all the time, and very often (if not all the time) I need to immediately search in the directory.
Feb 10 16:49:06 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha very good! I was afraid I was the only one who would actually use this...
Feb 10 16:50:12 <golanv>	dalanicolai, Thanks.  I'll give that a try.

Feb 14 15:58:48 <FromGitter>	<qynn_gitlab> Hi there! I am trying out the Mu4e layer and anytime I am in a mu4e buffer (main view or header view)  <SPC> doesn't respond as it shoul  ( i get `End of buffer`) so I basically get stuck in the buffer and my only option is to quit... Is this a "normal" behavior? Note the mu4e Help buffer doesn't have that issue. Any help appreciated :)
Feb 14 19:23:06 <FromGitter>	<xged> spacemacs/ediff-dotfile-and-template not working properly. anybody else?

Feb 16 11:24:51 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @inzouzouwetrust These things started to work here after manually activating `reftex-mode`
Feb 16 11:26:10 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I guess this should get (better) documented indeed
Feb 16 11:31:46 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> @dalanicolai Thanks for your comment :) ⏎ Could you guide me on how to set this up?
Feb 16 11:32:29 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well it was long ago that I set this up
Feb 16 11:32:40 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I see that I used `subfile` to import files in the mainfile
Feb 16 11:33:20 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So it does not work when you activate reftex-mode manually in the Latex buffer?
Feb 16 11:33:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I find it should get activated automatically (there is a hook in the layer)
Feb 16 11:33:44 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I had not gone this far last time I tried
Feb 16 11:33:55 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I will try and let you know
Feb 16 11:34:02 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes good...
Feb 16 11:34:05 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> How do you activate the reftex-mode manually?
Feb 16 11:34:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes
Feb 16 11:34:51 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> And now it seems to get activated automatically
Feb 16 11:35:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So I had to do it manually only once (which seems weird to me, but it was the case here)
Feb 16 11:36:22 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I get that in a `.tex` buffer I need to press `SPC m r` to get in the `reftex` menu. But what do I need to do once there?
Feb 16 11:36:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> just type `SPC SPC reftex-mode`
Feb 16 11:37:34 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Apparently it was activated by default
Feb 16 11:37:52 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> But still I don't get any suggestion when typing in my `\cite{...}`
Feb 16 11:37:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah yeah... well that is how it should work
Feb 16 11:38:18 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> am I missing something?
Feb 16 11:38:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well I am not sure why it did not work the last time here, maybe because I just installed the latex layer
Feb 16 11:38:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> And then just reopened the file
Feb 16 11:38:51 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I must explain that I'm typing this `\cite{...}` command in a `.tex` file that does not contain a bib explicitely
Feb 16 11:39:18 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> but in a auxialiary `.tex` file that is called (via `\input{}`) in the main `.tex` file
Feb 16 11:39:29 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Anyway... now I restarted Emacs, to see if I had again to activate `reftex-mode` manually, and now completion does not work
Feb 16 11:39:41 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Did you understand this subtlety?
Feb 16 11:39:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > but in a auxialiary `.tex` file that is called (via `\input{}`) in the main `.tex` file ⏎  ⏎ Yes I have a similar situation
Feb 16 11:39:58 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Great
Feb 16 11:40:15 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> So something is definitely working as intended, right?
Feb 16 11:40:50 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah right
Feb 16 11:41:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah, okay
Feb 16 11:42:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> When I typed `\cite{` I saw in the minibuffer a hint which said this
Feb 16 11:42:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> `cite: info not available, use ‘, R v’ to get it.`
Feb 16 11:42:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> after typing `, R v` things work
Feb 16 11:44:11 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I still get a `Cannot display crossref` message after doing what you just described
Feb 16 11:44:37 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah... I can not reproduce it here too
Feb 16 11:44:54 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> what do you mean?
Feb 16 11:45:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well I restarted spacemacs... and tried it again
Feb 16 11:45:15 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But now it did work
Feb 16 11:45:27 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I had typed first part of some reference and put my cursor in it
Feb 16 11:45:35 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> did or did not?
Feb 16 11:45:41 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> ok I will try restarting spacemacs
Feb 16 11:45:45 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> It did work
Feb 16 11:46:45 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah... my god... the first time it loaded my .bib file and then completion worked
Feb 16 11:46:54 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I tried restarting but it did not work
Feb 16 11:46:57 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> maybe I should update?
Feb 16 11:47:09 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But now after `, R v` it does load the some bib file, but completion still does not work
Feb 16 11:47:20 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Hahaha
Feb 16 11:48:06 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well updating is nice anyway, because many small improvements get implemented all the time
Feb 16 11:48:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> You are on develop branch?
Feb 16 11:48:19 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> yes
Feb 16 11:48:33 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> do I just need to pull the latest develop branch?
Feb 16 11:48:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes
Feb 16 11:48:42 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> will do
Feb 16 11:48:58 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> And then after that click the update packages button on your home screen
Feb 16 11:54:52 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I did all of what you described but I'm stuck with the `Cannot display crossref` message
Feb 16 11:55:33 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I need to go away from the screen for an hour or two. Will come back here and would be glad to debug it then :)
Feb 16 11:55:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> but when you type `\cite{lksjfslkfj}` and put your cursor on between the brackets in normal mode, do you see this message?
Feb 16 11:55:53 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> to type `, R v`
Feb 16 11:56:02 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> yes I do
Feb 16 11:56:21 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> And when you type `, R v` some bibtex file gets loaded?
Feb 16 11:56:35 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> the `Cannot display crossref` happens right after I press `, R v`
Feb 16 11:56:46 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Apparently not
Feb 16 11:56:53 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah okay
Feb 16 11:57:27 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> As an intermediate step I will try getting the `crossref` working on the `main.tex` file. I had not tried that
Feb 16 11:57:38 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So I simply have these lines in my `main.tex` file
Feb 16 11:58:14 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> ```\usepackage[backend=biber, backref=true]{biblatex} ⏎ \addbibresource{bibtex.bib}``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=602ba551dc108172e77dd294]
Feb 16 11:59:24 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I'm using a template so I don't have these lines (I think)
Feb 16 11:59:47 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I'm using the `\usepackage[numbers,sort,compress]{natbib}` package but I think this is unrelated
Feb 16 12:00:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> B.t.w., the correct bib file gets loaded, but when trying to autocomplete it says, `no matches`
Feb 16 12:00:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> While I can just read the correct citation from the bib file
Feb 16 12:00:58 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> This is my code at the bottom of my `main.tex` file. `1.bib` is a valid `bibtex` file ⏎  ⏎ ```{\small ⏎ \bibliographystyle{ieee_fullname} ⏎ \bibliography{1} ⏎ }``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=602ba5f57ba8124e546b3a99]
Feb 16 12:01:15 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But your project needs to know where is your bib file
Feb 16 12:01:19 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I guess
Feb 16 12:01:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> somehow
Feb 16 12:01:31 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> hmmm, not sure what you mean by that
Feb 16 12:01:41 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> my `1.bib` is in the `root` of my project
Feb 16 12:01:52 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> same level as `main.tex`
Feb 16 12:01:54 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> BUT
Feb 16 12:01:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah... still I guess you need to add something like this
Feb 16 12:02:08 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> I have the separate input files in a dedicated folder (`sections`)
Feb 16 12:02:22 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Therefore they don't have direct access to the `.bib` (it's one folder up the tree)
Feb 16 12:02:48 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Could be this issue, yes
Feb 16 12:02:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I guess you still have to add somewhere some line like this one ⏎ `\addbibresource{bibtex.bib}`
Feb 16 12:03:03 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> would you advise me to symlink the `.bib` in the section?
Feb 16 12:03:05 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> in which file?
Feb 16 12:03:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> with the correct path to your .bib file of course
Feb 16 12:03:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> > in which file? ⏎  ⏎ I would say in your main file... or the template
Feb 16 12:03:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Mine is in my main file
Feb 16 12:03:50 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Ok that makes sense
Feb 16 12:05:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> You should check out the bibtex layer and ebib (http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/) btw
Feb 16 12:05:52 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Probably nicer than using some external bibtex manager
Feb 16 12:07:02 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Ok I think I will need to dive deeper into this
Feb 16 12:07:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah me too
Feb 16 12:07:40 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> seems like I don't have the `biblatex` package you are using
Feb 16 12:07:45 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> Therefore I get an error
Feb 16 12:08:01 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> and cannot use `\addbibresource{mybib.bib}`
Feb 16 12:08:22 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> As I said I have to go, but talk to you later!
Feb 16 12:08:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> It seems in most examples this is not used ⏎ `\addbibresource{bibtex.bib}`
Feb 16 12:08:38 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I think they also do not say where to put the .bib file
Feb 16 12:08:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> (probably it should be in the root ofthe project, but tutorials should mention this)
Feb 16 12:09:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Well, I went just looking for it quickly of course
Feb 16 12:09:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah see you later!
Feb 16 12:13:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @inzouzouwetrust Maybe check this out... https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5091/what-to-do-to-switch-to-biblatex
Feb 16 12:21:31 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @inzouzouwetrust This (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3063189/autocompleting-cite-with-emacs-auctex-gives-cite-no-such-database-entry) indeed does work for me
Feb 16 12:22:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> So I can search the citation using a regex
Feb 16 12:22:59 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But still I wonder, how the `TAB` completion worked the first time
Feb 16 12:24:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> After I insert some item the first time using `C-c [`, then subsequently `TAB` completion works for that item too
Feb 16 12:30:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> so `C-c [` is equivalent to `, R c` in normal mode or `M-RET R c` in insert mode
Feb 16 12:34:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Alternatively you can use `helm-bibtex` or `ivy-bibtex` from the bibtex layer
Feb 16 12:35:33 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I remember my citations got automatically checked at some point... so that does not seem to work anymore

Feb 17 09:17:42 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> @dalanicolai Here's a follow-up on our discussion from yesterday: ⏎ I went for a (ugly) fix that consists in setting an `org-ref-default-bibliography` in my `dotspacemacs/user-config` that contains ALL my references (used for several different papers) therefore I have access to all my references from any `.tex` file. ⏎ The issue with this is that I use a project dependent `.bib` file therefore some 
Feb 17 09:17:42 <FromGitter>	... entries that are available in my ALL references `.bib` may not be in my project dependent `.bib`. It requires a double-check on my hand but it already makes my life easier. ⏎ Thanks for stepping in! [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=602cd1269403f11bb58abdd1]

Feb 17 11:14:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @jr0cket I quickly had a look, but markdown-mode seems to work fine here (looks like all major mode bindings are available). I synced with the latest develop branch and restarted Spacemacs before checking it.
Feb 17 11:19:46 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @inzouzouwetrust Haha, sounds ugly indeed... I would say Spacemacs should be able to determine your project file somehow, it does here at least. And I guess you can still use `, Rc` or `helm-bibtex`.  Anyway, good luck with the fix...
Feb 17 12:37:34 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> ok so I'm fairly new to this DAP layer in spacemacs, I have no idea how it works, the documentations doesn't shed much light, so does anyone here can briefly guide through like what I need, how do I set it up, and what config should I have?

Feb 17 12:40:17 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> I'm presented with a temporary buffer after I press `SPC d d e` and I'm greeted with this ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=602d00a09337c51bc690f691]
Feb 17 12:40:27 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> I did try editing a couple of things to see if it would work
Feb 17 12:40:35 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> but apparently it doesnt
Feb 17 12:40:50 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> I installed gdb btw and I'm running on Arch Linux

Feb 17 12:57:09 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> hmmmm yes ⏎  ⏎ > dap-mode introduces the notion of debug configuration and debug template. The debug configuration is the settings that are needed by the debug adapter to start the program to debug. Debug template is a template for such configuration which will be populated by the user or by dap-mode. There are two ways to manage debug configuration - using emacs lisp via dap-debug-edit-template and 
Feb 17 12:57:09 <FromGitter>	... dap-register-debug-template. The second way is using launch.json. Put it in project root and dap-mode will pick it up.
Feb 17 12:57:28 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> dap-register-debug-template command not found
Feb 17 13:00:25 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> @yyoncho apparently your documentation is a bit lets see out of date
Feb 17 13:00:49 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> aaaaaand it is too vague for people who hasn't used it before to understand
Feb 17 13:01:21 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> well I'd love to write a simple up to date documentation about it after I know how to use it
Feb 17 13:01:33 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> because I find that its lacking a bit of documentation
Feb 17 13:03:08 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> can you explain a bit about what `"program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/emacs",` is and what `"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",` is?
Feb 17 13:03:46 <FromGitter>	<epixinvites> and pls `dap-register-debug-template` isn't found

Feb 23 12:54:34 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> greetings, probably a noobish question: in emacs lisp, how do i choose a different value if one value is nil? e.g. `(choose-non-nil (could-evaluate-to-nil) (always-non-nil))`. ⏎ For context, Im trying to handle an optional argument for a function.
Feb 23 12:56:51 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> @iliekprogrammar I guess you are looking for `or`?
Feb 23 12:57:36 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> oh it works like in lua. quite nice.
Feb 23 12:58:09 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah... don't know lua
Feb 23 12:59:09 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> it's a neat language. I learnt it for neovim's new support for lua configurations.
Feb 23 13:00:09 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> but the way emacs' built is just miles better than lua support
Feb 23 13:00:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah I quickly had a look at lua, when I read positive things about it
Feb 23 13:01:17 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I think I remember it looked like python, just little less nice
Feb 23 13:01:54 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> metatables sold it for me
Feb 23 13:02:24 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yeah... the introspection in emacs is great. And lisp is a beautiful language too
Feb 23 13:03:00 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> never would i have ever thought to love parenthesis abuse
Feb 23 13:04:06 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha... maybe it is not abuse after all
Feb 23 13:05:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I quickly searched for `metatable`... from the explanation in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatable) it sounds like lisp is all metatable...
Feb 23 13:06:07 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But I do not really know what I am talking about... just the 'holding data that acts as source code' part
Feb 23 13:07:41 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> in lua, it basically means you change how operations interact with the object/table. ⏎  ⏎ say i want union operation for sets. I can override the + operator using metatables.
Feb 23 13:09:06 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> the table holds the data, acting as the source code, that defines its behaviour.
Feb 23 13:09:21 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> pretty OOP-like, really
Feb 23 13:09:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah... I have read that lisp offers plenty of tricks for that I think... but I still need to learn those tricks
Feb 23 13:11:29 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> another way to use metatable is to create builders or prototypes
Feb 23 13:12:11 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha... okay I still need to learn a lot... I am only a hobby programmer
Feb 23 13:12:26 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> but of course, the thing that people remember most about lua is that its 1-indexed
Feb 23 13:13:02 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> and many fail to hint the fact that metatables can change that to the more sensible 2-indexed system
Feb 23 13:13:53 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Ah don't know what that means
Feb 23 13:14:05 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I thought you meant 1 vs 0-indexed
Feb 23 13:14:10 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> But 2-indexed?
Feb 23 13:14:17 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> yes, that's correct
Feb 23 13:14:27 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> metatables results in any-indexed
Feb 23 13:14:58 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Haha sounds confuding
Feb 23 13:14:58 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> truly a powerful feature :D
Feb 23 13:16:19 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> I will believe you on your word :)
Feb 23 13:17:25 <FromGitter>	<iliekprogrammar> i wonder what cursed things you can do in lisp, given how simple and flexible this beast is
Feb 23 13:20:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai> Yes... me too... but I have seen some sophisticated looking code already... I wish I had understood it also

Feb 26 16:30:42 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> `SPC f d` does not do the job?
Feb 26 16:31:20 <FromGitter>	<fran-penedo> I don't have `SPC f d` bound, what's the name of the function for you?
Feb 26 16:31:55 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> `helm-projectile-find-dir`
Feb 26 16:33:59 <FromGitter>	<fran-penedo> oh, I should have clarified, what I'd like is exactly that but in directories that do not belong to a project
Feb 26 16:36:46 <FromGitter>	<inzouzouwetrust> haha then I don't know, sorry
Feb 26 16:39:01 <FromGitter>	<henriquenj> long ago I used `find-name-dired` for this, but it's not really fuzzy search I am afraid...
Feb 26 16:39:43 <FromGitter>	<henriquenj> It is basically the "find" command but within emacs
Feb 26 16:41:51 <FromGitter>	<fran-penedo> I guess I'll bind `helm-dir-do-ag` with `-g ` already written to something for now
Feb 26 16:48:13 <FromGitter>	<henriquenj> If you want to find recursively by content you can use `SPC s d`, but it does not use file nmes
Feb 26 16:50:35 <FromGitter>	<fran-penedo> yeah, that one I knew about, it's file names I'm specifically after. I tend to end up in random system directories that do not form a project and looking for a file that I remember the name (mostly) but not exactly where they're at
Feb 26 17:37:06 <FromGitter>	<pscollins> hi all -- after a recent upgrade, i notice that `C-g` closes `*compilation*` buffers that result from a `SPC c r`. is it possible to disable this behavior?
Feb 26 17:49:44 <FromGitter>	<pscollins> looking through commits, it seems like `popwin` is the culprit, but i don't have `popwin-mode` enabled
