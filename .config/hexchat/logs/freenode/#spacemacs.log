With my largely default Spacemacs config, it seems to load a repeat of the window setup from another frame? Or something like that, at least...

Jun 14 09:50:57 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I don't think layers starting with `spacemacs-*` need to be added manually, they are probably loaded by default. ⏎ They might be intended for the Spacemacs base distribution, then one can add Spacemacs features selectively.
Jun 14 10:03:20 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> I did a clean install
Jun 14 10:03:47 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> autocompletion in `SPC f f` and movements in there are still not working like on my other machines. But at least iedit works now
Jun 14 10:04:47 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Is the auto completion issue `cannot split side window...`, it's a known issue.
Jun 14 10:07:11 <FromGitter>	<duianto> If that's your issue, then this seems to be the workaround: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ source: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/7446#issuecomment-417376425 [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5d036446fbcc305cc46aad4d]
Jun 14 10:08:43 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> No. I use `TAB` to autocomplete on my other machines. Here it opens some  and `RET` is the autocompletion. But I think I found the problem
Jun 14 10:09:26 <FromGitter>	<weidtn> Seems like `better-defaults` was also not properly installed. And in my clean install I did not uncomment it. Now it works

Jun 14 15:07:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Emacs does see it yes.
Jun 14 15:09:45 <FromGitter>	<tian-yi> and in the issues comment you mentioned, I think spacmacs already using `exec-path-from-shell` for osx, I also tried to add this ` (setq-default counsel-ag-base-command "/usr/local/bin/ag --vimgrep --nocolor --nogroup %s")` to `user-init` didn't work :(

Jun 14 20:46:08 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> @patzhang oh nice, it worked, but what is want is delete in vim without overwriting your last yank :(
Jun 14 20:46:17 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @huyhoang8398 There's an open PR that solves that issue: ⏎ osx: add option to separate OSX pasteboard from kill-ring #9344 ⏎ I don't have a mac so I can't test it, and there seems to be an open question to resolve.
Jun 14 20:46:18 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> im reading the link @duianto
Jun 14 20:58:54 <FromGitter>	<huyhoang8398> @duianto well, i tried all but non of these work, so i still looking for  another answer for "way to delete in vim without overwriting your last yank in MacOS", for now i will stick with `SPC r y` from @patzhang  thank you guy
Jun 14 21:43:30 <FromGitter>	<capsulecorplab> Hell spacemacs users, for any orgmode users here, is there a trick to getting deadlines and scheduled tasks to show in agenda view (SPC a o a)?

Jun 16 21:17:00 <FromGitter>	<imgulyas> yea I tried that as well. After a few hours of tryin I got it to work, basically I removed all workspace folders previously seen by metal and then I opened a .scala file in the project and it automagically restarted itself. But I still don't know how to manually start it after a shutdown.

Jul 11 13:40:31 <FromGitter>	<kaaninho> Hello, I got a rather specific question to the `clojure` layer. Hope, I am not totally wrong here.  Suppose I have a working REPL with `cider-jack-in`, if i type a function call like `(my-fun 3  ` the Mini Buffer shows the signature of the function `my-function`, like `namespace/myfun : ([first second third])`. It does -however- not highlight, that its the `second` argument, that I have to supply. I think, in the 
Jul 11 13:40:31 <FromGitter>	... past, There was some highlighting of that. Does any one know of a way to fix this?
Jul 11 14:37:29 <FromGitter>	<samhedin> Is there a way to get syntax highlighting working in org mode src-code blocks with Dockerfiles/docker-compose.yml files? `#+begin_src docker [...] #+end_src` does not seem to do it
Jul 11 15:26:53 <FromGitter>	<nhmacuk> Did someone notice the following problem in org-mode?:  using "<N>" to  limit column width doesn't seem to work in spacemacs developers version 0.300.0 on emacs 26.2 (see column normal column width behaviour on https://orgmode.org/manual/Column-width-and-alignment.html). Haven't been able to find an issue about it yet. If more people have this problem I shall raise the issue.
Jul 11 15:57:39 <FromGitter>	<DuncanBetts> If I want to install some package like http://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/#org793bea5 do I follow the normal installation instructions, or create a layer?
Jul 11 15:59:01 <FromGitter>	<DuncanBetts> I suppose my question should be, can I just follow the normal procedure. And now I've asked it, I've realized I should just try.

Oct 11 16:13:24 <FromGitter>	<TK997> @duianto so as you can see on pictures
Oct 11 16:13:33 <FromGitter>	<TK997> one line has 16 chars, the other has 4 chars
Oct 11 16:13:54 <FromGitter>	<TK997> I tried using indent but no use... I always come to 16 chars
Oct 11 16:14:01 <FromGitter>	<TK997> the rest of the lines all have 4 chars
Oct 11 16:15:50 <FromGitter>	<TK997> how can I fix that? I thought maybe adding something in  ⏎ .spacemacs ?
Oct 11 16:16:04 <FromGitter>	<TK997> I enabled the python layer for spacemacs tho
Oct 11 16:17:21 <mroh>	try "C-x h" "M-C-\"

Oct 11 16:20:26 <FromGitter>	<TK997> So I found out that my Tab is jump up for 4 orange dots
Oct 11 16:20:35 <FromGitter>	<TK997> it's practically same as me hitting space
Oct 11 16:20:44 <FromGitter>	<TK997> how do I fix that?
Oct 11 16:23:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Maybe there's a simpler method, but I guess you could select a tab (one set of double arrows) or four spaces, and use iedit `SPC s e` to edit all of them so that they use the same type of indentation.
Oct 11 16:25:42 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Tab is set to toggle the current iedit occurrence (at least on the `develop` branch), so you'll have to press `C-q TAB` to insert a tab.
Oct 11 16:25:45 <FromGitter>	<TK997> don't know how to use the above mentioned

Oct 18 16:17:32 <mrig>	Do you guys use ag or grep in your spacmacs setups?
Oct 18 16:18:03 <mrig>	MarconSantana, not yet but I will be looking into it.
Oct 18 16:18:49 <FromGitter>	<MarcoSantana> @FromIRC Yes ag
Oct 18 16:19:40 <mrig>	I was wondering what the advantages of it are over grep, I see that you can open the list of results as if it were file, is this specific to ag?
Oct 18 16:22:21 <mrig>	Do I need to change the order of the list in my .spacemacs file to get ag to override grep?
Oct 18 16:23:33 <mrig>	or is this to be installed on the os perhaps?
Oct 18 16:24:30 <mrig>	ohhhh the silver searcher :O
Oct 18 16:25:33 <mrig>	:D love this stuff <3
Oct 18 16:32:17 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i was using ack, but moved to ag recently and its good
Oct 18 16:32:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> considering ripgrep too
Oct 18 16:32:52 <mrig>	nice to be able to edit the result set in a transient state buffer, pretty slick.
Oct 18 16:33:00 <mrig>	Very fast too.
Oct 18 16:33:08 <mrig>	how is ripgrep?
Oct 18 16:33:16 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> supposed to be the fastest
Oct 18 16:33:19 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> built in rust
Oct 18 16:33:26 <mrig>	ah ok.
Oct 18 16:33:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i haven't used it yet, i think the integration with spacemacs was relatively new last time i was looking.  but it has been a while since then
Oct 18 16:34:00 <mrig>	Yes makes sense, I see that ag is written in c, so lightning fast.
Oct 18 16:34:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> yeah ag was the fastest i was aware of before ripgrep (rg)
Oct 18 16:34:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i switched to ag when working on some very large projects
Oct 18 16:34:44 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> helps with the `SPC /` searching
Oct 18 16:34:46 <mrig>	grep is amazing code though, amazing history.
Oct 18 16:35:21 <mrig>	just learning about iedit, that is very nice too.
Oct 18 16:35:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i never knew much about it.  i went into Emacs world early on in my CLI days and was always looking for an Emacs solution to things
Oct 18 16:35:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> my usual use of grep is `ps aux | grep foo`
Oct 18 16:35:56 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> or `apt search | grep foo`
Oct 18 16:36:01 <mrig>	Oh yes Spc / is way faster.
Oct 18 16:36:25 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> still haven't ever used iedit
Oct 18 16:36:28 <mrig>	I use it alot in the terminal yes.
Oct 18 16:36:48 <mrig>	seems nice for selective refactoring, function by function.
Oct 18 16:40:28 <FromGitter>	<apj68> BTW, if anyone has time for a stackexchange contribution, I posted a "how do I do evil-mc" question (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/53212/how-can-i-use-evil-mc-in-spacemacs).
Oct 18 16:41:51 <FromGitter>	<apj68> I've done a bit with `iedit`, it's pretty cool and seems like a good compliment to `evil-mc` hence I'm trying to figure it out
Oct 18 16:42:04 <FromGitter>	<apj68> (`evil-mc`, that is)
Oct 18 16:45:39 <FromGitter>	<apj68> @brorbw , try `SPC`-`ve` then begin your edit.  Optionally, after `v` you could alter the scope before starting your edit.
Oct 18 17:02:12 <mrig>	sorry has to be done : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHOrpFeXUao&app=desktop

Oct 20 00:30:02 <FromGitter>	<zjp> (if (package-installed-p 'ein) [duplicated code]) doesn't feel right

Oct 20 16:22:26 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> how can I find out which variables I can set on a layer?
Oct 20 16:36:21 <enikar>	reading the layer document can help a lot. In the spacemacs home buffer, select `[Search in spacemacs]', then select the layer of your choice.
Oct 20 16:37:03 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> thank you!
Oct 20 16:38:07 <mroh>	also, source helps: the layers variables are in the config.el file of the layer
Oct 20 16:39:20 <FromGitter>	<yellowmoneybank> ah I see! I dont know much about elisp, but its not too hard to figure out though :)
Oct 20 16:40:24 <FromGitter>	<Compro-Prasad> Just like Emacs is better vim than vim, its also better Google than Google.
Oct 20 16:40:56 <mroh>	hehe, for emacs stuff, for sure ^^
Oct 20 16:41:18 <enikar>	before, I can select the documentation's layer with `SPC d l` or something like that. It doesn't work any more… `SPC d` shows me only one binding with b for browse-docs-online-at-point.
Oct 20 16:42:31 <enikar>	It seems to be an issue… For the moment I use emacs without spacemacs, I didn't notice that.
Oct 20 16:45:09 <enikar>	never mind. I was wrong, this `SPC h l` to access documentation layers.
Oct 20 16:51:23 <FromGitter>	<MinallWch> Hello spacemacs!

Oct 20 21:50:52 <FromGitter>	<MintStudios> @duianto Installation is succesful. Where would I install the Source Code Pro font?
Oct 20 21:56:54 <FromGitter>	<MintStudios> or anyone else
Oct 20 21:57:58 <FromGitter>	<duianto> It's just a standard windows font installation. You download the fonts: ⏎ `source-code-pro-2.030R-ro-1.050R-it.zip` from here: ⏎ https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/tag/2.030R-ro%2F1.050R-it ⏎  ⏎ And extract the files temporarily. I think I used the `ttf` files, you can probably select all .ttf font files, right click and choose install. [https://g
Oct 20 21:57:58 <FromGitter>	... itter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5dacca690fdc4b65072320b3]
Oct 20 22:00:06 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Yes, I've got the `ttf` files installed. Windows might support some or even all of the other formats but at least the `ttf` files do work.
Oct 20 22:01:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> When the fonts are installed then you can delete the extracted directory, the font's have been installed somewhere else. Probably in a windows directory.

Jan 02 17:19:56 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` https://i.imgur.com/sbw4FbI.png
Jan 02 17:31:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> qurqar - what are you seeing at startup?  there's also `dotspacemacs-maximized-at-startup` variable that could be affecting it
Jan 02 17:32:50 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` It opens maximized, let me see
Jan 02 17:35:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: The position and size also changes for me with that command in PopOS 19.10.
Jan 02 17:37:06 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` ok the maximized was set, now the code works but I also need to use this on Windows and different screen sizes. Is it posible to work with percentages instead of pixels?
Jan 02 17:43:46 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri I'll make that little fix. How about I also add a function to find the current channels log file, that is, for easier switching to log file?

Jan 02 17:46:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> sounds great :) i keep meaning to use ERC more ... unfortunately i spend most of my time in slack xP @mphojele
Jan 02 17:50:01 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` duianto (Gitter): thanks, except that I know donkey poop about how to set all that, just started using emacs :(
Jan 02 17:50:16 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` I am at the copy paste stage yet

[https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e1f7929e8167dcf73e756]
Jan 02 17:52:01 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I'm going afk for a little bit, but if someone else hasn't found an answer, then I can take a look.
Jan 02 17:52:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri slack is a irc client?
Jan 02 17:53:22 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` duianto (Gitter):  thanks, just looking for a code snippet that can keep teh rough size of the preset emacs window size across devices
Jan 02 17:53:40 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> slack is not an irc client afaik.  its just bloated electron chat app that i have to use at work
Jan 02 17:54:11 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` the previous snippet is good for a single monitor but I am sharing .spacemacs across 4 devices , that would drive one crazy on different devices
Jan 02 18:10:51 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> so the erc layer has these mode bindings: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ Any suggestions on the key I could use for the function that finds the current channels log file? [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e241b0fd3413f4c961c20]
Jan 02 19:30:33 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar, If a difference between the devices can be detected, then you can have specific positions and sizes for each device.
Jan 02 19:35:52 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @mphojele - I'd say either `"v"` for view channel logs or maybe `"c"` for "current channel logs"  ?
Jan 02 19:57:13 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @gcentauri  I was thinking `"L"` since I believe it'll be less used and you wouldn't want to easily opening the log file by mistake
Jan 02 19:59:37 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> 👍 also good. i forget about the caps sometimes :)
Jan 02 20:02:33 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> you forget that bindings can be uppercase or you forget to type commands that are uppercase?
Jan 02 20:04:16 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> both
Jan 02 20:04:23 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i don't like pressing shift xD
Jan 02 20:08:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Yeah! I also forget type uppercase sometimes. I'm putting the command on `"c"`, if somebody feels it's unconventional they'll motivate why because we got our on back up story now. So the code is working as intended...
Jan 02 20:09:35 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Now it's the hard part left... Figuring out a intuitive commit message...
Jan 02 20:10:29 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> it is such a challenge sometimes. only 80c!
Jan 02 20:13:14 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Especially, when like me, you always have a lot to say and different ways of saying it
Jan 02 20:33:07 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` > <@gitter_duianto:matrix.org> qurqar, If a difference between the devices can be detected, then you can have specific positions and sizes for each device. ⏎  ⏎ I am sure it is possible, but I know jackshieet about lisp and emacs in general
Jan 02 20:35:58 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: Here are two possible methods for detecting the primary monitor size or the OS. ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e461e2640a676295a0e73]
Jan 02 20:36:56 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> And there is the (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/pull/13147)[fix]
Jan 02 20:37:16 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: The `(message ...` lines (except the last parenthesis can be replaced modify-frame-parameters command.
Jan 02 20:38:28 <FromGitter>	<duianto> There I added the closing parenthesis after the messages line, now it's easier to replace the messages line with the modify-frame parameters command.
Jan 02 20:38:36 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar`
Jan 02 20:39:00 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Although it might also work to use these commands in stead: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ to set the Emacs frame position and size. [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e0e46d4e10e9a722544a2ef]
Jan 02 20:39:38 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The `t` at the end of frame size means that the numbers are specified in pixels.
Jan 02 20:39:52 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The position doesn't need a t, it's probably in pixels by default
Jan 02 20:40:22 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Yes, it's in pixels.
Jan 02 20:43:34 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` thanks I will paly around with these
Jan 02 20:44:06 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar` also you recommended to put in the user-init block, is there a separate file that I can edit instead, to keep things nice and neay
Jan 02 20:44:12 <FromGitter>	<matrixbot> `qurqar`  * also you recommended to put in the user-init block, is there a separate file that I can edit instead, to keep things nice and neat
Jan 02 20:46:22 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I haven't loaded an external file from my `.spacemacs` but it seems like that should work. Maybe someone else in here knows how to do it?
Jan 02 20:49:21 <FromGitter>	<duianto> qurqar: This sounds like what your looking for: ⏎ http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/organize_your_dot_emacs.html
Jan 02 20:50:08 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The tutorial is referring to the default Emacs `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file, but it should work fine with the Spacemacs `~/.spacemacs` file.
Jan 02 22:17:00 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> 💡 You know what would be great? if we added a way to alternate between the windows transient state (`SPC w .`) and the navigation transient state (`SPC N`). Awesome right?! I know.
Jan 02 22:19:17 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> like a key in each transient to switch to the other?
Jan 02 22:19:27 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i didn't even know about those states xD
Jan 02 22:24:38 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> Yes. The cool thing here is that theses transient states work persisently, meaning running any command within the state keeps you in the state unless you explicitly quit the state with `q` usually.
Jan 02 22:26:57 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The Layouts Transient State `SPC l` (lowercase L) has `w` for switching to the Workspaces Transient State, which in turn has `l` (lowercase L) for switching back. So there's a precedence for that kind of behavior.
Jan 02 22:35:08 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> @duianto oh yes, so I'll find out how they implemented that, and hopefully replicate it. Actually, another 💡 turned on...
Jan 02 22:35:15 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> 😆
Jan 02 22:37:37 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> How about change all these states? Meaning you can move from Layouts, Workspaces, Windows and Navigation states in web form. Each one is accessible from the other...
Jan 02 22:39:46 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> sounds like One Transient To Rule Them All
Jan 02 22:48:33 <FromGitter>	<mphojele> I think I'm too bored 🤦 😆 Anyways, I'm going to head on and knit this web

Jan 22 10:39:27 <FromGitter>	<vipenzo> @duianto Thanks very much. As a general question: how to you map documentation for emacs to spacemacs ? I mean, I found this page https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FrameSize explaining how to set frame geometry in "initial-frame-alist" option but I wasn't able to find it in the spacemacs configurationd docs. Are they separate worlds ?
Jan 22 10:42:26 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Hi all,  how would I go about refreshing the magit buffer when I focus the window again? I tried doing it like this: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` ⏎  ⏎ but when I open magit it is a blank buffer.  ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e28191a42ae383fa967bcbb]
Jan 22 11:29:01 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @vipenzo Spacemacs is Emacs with configurations.
Jan 22 11:30:03 <FromGitter>	<duianto> @TotNotTac `g r` calls `magit-refresh`
Jan 22 11:31:55 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Or you probably ment automatically using elisp.
Jan 22 11:45:33 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yes
Jan 22 11:46:20 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> There's no hook for window switching right?
Jan 22 11:50:29 <FromGitter>	<duianto> Test with `advice-add`, this quick test seems to work: ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e28290c258edf397bc8b458]
Jan 22 11:50:54 <FromGitter>	<duianto> The last line is just if you want to remove the advice while testing.
Jan 22 11:59:53 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Hmm the advice works, and the function runs but it seems to mess up when magit-refresh runs
Jan 22 12:04:27 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I saw this comment that states that `select-window` can run potentially thousands of times in a single command: https://stackoverflow.com/a/20936510 ⏎ The suggestion there is to use `post-command-hook` instead.
Jan 22 12:06:07 <FromGitter>	<duianto> I added a counter to the scratch-msg and by just opening the `SPC` which-key popup it counts to 38.
Jan 22 12:10:44 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> 😱
Jan 22 12:10:46 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yeah I dont want that
Jan 22 12:16:58 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> Yeah it ran 34 times for me  as well
Jan 22 12:19:03 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> But post-command-hook makes it run every time you do anything :p
Jan 22 12:19:10 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> for example, move your cursor
Jan 22 12:19:36 <FromGitter>	<duianto> yeah that sounds worse.
Jan 22 12:23:49 <FromGitter>	<TotNotTac> I can try to use select-window again to store the last active major mode and only run magit-refresh if the mode is something else than a magit related mode

Jan 22 16:32:32 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> DuClare - i'm not sure there is one by default... if you use vanilla bindings you can do `C-u -1 M-u` but thats not much better.  `M-b M-u` will do it too, so I'd suggest defining your own function to be a combo of the commands needed to do the upcasing

Feb 19 12:43:23 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @maciej-bendkowski just for the record - I would not use treemacs to pick a single file. I usually use it if I want to see the structure of the project. If you want to open a I file I would use SPC p f/SPC p r
Feb 19 12:43:52 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> and sometimes vinegar layer
Feb 19 13:24:05 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @maciej-bendkowski I was suggesting using Layouts instead of Treemacs, as it seemed you only used it to switch between projects.  As mentioned above, the `SPC p f` is very useful and I find it more effective.  Layouts keep project views isolated.
Feb 19 13:25:37 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I don't find Treemacs or Neotree that useful.  I occasionally use ranger, `SPC a r`, to browse through projects, as it is fast and has a file preview.
Feb 19 13:26:38 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> You can also do some amazing things with helm.

Feb 29 15:58:47 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> @Martinsos sorry, I didn't find it clear why you want to run Emacs in a terminal.  It is just because you are doing Git on the command line? You can configure `.spacemacs` to run a persistent server, there is specific entries for this already.  You can configure `.gitconfig` to use `emacsclient` as it's editor, so if you don't specify a message, then `emacsclient` will be used to open a buffer in Emacs instantly.  
Feb 29 15:58:47 <FromGitter>	... If it's only for got, you could instead use Magit.  Add the `git` layer to `.spacemacs` and use `SPC g s` to open git status, from where you can stage, commit, pull, push, etc.
Feb 29 16:01:16 <FromGitter>	<jr0cket> I always have Emacs running, so it never takes any time to start.
Feb 29 16:37:51 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> Thanks all -> it is normally for some quick git stuff (I still find it easier to do it from terminal than magit) or to edit some file real quickly if I am already at it in terminal. ⏎ Ok, so you are all suggesting doing it via daemon -> I will try that more than, I was having issues with it but I am sure there is a way to get it working properly. Thanks!
Feb 29 16:39:01 <FromGitter>	<mitchell-horning> @mitchell-horning Mischief manage, my question was answered in the lispy readme. There is a larger problem that where lispy-mode's map is lower in precedence than evil's, so evil has quashed some important keybindings. I will likely manually remap, but a way to specify minor mode keymap precedence might be nice
Feb 29 16:48:55 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> @ANGkeith I did as you said, and daemon is running, however I get following behaviour: emacsclient -nw is still doing some loading (snippets and some stuff), so I still have to wait couple of seconds until I can start using spacemacs. I tried opening another emacsclient -nw at the same time, and that one turned on immediatelly. However, when I tried to close that second one, it also closed the first one! Each 
Feb 29 16:48:55 <FromGitter>	... those was in different terminal. So I am not sure what is the benefit of daemon if it behaves like this hm! Or maybe they are not really using daemon? I checked with `ps` and I see daemon running. ⏎ Here is my service file (it came with emacs installation, I am on arch, emacs version 26.3 . ⏎  ⏎ ```code paste, see link` ... [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e5a87e7ca2f5a558d5942e3]
Feb 29 16:53:13 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> I can't even stop the daemon, I tried running `systemctl stop --user emacs` and now there is process `emacsclient --eval (kill-emacs)` that is just stuck.
Feb 29 16:53:44 <FromGitter>	<Martinsos> actually it seems it killed it now, after 2 minutes
Feb 29 17:21:53 <FromGitter>	<aeschylus> Hi All.

Feb 29 17:27:14 <FromGitter>	<nixmaniack> @aeschylus You can add that in your `~/.spacemacs` file in the `dotspacemacs/user-config` section/function.
Feb 29 17:30:55 <FromGitter>	<aeschylus> @nixmaniack Gracias!
Feb 29 18:03:15 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> How can I remap Helm's mini buffer help menu ```C-c ?``` to ```C-c m```? The default ```C-c ?``` does not work on my language/keyboard. The mapped function is ```helm-help```. You can see a list of all functions by pressing ```C-c```inside a helm mini buffer and then wait for menu to pop up.

Mar 02 14:34:22 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Wilk, yes that seems like the problem. Emacs 26.1 deprecated when-let, seems like the Vue layer is still using it?
Mar 02 14:45:50 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Maybe it's somewhere else. I have only been on my phone and haven't been able to look closely at what is calling it
Mar 02 14:58:18 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> Wilk - what version of spacemacs are you using?
Mar 02 15:06:49 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> i'm not sure, oddly, when-let is still defined for me, and the place in spacemacs that looks like it is calling `when-let` for you is actually written as `when-let*`
Mar 02 15:09:38 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> maybe you need to recompile some of the code
Mar 02 16:14:22 <FromGitter>	<BrandonShega> Is there a way to figure out which commit hash my spacemacs is using? If I do `SPC f e v` I just get 0.300.0, but I'd like to know that the emacs that I'm opening is on the latest.  Sometimes I can't tell when using `emacsclient`

Mar 18 14:30:22 <FromGitter>	<nixmaniack> @Cassiel-girl There are ways in which you can get it working but it's the terminal that you'd need to configure. Currently, there's no standard keycode defined for sending `C-<ret>` to app running inside terminal, hence emacs can't do much about that. What you can do is, rebind those functions for something which gets recognized inside terminal emacs.

Mar 19 14:47:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Hi guys! Is it right that from the init-function in the `packages.el` of a layer, I can only run function defined in `funcs.el`?
Mar 19 14:49:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> It seems I can not call (lsp) directly from there, but I can put it in a function in `funcs.el` and then call that funtion from the init-function in `packages.el`

Mar 19 14:51:19 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Here indeed it says funcs.el that all function used by the layer should be declared there... but I do not know what means "all" here... I would expect that I can just call any available function

Mar 19 15:56:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl Does it have something to do with the warning in section 12.11.2 here (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Buffer_002dLocal.html)?
Mar 19 16:02:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook nil t
Mar 19 16:04:17 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Setting-Hooks.html
Mar 19 16:05:45 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @dalanicolai_gitlab - you need to be careful about calling functions from other packages in your layer. i don't know the context, but it could be that `lsp` is not loaded where you're trying to call it?
Mar 19 16:06:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I put it in a   (if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)
Mar 19 16:07:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> And when it tries to run (lsp) but it gives some error message
Mar 19 16:08:59 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> huh... maybe also needs a `with-eval-after-load`?
Mar 19 16:09:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Actually I tried to get the error message now
Mar 19 16:10:00 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I did not use this
Mar 19 16:10:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> And now it works
Mar 19 16:10:25 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> is this after interacting with lsp in your current emacs session?
Mar 19 16:11:09 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> No fresh restart
Mar 19 16:11:26 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :shrug:
Mar 19 16:11:33 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> magic
Mar 19 16:11:35 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :P
Mar 19 16:11:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Now I put in this again and the error is back
Mar 19 16:11:58 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> (if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)
Mar 19 16:12:59 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Took it out again, restarted and again it works
Mar 19 16:16:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Put it in again the error is back
Mar 19 16:16:30 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> ```code paste, see link``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738cd1a2e37e3a0346d143]
Mar 19 16:17:39 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Anyway... this answered my question... so I can call just (lsp) from here
Mar 19 16:17:52 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I prefer to check for the layer of course
Mar 19 16:19:04 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So when I put the  ⏎  ⏎ ```'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp) ⏎                                   (lsp))``` ⏎  ⏎ part in a different function in funcs.el and then call that from the :init here then it works [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738d6b0f0687340b4123f4]
Mar 19 16:21:02 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> must be some arcane load order thing going on
Mar 19 16:21:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So it gives `file mode specification error: (invalid-function (lsp))`
Mar 19 16:21:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I really don't get it
Mar 19 16:21:47 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But anyway... I know how to avoid it
Mar 19 16:21:58 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> so the `if` in the `use-package` does not work, but in the `funcs.el` wrapped in a function it does?
Mar 19 16:22:27 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Yes
Mar 19 16:22:55 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Well in the use-package it also tries to call (lsp)
Mar 19 16:23:01 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> but then it gives an error
Mar 19 16:23:06 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> @dalanicolai_gitlab how do you reffer lsp-mode package?
Mar 19 16:23:17 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> You probably have deleted the autoloads file
Mar 19 16:23:48 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I just updated my spacemacs packages
Mar 19 16:23:57 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Don't think I deleted anything
Mar 19 16:24:22 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> lsp-mode is just installed via the lsp-layer
Mar 19 16:24:23 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> you did PR in lsp-mode package - how do you load it?
Mar 19 16:24:34 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I don't load that one anymore
Mar 19 16:24:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I just updated the packages from melpa
Mar 19 16:24:54 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> just the lsp layer
Mar 19 16:25:11 <FromGitter>	<yyoncho> because `lsp` function is autoloaded -  this means that you should be able to call (lsp) without requiring lsp-mode.el
Mar 19 16:25:41 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I can indeed
Mar 19 16:25:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But not in this way
Mar 19 16:26:18 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But when I create a function with only this in there ⏎  ⏎ ```'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)           (lsp))``` [https://gitter.im/syl20bnr/spacemacs?at=5e738f1d671a621fe09dd128]
Mar 19 16:28:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> I removed everything from my spacemacs file to load the lsp-mode in some other way
Mar 19 16:30:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> So when I remove that `'(if (configuration-layer/layer-used-p 'lsp)` then it just works
Mar 19 16:30:25 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> from the use-package
Mar 19 16:32:57 <FromGitter>	<anddam> while using neotree and projectile is there a way to set a project's root?
Mar 19 16:33:16 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> put a .projectile file in the root folder
Mar 19 16:33:19 <FromGitter>	<anddam> I am manually creating a .projectile file since I could not find a way to tell any of those "this is a project root"
Mar 19 16:33:23 <FromGitter>	<anddam> ok
Mar 19 16:34:03 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Yes fine... or initiate some version control in that directory

Mar 19 16:37:15 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> who can help me?
Mar 19 16:37:43 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Hi I answered you half an hour ago or so
Mar 19 16:37:49 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Just look a little up
Mar 19 16:38:29 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl it is not a straight answer
Mar 19 16:39:05 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl found it?
Mar 19 16:45:42 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> Could you make a detailed explain?
Mar 19 16:45:49 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I can't understand it.
Mar 19 16:45:51 <FromGitter>	<anddam> @dalanicolai_gitlab I have a project root with multiple repos in it
Mar 19 16:46:12 <FromGitter>	<anddam> well I figure I still should put the main repo under revision control…
Mar 19 16:46:13 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl Haha, me neither...
Mar 19 16:46:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But I will try
Mar 19 16:47:50 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @anddam I don't know much about projectile yet
Mar 19 16:48:08 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> But do you want a project for the LSP?
Mar 19 16:50:18 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Hi, I just encountered a strange problem: whenever I type a "^", it does not type the symbol but waits for another input. If I then type a "2", it creates a little "squared" symbol, if I type a space " ", it will create a "^" symbol in the text. I'm using spacemacs, evil mode with auctex. I don't even know how to call this problem to properly search for it :-D
Mar 19 16:51:12 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @anddam You can not find the answer here (https://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/projects/#adding-custom-project-types)?
Mar 19 16:52:04 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> I also don't even know if this is a feature of vim, emacs, spacemacs, auctex....
Mar 19 16:53:20 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi my guess is auxtex
Mar 19 16:54:28 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Ah, interesting, I just tested it in an empty non-tex buffer and the problem is the same.
Mar 19 16:54:44 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl It is not completely clear to me what you want...
Mar 19 16:55:26 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Ah... okay
Mar 19 16:55:28 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> wait
Mar 19 16:56:34 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - oh really... if you `SPC h d m` it will tell you all the modes that are active... it will be a lot but it doesn't happen for me normally

Mar 19 17:01:03 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi you could also try `SPC h d k ^` and see if it tells you what its doing
Mar 19 17:01:15 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - are you trying to define your own layer?
Mar 19 17:01:37 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I want to add a hook to  c++-mode and company mode. The hook changes the company-backends.
Mar 19 17:02:02 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> A.. I see `company-keywords` needs an argument
Mar 19 17:02:40 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Here are minor modes I could imagine cause this by the description: Transient-mark, Auto-Composition, spacemacs-leader-override-mode, eval-sexp-fu-flash
Mar 19 17:02:44 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Do any ring a bell?
Mar 19 17:03:07 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @dalanicolai_gitlab your code not work.
Mar 19 17:03:27 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri I tried this and it again does not register the key. Only once i press "^" and then " " it even displays something

Mar 19 17:04:12 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - could be an Evil thing i guess, I don't use evil so i don't know. does it happen in the `*scratch*` buffer?
Mar 19 17:04:38 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl the recommended way to set your c-c++ backend is with a layer variable.  are you on `master` or `develop` branch?
Mar 19 17:04:43 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri yep, even in the scratch
Mar 19 17:04:48 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> `(c-c++ :variables c-c++-backend 'lsp-clangd)`
Mar 19 17:05:40 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @dalanicolai_gitlab It seems a problem of spacemacs add hook to special mode.
Mar 19 17:06:36 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl I think grant knows more about this then me
Mar 19 17:07:56 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> Haha... I think spacemacs should be able enough for that
Mar 19 17:08:14 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @gcentauri I fixed it. It was a problem with the X server and WSL on windows. Thank you for your help.
Mar 19 17:08:39 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> :P lol
Mar 19 17:09:38 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> Once it was clear to me that no strange editing mode like this exists within spacemacs, the culprit was quickly found!
Mar 19 17:09:56 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - according to the documentation on the `develop` branch, the recommended way to configure C++ is with the LSP backend, which also works for completion (company)
Mar 19 17:10:20 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> it might be that what you're running into is two conflicting pieces of code are setting your company backends
Mar 19 17:10:52 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @rommeswi - you *could* have behavior like that in Emacs, but it should only exist in modes with like... math symbol inputs
Mar 19 17:17:49 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> brrrr, I'm glad I don't have to work in such modes ;-)
Mar 19 17:17:59 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> @rommeswi Yeah, I am on the newest develop branch. And I am configuring my own layer.
Mar 19 17:19:12 <FromGitter>	<Cassiel-girl> I do  not use official c-c++ layer.  And I want to find the problem and make my layer work.
Mar 19 17:22:39 <FromGitter>	<rommeswi> @Cassiel-girl Sorry, I don't think you pinged the right person :-)
Mar 19 17:25:42 <FromGitter>	<dalanicolai_gitlab> @Cassiel-girl  anyway... I think you are at least forgetting to quote the lambda

Mar 19 17:54:44 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @Cassiel-girl - it looks like the `company-backends` variable automatically becomes buffer local when set. the global value of the variable for me is `nil` but depending on what buffer i'm in, it gets set

Mar 19 20:13:24 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> this invokes the Emacs function `describe-function`.  mnemonically it is "help describe function" in Spacemacs

Mar 20 15:18:26 <zakozazz>	thanks gcentauri I will check it!
Mar 20 15:18:36 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> looks like maybe more than one way to do it, but you can switch to different input modes with `C-\` - I'm sure you can find one that works :)
Mar 20 15:23:09 <FromGitter>	<gcentauri> @paxsali - yeah looks like nothing "official" for documentation aside from the directive tags. i haven't seen many examples with additional comments, but i'm sure they're out there
Mar 20 15:30:25 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> How does one tell yasnippet not to create a newline when you're trying to expand something in the middle of the sentence? E.g. you type ```Hello keytrigger World!". Suppose ```keytrigger``` is a key that can be expanded into ```${1:my} ${2:very} ${3:beautiful}```. When you go to the end of ```keytrigger``` and press ```C-p``` for expand, it actually breaks everything into two lines: Lineno 1: ```Hello my very 
Mar 20 15:30:26 <FromGitter>	... beautiful``` and Lineno 2: ```World!```.
Mar 20 15:31:33 <FromGitter>	<paxsali> Obviously my snippet itself doesn't have multiple lines.
