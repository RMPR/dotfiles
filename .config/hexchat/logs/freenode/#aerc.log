Jun 16 20:07:02 <grayhatter>	ddevault: is that the correct subject format?
Jun 16 20:21:26 <ddevault>	grayhatter: yes
Jun 16 20:21:54 <grayhatter>	ddevault: about the worker, is it okay to block the ui thread until the worker responds?
Jun 16 20:21:57 <grayhatter>	> 
Jun 16 20:21:59 <grayhatter>	> obviously not
Jun 16 20:22:17 <grayhatter>	okay then, any suggestions for getting the folder list from aerc?
Jun 16 20:22:50 <ddevault>	callbacks?
Jun 16 20:22:51 <grayhatter>	inside commands/msg/move.go
Jun 16 20:22:54 <ddevault>	we should probably also have an account store
Jun 16 20:23:17 <grayhatter>	I can ask the worker, but then I'd have to block waiting the cb to respond
Jun 16 20:23:33 <grayhatter>	otherwise the first [tab] wouldn't work
Jun 16 20:23:57 <ddevault>	I guess in this case we can block with a timeout
Jun 16 20:24:13 <ddevault>	or don't block, but cancel it if the user starts doing other stuff
Jun 16 20:24:33 <grayhatter>	that's... complicated
Jun 16 20:24:53 <grayhatter>	I wouldn't mind, if it felt right, but it doesn't... It feels more like I'm missing something
Jun 16 20:25:32 <ddevault>	maybe we can show a spinner while we fetch
Jun 16 20:28:29 <grayhatter>	I'd rather cache the directorylist somewhere
Jun 16 20:28:49 <ddevault>	aye
Jun 16 20:39:17 <grayhatter>	okay,
Jun 16 20:39:46 <grayhatter>	time to make a design decision, how do you want to handle multiple matches?
Jun 16 20:40:01 <ddevault>	it's not yet time
Jun 16 20:40:15 <ddevault>	for now it should still only complete when it's unambiguous
Jun 16 20:40:24 <grayhatter>	I can punt for longer on the code, but where []string is converted back to string needs a decison now
Jun 16 20:40:33 <ddevault>	don't complete unless the length is 1
Jun 16 20:40:37 <grayhatter>	it can be changed later obviously, but...
Jun 16 20:41:27 <grayhatter>	:move folder
Jun 16 20:41:44 <grayhatter>	move is unambigious, but folder[1,2,3,4] exist
Jun 16 20:41:51 <ddevault>	then it should fail to complete
Jun 16 20:42:02 <ddevault>	this isn't the permanent design, just the first one
Jun 16 20:42:07 <grayhatter>	obviously, but what should it return
Jun 16 20:42:17 <ddevault>	folder1, folder2, folder3, folder4
Jun 16 20:43:02 <grayhatter>	['move', ['folder1', 'folder2', ...]]
Jun 16 20:43:11 <ddevault>	no
Jun 16 20:43:13 <ddevault>	bah
Jun 16 20:43:17 <grayhatter>	see my problem?
Jun 16 20:43:23 <ddevault>	no, you're just overcomplicating this
Jun 16 20:43:36 <ddevault>	user types "move folder" then presses tab
Jun 16 20:43:43 <ddevault>	the exline gives "move folder" to the completion agent
Jun 16 20:43:53 <ddevault>	the completion agent shell splits it into [move, folder]
Jun 16 20:44:10 <ddevault>	that it's a move command is already apparent, so it sends [move, folder] to the move commands completer
Jun 16 20:44:28 <ddevault>	which knows that it expects a folder in that argument (the cursor is always at the last character its given) and pulls a list of folders
Jun 16 20:44:40 <ddevault>	it then returns a list of possible commands based on folders with that prefix
Jun 16 20:44:51 <ddevault>	["move folder1", "move folder2", "move folder3", "move folder4"]
Jun 16 20:44:58 <ddevault>	the exline at this point gives up because len(results) != 1
Jun 16 20:45:05 <ddevault>	in the future it may do something else
Jun 16 20:45:06 <grayhatter>	that's what I was asking
Jun 16 20:45:33 <grayhatter>	where you want the concationation logic to exist
Jun 16 20:46:03 <grayhatter>	rather; on what level?
Jun 16 20:46:06 <grayhatter>	wilco
Jun 16 20:46:06 <ddevault>	just use your best judgement
Jun 16 20:46:26 <ddevault>	otherwise I'm writing the feature myself, in english, with a faulty emitter, to a faulty parser
Jun 16 20:46:44 <grayhatter>	solid copy

Jun 16 21:23:46 <ddevault>	thanks
Jun 16 21:23:49 <ddevault>	will review tomorrow
Jun 16 21:24:44 <grayhatter>	I couldn't move the inline functions for aerc.go because I don't understand closure in go yet, and didn't want to block on that
Jun 16 21:25:55 <grayhatter>	oh, it works as I want it to... go is really nice!

Jun 17 12:16:42 <heliostatic>	But I'm at a loss
Jun 17 12:37:09 <bookworm>	heliostatic: the date format changed... grab the latest defaults from the example config
Jun 17 12:37:55 <bookworm>	it's not the go time format... meaning Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006 in any order that you want
Jun 17 12:38:00 <bookworm>	now*
Jun 17 12:42:51 <heliostatic>	 Thanks! Trying now.
Jun 17 12:44:12 <heliostatic>	Perfect, worked beautifully. I guess aerc.conf doesn't get overwritten when doing make install because it gets generated at first run. Makes sense, but I didn't realize it.

Jun 22 23:14:47 <secretsnackbar>	I am wondering about installing Aerc
Jun 22 23:15:42 <secretsnackbar>	I guess this isn't really a chat room?
Jun 22 23:22:15 <grayhatter>	no, aerc is an email client...
Jun 22 23:28:19 <secretsnackbar>	yes I understand that, I thought this was a chat room about the aerc email client
Jun 22 23:28:33 <bookworm>	secretsnackbar: IRC is not instant... people have lives you know
Jun 22 23:28:48 <grayhatter>	well... not me
Jun 22 23:29:29 <bookworm>	then go and work on v8 :P
Jun 22 23:29:47 <grayhatter>	lol, writing a blog post currently
Jun 22 23:30:36 <bookworm>	secretsnackbar: as for how to install... there's installation instructions in the readme I guess... if not: make; make install
Jun 22 23:31:05 <secretsnackbar>	yeah, I am fumbling on them
Jun 22 23:31:05 <bookworm>	you need go and some other deps, definitely mentioned in the readme
Jun 22 23:31:28 <secretsnackbar>	because I was trying to follow the instructions and install go
Jun 22 23:31:28 <bookworm>	so then ask a proper question instead of useless "this isn't a chatroom" ramblings
Jun 22 23:31:37 <secretsnackbar>	lol
Jun 22 23:31:45 <bookworm>	that wasn't meant as a joke my dear
Jun 22 23:32:01 <secretsnackbar>	that doesn't mean it's not funny
Jun 22 23:32:38 <bookworm>	so? any real question incoming?
Jun 22 23:32:41 <secretsnackbar>	there was an appropriate response, it was "yes this is a chat room about aerc"
Jun 22 23:32:58 <bookworm>	no the proper response would have been a kick ban
Jun 22 23:33:13 <bookworm>	so can we carry on and solve your issue?
Jun 22 23:35:19 <secretsnackbar>	forgive me, I'm not trying to bother anyone, I just was just trying to follow the instructions at: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc

Jun 24 09:36:31 <grayhatter>	this RFC is bad -_-
Jun 24 09:41:11 <grayhatter>	interestingly enough; I'm glad I read it, the updated RFC5322 says
Jun 24 09:41:28 <grayhatter>	> Comments and folding white spaceSHOULD NOT be used around the "@" in the addr-spec.

Jun 24 09:41:50 <grayhatter>	which was going to be my suggestion...

Jun 27 12:19:20 <quite>	o/
Jun 27 12:37:09 <quite>	it's somewhat confusing how aerc-terminal swallows various ctrl-keys when running the editor, especially when that is emacs...
Jun 27 12:37:17 <quite>	guess i'll write more mails in vim for now :}
Jun 27 12:48:35 *	mg_ is now known as mg
Jun 27 12:49:26 *	mg is now known as mg-
Jun 27 14:30:29 <thurloat_>	jorgicio if you write your emails in vim, you could have a vim snippet for your signature
Jun 27 14:31:52 <ddevault>	you could also rejigger aerc's keybindings to be more emacs-friendly
Jun 27 14:32:05 <ddevault>	I would accept a patch which adds alternative configs to contrib
Jun 27 14:36:59 *	_zachs (4a712f98@74.113.47.152) has joined
Jun 27 14:37:27 <bandali>	it seems that aerc always puts the sender names in double quotes, which in most cases i believe is unnecessary
Jun 27 14:37:31 <bandali>	except when there’s a comma there, of course
Jun 27 14:37:34 <bandali>	any other cases?
Jun 27 14:38:34 <ddevault>	I'm guessing it goes for the simple implementation rather than the most optimal result
Jun 27 14:40:05 <ddevault>	the algorithm is in /usr/lib/go/src/net/mail/message.go:195
Jun 27 14:40:28 <bandali>	ah i see, thanks for the pointer
Jun 27 14:40:44 <ddevault>	looks like at line 233 it always quotes the name without testing if it needs to
Jun 27 14:40:49 <ddevault>	would fix it here and send patch to upstream go
Jun 27 14:41:23 <bandali>	right. do you know if sending a patch to go requires signing a CLA or someshit?
Jun 27 14:41:33 <ddevault>	actually it does, yeah
Jun 27 14:41:35 <ddevault>	gdi
Jun 27 14:41:52 *	bandali sighs
Jun 27 14:42:21 <ddevault>	and their CLA page hangs qutebrowser
Jun 27 14:42:23 <ddevault>	very ncie
Jun 27 14:43:20 <bandali>	that’s awesome
Jun 27 14:43:42 <ddevault>	got enough of it loaded to see that you grant google a do-what-you-want-forever license to your code
Jun 27 14:43:55 <ddevault>	I would accept a patch moving message.go into our source tree
Jun 27 14:45:34 <bandali>	haha yeah fuck that
Jun 27 14:45:36 <bandali>	sounds good
Jun 27 14:45:53 <bandali>	quick q: do you think emersion’s go-message might be a better place for it?
Jun 27 14:45:57 <ddevault>	no
Jun 27 14:46:05 <ddevault>	well, maybe
Jun 27 14:46:11 <ddevault>	but I dunno if he'd accept a similarly principled patch
Jun 27 14:46:52 <bandali>	alrighty. let’s see if he chimes in. if not, let’s put it in aerc i guess
Jun 27 14:49:12 <emersion>	what's this patch about?
Jun 27 14:49:52 <ddevault>	Also, as a political statement, send them the patch but refuse to sign the CLA
Jun 27 14:51:04 <bandali>	great idea :)
Jun 27 14:51:50 <bandali>	emersion, it’s about tweaking double quoting of people’s names in email addresses, but it seems contributing to upstream go requires signing a CLA
Jun 27 14:51:54 <bandali>	and i refuse to do that
Jun 27 14:52:18 <bandali>	so we were wondering if you’d be interested in maintaining a copy of go’s message library in your go-message
Jun 27 14:53:33 <emersion>	ah, yeah, if it's about making the MIME message nicer for humans, i'm not a very big fan of that
Jun 27 14:55:11 <ddevault>	what follows is my three part rebuttal:
Jun 27 14:55:35 <ddevault>	(1) the correct approach results in a smaller message and unlike the last time this came up, doesn't require draining a reader into memory to accomplish
Jun 27 14:55:48 <ddevault>	(2) the code already determines if quoting is necessary for the address part
Jun 27 14:56:04 <ddevault>	(3) humans do read mime messages often enough for it to matter
Jun 27 14:58:17 <bandali>	ha, makes sense to me
Jun 27 15:02:52 <kgz>	mfw I think I've already signed the cla
Jun 27 15:04:26 <bandali>	hm, i think the only cla i ever signed was clojure’s, but that’s before i knew better :p and didn’t actually end up contributing anything to it anyway either
Jun 27 15:06:54 <emersion>	if i had the code copied over already i'd consider
Jun 27 15:07:13 <emersion>	but copying the code just for this is a little bit too much

Jun 27 22:12:26 <quite>	the MessageInfo struct has InternalDate and then a Envelope.Date. msglist uses the first, msgviewer the latter, with various consequences
Jun 27 22:13:01 <quite>	whats up with that? i should continue reading for the source of each i guess... the latter does not grok `Date: Thu, 27 Jun 2019 05:43:54 +0200 (GMT+02:00)`, the former does
Jun 27 22:19:17 <ddevault>	one of them is the date the mail server received the message, the other is the date the message claims to have been written
Jun 27 22:19:20 <ddevault>	don't remember which is which
Jun 27 22:19:51 <quite>	ah, it *should* be Envelope, by the sound of it
Jun 27 22:20:22 <quite>	mail-server-received, that is
Jun 27 22:20:29 <quite>	since that's what that is called in SMTP
Jun 27 22:20:31 <quite>	:)
Jun 27 22:20:34 <quite>	will look into it
Jun 27 22:21:22 <quite>	ah, but it is not!
Jun 27 22:21:36 <quite>	msg.Envelope.Subject e.g.
Jun 27 22:21:55 <quite>	for me that name is confusing, but i've perhaps read too many RFCs
Jun 27 22:22:16 <quite>	to, RFCs too much
Jun 27 22:22:18 <quite>	or
Jun 27 22:35:03 <edwinbalani>	I would have assumed SMTP envelope as well
Jun 27 22:35:46 <edwinbalani>	Although that doesn't carry any date or subject information in itself, literally just sender and recipient
Jun 27 22:38:44 <quite>	indeed
Jun 27 22:39:34 <quite>	i should have destroy^H^H^H^H^H^Htweaked my go-setup in emacs... 
Jun 27 22:39:50 <quite>	shouldn't have :)
Jun 27 22:45:33 <quite>	but i had not read rfc3501
Jun 27 22:46:27 <quite>	where envelope is precisely what they call those headers
Jun 27 22:46:31 <quite>	i had read too few :(
Jun 27 22:47:15 <edwinbalani>	Ah, I'd guessed IMAP terminology is creeping in
Jun 27 22:47:32 <edwinbalani>	This is related to mailstore access after all
Jun 27 22:49:11 <quite>	very much so
Jun 27 22:49:31 <quite>	there is a RFC822Headers as well, reading rfc3501 now

Jul 11 21:10:39 <albertito>	hi! does aerc support tagging, like mutt, where I can tag many messages easily and then apply an action to all of them at once?
Jul 11 21:11:06 <albertito>	(I didn't find it in the docs or bugs but I thought I'd ask just in case :)
Jul 11 21:13:25 <chiefnoah>	pretty sure it doesn't
Jul 11 21:13:30 <chiefnoah>	(yet)
Jul 11 21:55:34 <labib>	Hi aerc community! I'm a first time user on Macos with a small setup issue. When I first went through the new-account form, I used my usual account password but since it has 2FA the password obviously doesn't work. I've since generated a one time password to use with aerc, but now I can't figure out how to delete the account I first setup. The make
Jul 11 21:55:35 <labib>	file suggests that I should be able to fix this in /usr/local/share/aerc/accounts.conf but for me that file is an empty placeholder. Where is aerc storing the account details for the existing account?
Jul 11 21:56:17 <labib>	To be more precise, the file itself isn't empty it just contains the documentation text that it would have prior to account setup
Jul 11 21:57:35 <ddevault>	who is your MTA provider
Jul 11 21:58:45 <labib>	Hi Drew! I'm a Google Apps user (and the admin for the enterprise) and in my first run through the new-account form used my regular Google Apps password. 
Jul 11 21:59:19 <labib>	I have a OTP for the account now, but I can't figure out how to delete the original account in aerc. 
Jul 11 21:59:31 <ddevault>	you have to set up an application password or something
Jul 11 21:59:41 <ddevault>	oh, just remove accounts.conf
Jul 11 21:59:45 <ddevault>	it's in ~/.config/aerc/
Jul 11 21:59:52 <labib>	thank you!
Jul 11 21:59:53 <ddevault>	probably, I dunno what dumb things macOS might do
Jul 11 22:00:27 <labib>	I went digging through /usr/local to find something to edit or delete. Appreciate the help!
Jul 11 22:01:20 <labib>	Removing accounts.conf in ~/.config/aerc worked. Thanks!
Jul 11 22:09:08 <dkess>	are there any current efforts to package aerc for debian? if not i would be willing to look into it
Jul 11 22:09:38 <ddevault>	please do

Jan 02 22:10:16 <gcraggs>	Hi All - Just installed aerc, but when trying to launch it I'm getting "panic: character set not supported". I've tried in both Alacritty and termite. Any suggestions on how to get it working? (aerc -v = 0.3.0)
Jan 02 22:16:43 <bookworm>	what's your TERM/locale?
Jan 02 22:22:16 <gcraggs>	en_GB.UTF_8 - just been digging through the tcell source and tried setting TERM=UTF_8 which solves the issue
Jan 02 22:25:24 <gcraggs>	Not sure if en_GB.UTF_8 is a valid value, or where it's being set though
Jan 02 22:28:32 <bookworm>	not on my system
Jan 02 22:29:05 <bookworm>	what Distro are you on? For me the locale is called en_GB.UTF-8, note the '-' instead of the underscore
Jan 02 22:31:28 <bookworm>	if you have a systemd based distro you can query the locales with `localectl list-locales`
Jan 02 22:36:49 <gcraggs>	I'm using arch. That command lists only the locale you have, so I must have an invalid configuration somewhere. Thanks for helping me! Don't suppose you know where the locale would be set?
Jan 02 22:39:55 <gcraggs>	Nevermind, looks like localectl can set that too. Thanks again for helping!
Jan 02 22:44:30 <bookworm>	that command lists the *available* locales :)

Mar 20 15:42:06 <J[m]>	widgets/pgpinfo.go:29:5: undefined: "errors".Is
Mar 20 15:42:18 <emersion>	you need to upgrade your Go version
Mar 20 15:43:24 <J[m]>	I do not understand what's wrong sadly
Mar 20 15:43:27 <J[m]>	go version go1.12.10 linux/amd64
Mar 20 15:43:34 <J[m]>	That should be the correct version right?
Mar 20 15:44:33 <emersion>	nah, 1.13 is required
Mar 20 15:44:53 <J[m]>	not according to the website? https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc

Apr 10 14:55:51 <noctux>	hmm, I recently installed aerc and it works surprisingly well. However, I cannot seem to find a good multiaccount workflow with it... My mutt setup usually involves having a sidebar across all my accounts, so checking mail is easy. However, with aerc, I always have 3 tabs, and just checking whether anything relevant has happend involves cycling three to four tabs... is there any smarter way? How do
Apr 10 14:55:53 <noctux>	other people deal with it?
Apr 10 15:05:17 <bookworm>	notmuch
Apr 10 15:05:39 <bookworm>	though you'll need to adapt your workflows quite a bit
Apr 10 15:07:54 <noctux>	yeah, I try to get around notmuch, as in my (albeight older) experience, you want to use notmuch on all endpoints, because it did not interact that well with regular imap-muas such as K9 on my phone
Apr 10 15:08:46 <noctux>	but maybe I was just stupid back then :)
Apr 10 15:09:23 <bookworm>	well yes, but you can also just sync back the changes with something like lieer in the case of gmail
Apr 10 15:10:09 <bookworm>	I personally don't care much about the folder a mail is in, I use sieve to keep my main inbox semi clean but that's about it
Apr 10 15:11:00 <bookworm>	and to be honest, who can handle mail on a phone? No threading, garbage editing capabilities... everything longer than 2 sentences gives me the creeps if I need to type it on the phone
Apr 10 15:27:35 <noctux>	part of the pros about controlling the folders: finding a particular message when you are on the phone and searching for it :)
Apr 10 15:28:11 <noctux>	writing on the phone is admittingly quite a pain... and only made worse by the fact that k9 insists on composing html-mails
Apr 10 15:29:22 <bookworm>	you can turn that off
Apr 10 15:29:33 <bookworm>	but k9s editor is still a pain
Apr 10 15:29:44 <bookworm>	but I didn't find a better app than it, so K9 it is

Apr 12 11:37:44 <rakyi>	hey, in README it says "On its first run, aerc will copy the default config files to ~/.config/aerc and show the account configuration wizard." I completed the wizard, but I can't find the config files anywhere. macOS, latest master
Apr 12 11:38:42 <rakyi>	aerc seems to use the config somehow upon restart, I just can't figure out where iit is stored
Apr 12 11:39:15 <rakyi>	any clues, pls?
Apr 12 11:41:07 <rakyi>	~/.config/aerc does not exist
Apr 12 12:59:03 <rakyi>	turns out they are in ~/Library/Preferences/aerc
Apr 12 14:54:16 <bookworm>	added it to the readme

Apr 12 17:26:27 <rakyi>	is it possible to define different key bindings for different accounts?
Apr 12 17:29:32 <bookworm>	no, what's your usecase?
Apr 12 17:31:53 <rakyi>	I'd like to do something like D = :mv Trash<Enter>, but different accounts (gmail, outlook, etc) use different names for trash folder on the server
Apr 12 17:32:57 <bookworm>	should be fairly simple to add a :trash command if you want to fix that
Apr 12 17:33:20 <bookworm>	then we can have a 'trash-folder' option you can can again override with the account
Apr 12 17:33:48 <bookworm>	same as we already have archive
Apr 12 17:38:12 <rakyi>	ddevault said "It doesn't have a trash bin (and it won't)" in https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20091642
Apr 12 17:39:33 <bookworm>	well, we also have :archive 🤷‍♂️ same thing
Apr 12 17:41:28 <bookworm>	I just asked him in #aerc-dev
Apr 12 17:41:56 <bookworm>	and the answer is no
Apr 12 17:42:14 <bookworm>	per account key bindings should be implemented
Apr 12 17:43:57 <rakyi>	cool, thanks

Apr 17 19:59:52 <Xogium>	hi guys… I just had this while replying to some email I received
Apr 17 19:59:55 <Xogium>	> Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Apr 17 19:59:56 <Xogium>	> Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Apr 17 20:00:05 <Xogium>	that's… Actually, a thing ?
Apr 17 20:00:34 <Xogium>	why would I… Quote their message in base64 ?
Apr 17 20:04:14 <emersion>	sounds like a bug
Apr 17 20:06:01 <Xogium>	ugh, probably
Apr 17 20:06:14 <Xogium>	I'll try to see if I can reproduce
Apr 17 20:07:11 <pepper_chico>	it happened for me as well, but I simply forgot about it cuz I'm not replying emails lately
Apr 17 20:07:21 <Xogium>	nop, I got only one email that does this
Apr 17 20:07:51 <Xogium>	this is crazy weird
Apr 17 20:10:44 <Xogium>	how do I save an email to disk to examine it ? I keep forgetting
Apr 17 20:17:02 <Xogium>	what I'm a bit surprised about is why would it feel the need to actually quote the content encoding and etc in the reply ?
Apr 17 20:25:26 <bookworm>	broken mail?
Apr 17 20:25:54 <Xogium>	no idea
Apr 17 20:26:06 <Xogium>	I want to save it to disk to examine it but I forget how lol
Apr 17 20:26:36 <bookworm>	you can pipe it with `:pipe -m sh -c "cat >somefile"` or something like it
Apr 17 20:26:47 <bookworm>	tee works as well (the command)
Apr 17 20:27:11 <Xogium>	neat
Apr 17 20:29:47 <Xogium>	ah, yeah… Ms exchange. Go figure
Apr 17 20:29:55 <bookworm>	-.-
Apr 17 20:30:19 *	bookworm pushes the responsibility of fixing it to the reporter
Apr 17 20:31:06 <Xogium>	it is really encoded in base64 WTF
Apr 17 20:31:27 <Xogium>	I have no bloody idea how less even displays it fine
Apr 17 20:31:29 <bookworm>	ah yeah that's valid
Apr 17 20:31:37 <bookworm>	aerc decodes it
Apr 17 20:31:44 <Xogium>	lovely
Apr 17 20:31:57 <Xogium>	so huh… How the hell do I quote such a message ?
Apr 17 20:32:00 <bookworm>	but it should fo that during quoting as well
Apr 17 20:32:04 <Xogium>	oh
Apr 17 20:32:05 <bookworm>	do*
Apr 17 20:32:15 <bookworm>	is the mail private?
Apr 17 20:32:36 <Xogium>	yeah, unfortunately :/
Apr 17 20:32:52 <bookworm>	mhm, then fix it and send a patch please ;P
Apr 17 20:32:56 <Xogium>	but huh, what's the point of encoding mails in base64 anyway, if everyone can decode it ?
Apr 17 20:33:08 <Xogium>	I can't code in go :/
Apr 17 20:33:39 <bookworm>	same point as quoted-printable... servers in-between can only handle ascii because English is the only language on Earth
Apr 17 20:34:08 <bookworm>	historical baggage as always
Apr 17 20:34:14 <bookworm>	welcome to email
Apr 17 20:35:05 <Xogium>	charming
Apr 17 20:36:33 <pepper_chico>	well, I lived fine on mutt by setting everything to utf-8
Apr 17 20:36:34 <Xogium>	so er, I'd fix it, but I have no idea of what aerc's code is doing because I can't even read it clearly :S
Apr 17 20:36:45 <bookworm>	how private is private? As in no one or as in not the whole internet?
Apr 17 20:37:08 <Xogium>	rather the later

Apr 20 08:43:12 <Mattemagikern>	Will do! :) 
Apr 20 09:06:25 <icyphox>	bookworm: Recall the OpenBSD build issues I was having? I managed to get a fix in upstream. 
Apr 20 09:07:50 <bookworm>	oh really?
Apr 20 09:07:59 <bookworm>	nice!
Apr 20 09:08:00 <icyphox>	https://github.com/ProtonMail/crypto/commit/71bec3603bf3a9bb42e31198bc4ab49985570971
Apr 20 09:08:19 <icyphox>	Yes. What's left to be done is upgrading to this newer commit, I guess.
Apr 20 09:09:10 <icyphox>	I'm not too familiar with go, but I believe you'll have to update the 'replace' in the go.mod, right?
Apr 20 09:10:35 <icyphox>	Also, I must mention: I'm not sure if this is even /the/ fix. The ProtonMail/crypto maintainer claims so.
Apr 20 09:12:20 <bookworm>	well, using internal is... not clean in the first place
Apr 20 09:23:33 <bookworm>	icyphox: re updating... we didn't exactly keep the fork up to date and the diffstat to your fix is rather large
Apr 20 09:24:16 <bookworm>	can you send the update to the ML? But in this case I'll let Drew approve it, security stuff is a tad too hot for me ;)
Apr 20 09:25:09 <bookworm>	theoretically you can just run go update $package; go mod tidy and that should do the trick (do build with the notmuch flag on though when you do that)
Apr 20 09:26:51 <bookworm>	ehm, go get $pkg
Apr 20 09:32:10 <kskarthik>	Aerc has email thread support ?

Apr 20 21:49:27 <heywoodlh>	Is it normal for a lot of HTML emails to not render in aerc, even when piping to `w3m`? My default MIME type order is `alternatives=text/plain,text/html` 
Apr 20 21:50:27 <heywoodlh>	For those emails that offer a plaintext version this works great for me. But for the ones that don't, I have had to open a web client to look at those emails to decipher them.
Apr 20 22:05:58 <pepper_chico>	you should check whether you're actually changing to the html part for the w3m view, otherwise you may be simply viewed the default text part of a multipart message, which often gets to be completely gibberish sent as text version of the html part by the sender.
Apr 20 22:07:08 <pepper_chico>	if you're doing that, then there isn't much to do beyond that than simply open it with browser
Apr 20 22:20:41 <heywoodlh>	pepper_chico if I understand right, I should switch to the HTML MIME type before piping to w3m?
Apr 20 22:20:54 <heywoodlh>	If so, I just tried that and I have the same result.

Apr 21 10:29:07 <bookworm>	well, you can do what outlook etc do... add a "Fwd: " or whatever prefix, then write whatever is in the body of the forwarded email to the body of the current email, after some indicator
Apr 21 10:29:25 <bookworm>	option 2: attach it as a file to the message (what your client did)
Apr 21 10:30:25 <bookworm>	option 3: bounce the message, meaning don't change any header and simply redirect, setting a different envelope-from / envelop-to. This will break spf and probably put you in spam, depending on where the mail was originally sent from
Apr 21 10:30:52 <bookworm>	but that all depends on the domain that send the original mail, plus the configuration of the receiving system
Apr 21 10:31:14 <twohot>	wow
Apr 21 10:34:53 <twohot>	I guess I's just have to figure out a scripted way to get a readable fowarding

Apr 22 19:59:50 <heywoodlh>	Is there a way to use HTML in your signature file?
Apr 22 20:07:39 *	bookworm pulls out the pitchfork and gathers the others
Apr 22 20:11:22 <heywoodlh>	Hahaha it's not that important I was just curious 
Apr 22 20:11:26 <heywoodlh>	Mainly for links 
Apr 22 20:11:36 <heywoodlh>	Long links look terrible in email signature
Apr 22 20:12:56 <bookworm>	email signatures look terrible in mails you mean
Apr 22 20:13:17 <bookworm>	but no, aerc only does plain text (by design), minus attachments that is
Apr 22 20:14:01 <bookworm>	Drew has rather strict opinions regarding plain text mails
Apr 22 20:15:08 <bookworm>	you could try and set the content type header manually, if you are lucky the current implementation will update it in place, but I didn't test that
Apr 22 21:12:23 <pepper_chico>	heywoodlh: you may write text email and pass it to a filter to attach an html part automatically, which can have this signature embedded. I actually write my emails as markdown and have a sendmail script that first adds an html part (by calling pandoc over the text) before sending.

Apr 22 22:03:36 <heywoodlh>	pepper_chico, being able to use Markdown in a message sounds amazing.
Apr 22 22:10:48 <pepper_chico>	heywoodlh: I have reapplied an old recipe (https://nosubstance.me/post/mutt-secret-sauce/) for aerc. Needs this updated script: https://gist.github.com/oblitum/6eeffaebd9a4744e762e49e6eb19d189#file-mimembellish-fixed-for-aerc. The post explains its use.
Apr 22 22:11:09 <heywoodlh>	Thank you for the resources. That's super helpful.
Apr 22 22:12:49 <pepper_chico>	today there's some stuff there I don't use anymore, for example, I don't run a preview daemon anymore because iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim is enough and much better for [neo]vim previewing
Apr 22 22:13:53 <pepper_chico>	but multipart transformation is still based on MIMEmbellish script
Apr 22 22:14:56 <heywoodlh>	Yeah, that makes sense. I'm kind of just getting started with Aerc, configuring it, etc. so ironing out all these workflows for me now is super helpful.
Apr 22 22:15:16 <heywoodlh>	Again, I really appreciate the resources
Apr 22 22:16:29 <pepper_chico>	np, moving to aerc also removed the need for multiple instances per account for me, I had to do that with mutt cuz their multiple account support was really bad
Apr 22 22:17:11 <heywoodlh>	Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Aerc seems to strike a really good usable balance for me.

Apr 24 14:40:28 <bfiedler>	Has anyone else noticed that large Exchange servers respond significantly slower than other mail servers or even close the connection after accessing a few folders? I'm trying to find out if the problem is with that specific Exchange server of if others have noticed it as well.

Oct 16 13:39:25 <pixy>	hey! i've set up an account with maildir connected to a server of mine, i would like to be able to manually synchronize the maildir from the interface, but putting `s = :term mbsync ~/.config/mbsync/mbsyncrc -a<Enter>" doesn't seem to cut it for some reason
Oct 16 13:39:39 <pixy>	do any of you have an idea of how i could bind 's' to synchronizing the maildir?
Oct 16 13:40:22 <pixy>	(i missed the words 'in binds.conf' there but i'm betting the idea is still clear :P)
Oct 16 13:43:13 <bookworm>	pixy: what's the error you observe?
Oct 16 13:43:52 <pixy>	no obvious error - when i depress 's' the interface flickers for a frame or two and then nothing
Oct 16 13:43:57 <pixy>	the mailbox isn't synchronized
Oct 16 13:44:05 <bookworm>	pretty sure you are calling it wrong
Oct 16 13:44:14 <bookworm>	you need to add -c for starters
Oct 16 13:44:27 <pixy>	to `:term"?
Oct 16 13:44:30 <pixy>	i'll give that a shot
Oct 16 13:44:32 <bookworm>	to mbsync
Oct 16 13:44:38 <bookworm>	term doesn't have a -c flag
Oct 16 13:44:54 <pixy>	ah
Oct 16 13:45:10 <bookworm>	mbsync -c ~/.config/mbsync/mbsyncrc -a
Oct 16 13:45:19 <pixy>	ah yes that was just at typo
Oct 16 13:45:24 <pixy>	that's in there of course
Oct 16 13:45:50 <bookworm>	what happens if you run the command manually in the term?
Oct 16 13:45:52 <pixy>	i was, in fact, about to say that running the command in another terminal while aerc is running causes the desired effect, namely both the maildir and interface updating
Oct 16 13:46:02 <bookworm>	meaning, do :term<Enter> then add the mbsync command

Oct 20 14:58:25 <bookworm>	hiya: if the instructions given weren't enough for you, no
Oct 20 14:59:29 <greenfoo>	Oh, sorry... I had no idea how the IRC bridge worked.
Oct 20 15:00:14 <hiya>	bookworm: Which instructions? Sorry I missed it. 
Oct 20 15:00:16 <greenfoo>	Related to this, if my message didn't make it to IRC (the one explaining how to apply the patch), maybe hiya did not see it
Oct 20 15:03:29 <bookworm>	it did... if in an annoying fashion
Oct 20 15:04:03 <hiya>	Ok so matrix.org link has info on it
Oct 20 15:04:05 <hiya>	Thanks
Oct 20 15:13:30 <greenfoo>	bookworm: do you know what is it exactly that I need to avoid to prevent spamming the IRC channel? Is it just multiline messages? Or something else?
Oct 20 15:14:51 <bookworm>	don't do newlines, keep the msg within the irc max length
Oct 20 15:15:21 <gjabell>	also don't use matrix's completion if replying to someone, will muck up the formatting
Oct 20 15:15:22 <bookworm>	pictures are fine... no difference between matrix spamming the link or some other paste site
Oct 20 15:15:27 <bookworm>	that too
Oct 20 15:15:48 <greenfoo>	understood, thanks.
Oct 20 15:16:15 <Xogium>	greenfoo: you're not spamming, the matrix irc bridge is posting all your messages that have line breaks like this: greenfoo sent a long message, followed by an url to a txt file
Oct 20 15:16:56 <Xogium>	instead of doing proper splitting of any messages for irc
Oct 20 15:17:01 <bookworm>	...which is spam on the IRC side
Oct 20 15:17:09 <greenfoo>	Oh, ok.... I guess the bridge could be a little more "intelligent" and post each individual line as a single message
Oct 20 15:17:11 <greenfoo>	ok, ok
Oct 20 15:17:18 <bookworm>	it could
Oct 20 15:17:25 <bookworm>	alas the matrix folks are "special"
Oct 20 15:17:56 <Xogium>	well, for me spam is more like a a gitan flood of lines
Oct 20 15:18:00 <Xogium>	err, a giant
Oct 20 15:18:19 <bookworm>	it's almost impossible to follow chans with lots of matrix users... go to neovim if you don't believe me
Oct 20 15:18:29 <bookworm>	every second message is that "long message" stuff
Oct 20 15:18:46 <bookworm>	prior to that happening I'll enforce IRC use here
Oct 20 15:18:52 <Xogium>	I don't like it, the link and stuff either, but… At least it is better than having people posting logs or stuff like it directly in the irc channel, instead of on a pastebin
Oct 20 15:19:19 <Xogium>	but yes I agree it is very annoying, outside of that particular… Use
Oct 20 15:19:49 <bookworm>	sadly it's swallowing most IRC traffic
Oct 20 15:19:58 <Xogium>	yep, very annoying

Nov 07 22:14:23 <ols>	where does aerc-config take SHAREDIR from? can't find anything in man pages to suggest and when i launch aerc itcan't find the templates (they are where they "should" be and readbable by the user)
Nov 07 22:16:42 <ols>	ah, i think this might be an issue with the Makefile on openbsd, looks like it should replace @SHAREDIR@ with the actual sharedir as defined by PREFIX, etc. in the Makefile :)
Nov 07 22:20:15 <ols>	hm, removing the file and rerunning make install sorts it, user error ignore me!

Feb 01 09:56:18 <erikh>	slapped together a Q&D offlineimap replacement tonight that is pretty fast
Feb 01 11:07:04 <tzlil>	can i make aerc use GNUPG's keyring? i thought it would by default but im getting `failed to read PGP message: opengpg: incorrect key`
Feb 01 12:15:49 <bookworm>	no
Feb 01 12:16:22 <bookworm>	aerc will use its own, separate keyring tzlil as Drew doesn't like gnupg and doesn't want to rely on it
Feb 01 12:17:04 <tzlil>	kk, how can i add my key then?
Feb 01 12:17:11 <bookworm>	the implementation we have currently is also pretty bare bones and definitely not up to speed or ready for general use

Feb 01 22:02:57 <metalune>	Hi, I am having problems with aerc
Feb 01 22:03:12 <metalune>	I want to connect it to my account, and I made sure that I had everything set up correctly, but it just fails
Feb 01 22:03:24 <metalune>	err, it doesn't fail, it just keeps trying to connect, at least that's what I think
Feb 01 22:03:30 <metalune>	it shows these "[...]" dancing around
Feb 02 00:03:23 <erikh>	not sure if it works in aerc, but the next time that happens, hold control and press \
Feb 02 00:03:50 <erikh>	this should dump a golang stack trace, which the aerc devs can probably use
Feb 02 00:04:12 <erikh>	if ^\ doesn't work, try sending SIGQUIT: kill -QUIT `pidof aerc`
Feb 02 00:05:28 <erikh>	ok the kill -QUIT works but ^\ is trapped, likely by vterm or some other ui toolkit

Feb 02 20:37:31 <bookworm>	doesn't work yet
Feb 02 20:37:37 <bookworm>	least not in a nice way
Feb 02 21:13:00 <tzlil>	bookworm: i see, thats a shame
Feb 02 21:13:30 <tzlil>	is there any way around this? aka. encrypting it with gpg or w/e beforehand and making aerc send the file?
Feb 02 21:14:39 <bookworm>	you can inline encrypt yes..."traditional" gpg encryption
Feb 02 21:14:49 <tzlil>	inline encrypt?
Feb 02 21:15:07 <tzlil>	also, would i send it armored? i dont really know rules of email
Feb 02 21:17:03 <bookworm>	you would yes... although it doesn't matter much as we encode it anyhow
Feb 02 21:17:13 <bookworm>	so what you see in the editor isn't what gets sent
Feb 02 21:18:06 <bookworm>	"the rules of email" tell you to use a multipart message with a gpg mimetype instead but this ain't supported yet
Feb 02 21:18:06 <tzlil>	how would you suggest i go about doing this then
Feb 02 21:18:12 <tzlil>	i see..
Feb 02 21:18:29 <bookworm>	filter it through gpg, then hope for the best
Feb 02 21:18:43 <bookworm>	or use neomutt for the rare case where you need gpg
Feb 02 21:18:49 <tzlil>	"filter it through gpg" ?
Feb 02 21:18:53 <bookworm>	yes
Feb 02 21:18:59 <tzlil>	im not sure what that means
Feb 02 21:19:03 <bookworm>	which editor do you use?
Feb 02 21:19:31 <tzlil>	inside aerc? vim
Feb 02 21:19:42 <bookworm>	then literally filter
Feb 02 21:20:22 <bookworm>	https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Use_filter_commands_to_process_text
Feb 02 21:20:47 <tzlil>	oh i see
Feb 02 21:21:44 <tzlil>	ill try, thank you
Feb 02 21:49:11 <erikh>	neophrema: yeah, that's basically how I addressed it too.
Feb 02 21:50:09 <erikh>	in a world of dreppers, it's best if you just patch where you're welcome

Feb 07 15:20:50 <hoistbypetard>	good morning all... i'm frequently seeing segfaults that look like this:
Feb 07 15:20:53 <hoistbypetard>	https://paste.sr.ht/~tuxpup/1f144fd6a8d24efdcc11bd95c4a7bcd223aa2dff
Feb 07 15:21:28 <bookworm>	hoistbypetard: version?
Feb 07 15:21:30 <hoistbypetard>	the general pattern is that it happens if I let things sit while viewing or composing a message, when I try to return to the message view
Feb 07 15:21:57 <hoistbypetard>	it's the arch-packaged 0.5.2
Feb 07 15:22:15 <bookworm>	thanks
