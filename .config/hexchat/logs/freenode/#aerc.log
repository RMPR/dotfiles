Jun 16 20:07:02 <grayhatter>	ddevault: is that the correct subject format?
Jun 16 20:21:26 <ddevault>	grayhatter: yes
Jun 16 20:21:54 <grayhatter>	ddevault: about the worker, is it okay to block the ui thread until the worker responds?
Jun 16 20:21:57 <grayhatter>	> 
Jun 16 20:21:59 <grayhatter>	> obviously not
Jun 16 20:22:17 <grayhatter>	okay then, any suggestions for getting the folder list from aerc?
Jun 16 20:22:50 <ddevault>	callbacks?
Jun 16 20:22:51 <grayhatter>	inside commands/msg/move.go
Jun 16 20:22:54 <ddevault>	we should probably also have an account store
Jun 16 20:23:17 <grayhatter>	I can ask the worker, but then I'd have to block waiting the cb to respond
Jun 16 20:23:33 <grayhatter>	otherwise the first [tab] wouldn't work
Jun 16 20:23:57 <ddevault>	I guess in this case we can block with a timeout
Jun 16 20:24:13 <ddevault>	or don't block, but cancel it if the user starts doing other stuff
Jun 16 20:24:33 <grayhatter>	that's... complicated
Jun 16 20:24:53 <grayhatter>	I wouldn't mind, if it felt right, but it doesn't... It feels more like I'm missing something
Jun 16 20:25:32 <ddevault>	maybe we can show a spinner while we fetch
Jun 16 20:28:29 <grayhatter>	I'd rather cache the directorylist somewhere
Jun 16 20:28:49 <ddevault>	aye
Jun 16 20:39:17 <grayhatter>	okay,
Jun 16 20:39:46 <grayhatter>	time to make a design decision, how do you want to handle multiple matches?
Jun 16 20:40:01 <ddevault>	it's not yet time
Jun 16 20:40:15 <ddevault>	for now it should still only complete when it's unambiguous
Jun 16 20:40:24 <grayhatter>	I can punt for longer on the code, but where []string is converted back to string needs a decison now
Jun 16 20:40:33 <ddevault>	don't complete unless the length is 1
Jun 16 20:40:37 <grayhatter>	it can be changed later obviously, but...
Jun 16 20:41:27 <grayhatter>	:move folder
Jun 16 20:41:44 <grayhatter>	move is unambigious, but folder[1,2,3,4] exist
Jun 16 20:41:51 <ddevault>	then it should fail to complete
Jun 16 20:42:02 <ddevault>	this isn't the permanent design, just the first one
Jun 16 20:42:07 <grayhatter>	obviously, but what should it return
Jun 16 20:42:17 <ddevault>	folder1, folder2, folder3, folder4
Jun 16 20:43:02 <grayhatter>	['move', ['folder1', 'folder2', ...]]
Jun 16 20:43:11 <ddevault>	no
Jun 16 20:43:13 <ddevault>	bah
Jun 16 20:43:17 <grayhatter>	see my problem?
Jun 16 20:43:23 <ddevault>	no, you're just overcomplicating this
Jun 16 20:43:36 <ddevault>	user types "move folder" then presses tab
Jun 16 20:43:43 <ddevault>	the exline gives "move folder" to the completion agent
Jun 16 20:43:53 <ddevault>	the completion agent shell splits it into [move, folder]
Jun 16 20:44:10 <ddevault>	that it's a move command is already apparent, so it sends [move, folder] to the move commands completer
Jun 16 20:44:28 <ddevault>	which knows that it expects a folder in that argument (the cursor is always at the last character its given) and pulls a list of folders
Jun 16 20:44:40 <ddevault>	it then returns a list of possible commands based on folders with that prefix
Jun 16 20:44:51 <ddevault>	["move folder1", "move folder2", "move folder3", "move folder4"]
Jun 16 20:44:58 <ddevault>	the exline at this point gives up because len(results) != 1
Jun 16 20:45:05 <ddevault>	in the future it may do something else
Jun 16 20:45:06 <grayhatter>	that's what I was asking
Jun 16 20:45:33 <grayhatter>	where you want the concationation logic to exist
Jun 16 20:46:03 <grayhatter>	rather; on what level?
Jun 16 20:46:06 <grayhatter>	wilco
Jun 16 20:46:06 <ddevault>	just use your best judgement
Jun 16 20:46:26 <ddevault>	otherwise I'm writing the feature myself, in english, with a faulty emitter, to a faulty parser
Jun 16 20:46:44 <grayhatter>	solid copy

Jun 16 21:23:46 <ddevault>	thanks
Jun 16 21:23:49 <ddevault>	will review tomorrow
Jun 16 21:24:44 <grayhatter>	I couldn't move the inline functions for aerc.go because I don't understand closure in go yet, and didn't want to block on that
Jun 16 21:25:55 <grayhatter>	oh, it works as I want it to... go is really nice!

Jun 17 12:16:42 <heliostatic>	But I'm at a loss
Jun 17 12:37:09 <bookworm>	heliostatic: the date format changed... grab the latest defaults from the example config
Jun 17 12:37:55 <bookworm>	it's not the go time format... meaning Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006 in any order that you want
Jun 17 12:38:00 <bookworm>	now*
Jun 17 12:42:51 <heliostatic>	 Thanks! Trying now.
Jun 17 12:44:12 <heliostatic>	Perfect, worked beautifully. I guess aerc.conf doesn't get overwritten when doing make install because it gets generated at first run. Makes sense, but I didn't realize it.

Jun 22 23:14:47 <secretsnackbar>	I am wondering about installing Aerc
Jun 22 23:15:42 <secretsnackbar>	I guess this isn't really a chat room?
Jun 22 23:22:15 <grayhatter>	no, aerc is an email client...
Jun 22 23:28:19 <secretsnackbar>	yes I understand that, I thought this was a chat room about the aerc email client
Jun 22 23:28:33 <bookworm>	secretsnackbar: IRC is not instant... people have lives you know
Jun 22 23:28:48 <grayhatter>	well... not me
Jun 22 23:29:29 <bookworm>	then go and work on v8 :P
Jun 22 23:29:47 <grayhatter>	lol, writing a blog post currently
Jun 22 23:30:36 <bookworm>	secretsnackbar: as for how to install... there's installation instructions in the readme I guess... if not: make; make install
Jun 22 23:31:05 <secretsnackbar>	yeah, I am fumbling on them
Jun 22 23:31:05 <bookworm>	you need go and some other deps, definitely mentioned in the readme
Jun 22 23:31:28 <secretsnackbar>	because I was trying to follow the instructions and install go
Jun 22 23:31:28 <bookworm>	so then ask a proper question instead of useless "this isn't a chatroom" ramblings
Jun 22 23:31:37 <secretsnackbar>	lol
Jun 22 23:31:45 <bookworm>	that wasn't meant as a joke my dear
Jun 22 23:32:01 <secretsnackbar>	that doesn't mean it's not funny
Jun 22 23:32:38 <bookworm>	so? any real question incoming?
Jun 22 23:32:41 <secretsnackbar>	there was an appropriate response, it was "yes this is a chat room about aerc"
Jun 22 23:32:58 <bookworm>	no the proper response would have been a kick ban
Jun 22 23:33:13 <bookworm>	so can we carry on and solve your issue?
Jun 22 23:35:19 <secretsnackbar>	forgive me, I'm not trying to bother anyone, I just was just trying to follow the instructions at: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/aerc

Jun 24 09:36:31 <grayhatter>	this RFC is bad -_-
Jun 24 09:41:11 <grayhatter>	interestingly enough; I'm glad I read it, the updated RFC5322 says
Jun 24 09:41:28 <grayhatter>	> Comments and folding white spaceSHOULD NOT be used around the "@" in the addr-spec.

Jun 24 09:41:50 <grayhatter>	which was going to be my suggestion...

Jun 27 12:19:20 <quite>	o/
Jun 27 12:37:09 <quite>	it's somewhat confusing how aerc-terminal swallows various ctrl-keys when running the editor, especially when that is emacs...
Jun 27 12:37:17 <quite>	guess i'll write more mails in vim for now :}
Jun 27 12:48:35 *	mg_ is now known as mg
Jun 27 12:49:26 *	mg is now known as mg-
Jun 27 14:30:29 <thurloat_>	jorgicio if you write your emails in vim, you could have a vim snippet for your signature
Jun 27 14:31:52 <ddevault>	you could also rejigger aerc's keybindings to be more emacs-friendly
Jun 27 14:32:05 <ddevault>	I would accept a patch which adds alternative configs to contrib
Jun 27 14:36:59 *	_zachs (4a712f98@74.113.47.152) has joined
Jun 27 14:37:27 <bandali>	it seems that aerc always puts the sender names in double quotes, which in most cases i believe is unnecessary
Jun 27 14:37:31 <bandali>	except when there’s a comma there, of course
Jun 27 14:37:34 <bandali>	any other cases?
Jun 27 14:38:34 <ddevault>	I'm guessing it goes for the simple implementation rather than the most optimal result
Jun 27 14:40:05 <ddevault>	the algorithm is in /usr/lib/go/src/net/mail/message.go:195
Jun 27 14:40:28 <bandali>	ah i see, thanks for the pointer
Jun 27 14:40:44 <ddevault>	looks like at line 233 it always quotes the name without testing if it needs to
Jun 27 14:40:49 <ddevault>	would fix it here and send patch to upstream go
Jun 27 14:41:23 <bandali>	right. do you know if sending a patch to go requires signing a CLA or someshit?
Jun 27 14:41:33 <ddevault>	actually it does, yeah
Jun 27 14:41:35 <ddevault>	gdi
Jun 27 14:41:52 *	bandali sighs
Jun 27 14:42:21 <ddevault>	and their CLA page hangs qutebrowser
Jun 27 14:42:23 <ddevault>	very ncie
Jun 27 14:43:20 <bandali>	that’s awesome
Jun 27 14:43:42 <ddevault>	got enough of it loaded to see that you grant google a do-what-you-want-forever license to your code
Jun 27 14:43:55 <ddevault>	I would accept a patch moving message.go into our source tree
Jun 27 14:45:34 <bandali>	haha yeah fuck that
Jun 27 14:45:36 <bandali>	sounds good
Jun 27 14:45:53 <bandali>	quick q: do you think emersion’s go-message might be a better place for it?
Jun 27 14:45:57 <ddevault>	no
Jun 27 14:46:05 <ddevault>	well, maybe
Jun 27 14:46:11 <ddevault>	but I dunno if he'd accept a similarly principled patch
Jun 27 14:46:52 <bandali>	alrighty. let’s see if he chimes in. if not, let’s put it in aerc i guess
Jun 27 14:49:12 <emersion>	what's this patch about?
Jun 27 14:49:52 <ddevault>	Also, as a political statement, send them the patch but refuse to sign the CLA
Jun 27 14:51:04 <bandali>	great idea :)
Jun 27 14:51:50 <bandali>	emersion, it’s about tweaking double quoting of people’s names in email addresses, but it seems contributing to upstream go requires signing a CLA
Jun 27 14:51:54 <bandali>	and i refuse to do that
Jun 27 14:52:18 <bandali>	so we were wondering if you’d be interested in maintaining a copy of go’s message library in your go-message
Jun 27 14:53:33 <emersion>	ah, yeah, if it's about making the MIME message nicer for humans, i'm not a very big fan of that
Jun 27 14:55:11 <ddevault>	what follows is my three part rebuttal:
Jun 27 14:55:35 <ddevault>	(1) the correct approach results in a smaller message and unlike the last time this came up, doesn't require draining a reader into memory to accomplish
Jun 27 14:55:48 <ddevault>	(2) the code already determines if quoting is necessary for the address part
Jun 27 14:56:04 <ddevault>	(3) humans do read mime messages often enough for it to matter
Jun 27 14:58:17 <bandali>	ha, makes sense to me
Jun 27 15:02:52 <kgz>	mfw I think I've already signed the cla
Jun 27 15:04:26 <bandali>	hm, i think the only cla i ever signed was clojure’s, but that’s before i knew better :p and didn’t actually end up contributing anything to it anyway either
Jun 27 15:06:54 <emersion>	if i had the code copied over already i'd consider
Jun 27 15:07:13 <emersion>	but copying the code just for this is a little bit too much

Jun 27 22:12:26 <quite>	the MessageInfo struct has InternalDate and then a Envelope.Date. msglist uses the first, msgviewer the latter, with various consequences
Jun 27 22:13:01 <quite>	whats up with that? i should continue reading for the source of each i guess... the latter does not grok `Date: Thu, 27 Jun 2019 05:43:54 +0200 (GMT+02:00)`, the former does
Jun 27 22:19:17 <ddevault>	one of them is the date the mail server received the message, the other is the date the message claims to have been written
Jun 27 22:19:20 <ddevault>	don't remember which is which
Jun 27 22:19:51 <quite>	ah, it *should* be Envelope, by the sound of it
Jun 27 22:20:22 <quite>	mail-server-received, that is
Jun 27 22:20:29 <quite>	since that's what that is called in SMTP
Jun 27 22:20:31 <quite>	:)
Jun 27 22:20:34 <quite>	will look into it
Jun 27 22:21:22 <quite>	ah, but it is not!
Jun 27 22:21:36 <quite>	msg.Envelope.Subject e.g.
Jun 27 22:21:55 <quite>	for me that name is confusing, but i've perhaps read too many RFCs
Jun 27 22:22:16 <quite>	to, RFCs too much
Jun 27 22:22:18 <quite>	or
Jun 27 22:35:03 <edwinbalani>	I would have assumed SMTP envelope as well
Jun 27 22:35:46 <edwinbalani>	Although that doesn't carry any date or subject information in itself, literally just sender and recipient
Jun 27 22:38:44 <quite>	indeed
Jun 27 22:39:34 <quite>	i should have destroy^H^H^H^H^H^Htweaked my go-setup in emacs... 
Jun 27 22:39:50 <quite>	shouldn't have :)
Jun 27 22:45:33 <quite>	but i had not read rfc3501
Jun 27 22:46:27 <quite>	where envelope is precisely what they call those headers
Jun 27 22:46:31 <quite>	i had read too few :(
Jun 27 22:47:15 <edwinbalani>	Ah, I'd guessed IMAP terminology is creeping in
Jun 27 22:47:32 <edwinbalani>	This is related to mailstore access after all
Jun 27 22:49:11 <quite>	very much so
Jun 27 22:49:31 <quite>	there is a RFC822Headers as well, reading rfc3501 now

Jul 11 21:10:39 <albertito>	hi! does aerc support tagging, like mutt, where I can tag many messages easily and then apply an action to all of them at once?
Jul 11 21:11:06 <albertito>	(I didn't find it in the docs or bugs but I thought I'd ask just in case :)
Jul 11 21:13:25 <chiefnoah>	pretty sure it doesn't
Jul 11 21:13:30 <chiefnoah>	(yet)
Jul 11 21:55:34 <labib>	Hi aerc community! I'm a first time user on Macos with a small setup issue. When I first went through the new-account form, I used my usual account password but since it has 2FA the password obviously doesn't work. I've since generated a one time password to use with aerc, but now I can't figure out how to delete the account I first setup. The make
Jul 11 21:55:35 <labib>	file suggests that I should be able to fix this in /usr/local/share/aerc/accounts.conf but for me that file is an empty placeholder. Where is aerc storing the account details for the existing account?
Jul 11 21:56:17 <labib>	To be more precise, the file itself isn't empty it just contains the documentation text that it would have prior to account setup
Jul 11 21:57:35 <ddevault>	who is your MTA provider
Jul 11 21:58:45 <labib>	Hi Drew! I'm a Google Apps user (and the admin for the enterprise) and in my first run through the new-account form used my regular Google Apps password. 
Jul 11 21:59:19 <labib>	I have a OTP for the account now, but I can't figure out how to delete the original account in aerc. 
Jul 11 21:59:31 <ddevault>	you have to set up an application password or something
Jul 11 21:59:41 <ddevault>	oh, just remove accounts.conf
Jul 11 21:59:45 <ddevault>	it's in ~/.config/aerc/
Jul 11 21:59:52 <labib>	thank you!
Jul 11 21:59:53 <ddevault>	probably, I dunno what dumb things macOS might do
Jul 11 22:00:27 <labib>	I went digging through /usr/local to find something to edit or delete. Appreciate the help!
Jul 11 22:01:20 <labib>	Removing accounts.conf in ~/.config/aerc worked. Thanks!
Jul 11 22:09:08 <dkess>	are there any current efforts to package aerc for debian? if not i would be willing to look into it
Jul 11 22:09:38 <ddevault>	please do

Jan 02 22:10:16 <gcraggs>	Hi All - Just installed aerc, but when trying to launch it I'm getting "panic: character set not supported". I've tried in both Alacritty and termite. Any suggestions on how to get it working? (aerc -v = 0.3.0)
Jan 02 22:16:43 <bookworm>	what's your TERM/locale?
Jan 02 22:22:16 <gcraggs>	en_GB.UTF_8 - just been digging through the tcell source and tried setting TERM=UTF_8 which solves the issue
Jan 02 22:25:24 <gcraggs>	Not sure if en_GB.UTF_8 is a valid value, or where it's being set though
Jan 02 22:28:32 <bookworm>	not on my system
Jan 02 22:29:05 <bookworm>	what Distro are you on? For me the locale is called en_GB.UTF-8, note the '-' instead of the underscore
Jan 02 22:31:28 <bookworm>	if you have a systemd based distro you can query the locales with `localectl list-locales`
Jan 02 22:36:49 <gcraggs>	I'm using arch. That command lists only the locale you have, so I must have an invalid configuration somewhere. Thanks for helping me! Don't suppose you know where the locale would be set?
Jan 02 22:39:55 <gcraggs>	Nevermind, looks like localectl can set that too. Thanks again for helping!
Jan 02 22:44:30 <bookworm>	that command lists the *available* locales :)
