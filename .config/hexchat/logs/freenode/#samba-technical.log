Feb 19 13:15:15 <Milhouse>	Is it possible to avoid the perl errors with 4.12-rc3? http://ix.io/2c8i
Feb 19 13:16:23 <Milhouse>	We don't have this perl issue when building 4.11.6 so presumably the pidl code isn't always used when building 4.11.6 (perhaps it's now being built incorrectly by 4.12-rc?)
Feb 19 13:24:27 <Milhouse>	Or maybe this commit is relevant: https://github.com/samba-team/samba/commit/83ffe6752d589180eac96d7b8e7d1a54e3476bfd - hmmm, no longer supplied so this is a new dependency.
