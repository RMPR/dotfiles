Jun 17 05:21:37 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Jun 17 05:21:37 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	-  
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Jun 17 05:21:38 *	- software communities since 1998.

Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	-  
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- software communities since 1998.

Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Jun 27 17:33:13 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member

Jul 11 08:41:47 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the

Jul 11 08:41:47 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications

Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Welcome to verne.freenode.net in Amsterdam, NL.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Thanks to http://www.hyperfilter.com/ for sponsoring
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- this server!
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- software communities since 1998.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- If you are looking for assistance, you may be able to find a list of 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	-  
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Jul 12 11:53:50 *	- global notices.

Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Welcome to verne.freenode.net in Amsterdam, NL.
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Thanks to http://www.hyperfilter.com/ for sponsoring

Jul 12 13:33:46 *	-  
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	-  
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- software communities since 1998.

Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further

Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	-  
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Jul 12 13:33:46 *	- global notices.

Oct 12 11:41:17 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Oct 12 11:41:17 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as

Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- software communities since 1998.
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- If you are looking for assistance, you may be able to find a list of 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	-  
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Oct 20 21:40:50 *	- global notices.

Apr 10 19:20:23 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the

Apr 10 19:20:23 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Apr 10 19:20:23 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.

Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- HITCHCOCK, SIR ALFRED [1899 - 1980] Born in Essex,
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- England, Sir Alfred Hitchcock was a noted film director

Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- techniques in film-making, made more than 50 feature films,
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- and influenced many present-day directors and producers.
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	-  
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- software communities since 1998.

Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 11 00:08:21 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as

Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- HITCHCOCK, SIR ALFRED [1899 - 1980] Born in Essex,
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- England, Sir Alfred Hitchcock was a noted film director
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- and producer. Over a long career he pioneered many modern
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- techniques in film-making, made more than 50 feature films,
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- and influenced many present-day directors and producers.
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	-  
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- software communities since 1998.

Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further

Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 11 23:55:05 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as

Apr 12 07:36:33 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 12 07:36:33 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as

Apr 12 08:35:49 *	- HITCHCOCK, SIR ALFRED [1899 - 1980] Born in Essex,
Apr 12 08:35:49 *	- England, Sir Alfred Hitchcock was a noted film director
Apr 12 08:35:49 *	- and producer. Over a long career he pioneered many modern
Apr 12 08:35:49 *	- techniques in film-making, made more than 50 feature films,
Apr 12 08:35:49 *	- and influenced many present-day directors and producers.

Apr 12 08:35:50 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 12 08:35:50 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Apr 12 08:35:50 *	- global notices.

Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- Welcome to barjavel.freenode.net in Paris, FR, EU. 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- Thanks to Bearstech (www.bearstech.com) for sponsoring

Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- BARJAVEL, RENE [1911-1985].  Born in Nyons, he was a

Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- credited with having written the first novel to introduce 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- the Grandfather Paradox in time travel, in his 1943 work 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- 'Le Voyageur imprudent'.
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- software communities since 1998.
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.

Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-  
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	- global notices.
Apr 18 08:58:49 *	-

Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	-  
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 19 21:25:26 *	- software communities since 1998.

Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- livingstone.freenode.net Message of the Day - 
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- Welcome to livingstone.freenode.net in NY, USA.
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- software communities since 1998.
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	-  
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	-  
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	-  
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.

Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member

Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Apr 21 13:50:40 *	- global notices.

Apr 21 15:11:28 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 21 15:11:28 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 21 15:11:28 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further

Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Welcome to verne.freenode.net in Amsterdam, NL.
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Thanks to http://www.hyperfilter.com/ for sponsoring
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- this server!
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	-  
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	-  
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- VERNE, Jules (1828-1905). Born in Nantes, France, Verne was
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- a pioneering french author known for novels such as Twenty
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, A Journey to the Center of the
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Earth, and Around the World in Eighty Days. Often lauded as the
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Father of science fiction, Verne wrote about concepts such as
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- space travel, skyscrapers, and worldwide communications
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- networks long before these ideas became popularised or realised.
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	-  
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- software communities since 1998.
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	-

Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.

Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	-  
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Apr 22 09:26:03 *	- global notices.

Apr 23 14:52:55 *	- Welcome to cherryh.freenode.net in Montreal, CA.
Apr 23 14:52:55 *	- Welcome to freenode - supporting the free and open source
Apr 23 14:52:55 *	- software communities since 1998.
Apr 23 14:52:55 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- By connecting to freenode you indicate that you have read and
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- accept our policies and guidelines as set out on https://freenode.net
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- In the event that you observe behaviour that contravenes our policies,
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- please notify a volunteer staff member via private message, or send us an
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- e-mail to complaints@freenode.net -- we will do our best to address the
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- situation within a reasonable period of time, and we may request further
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- information or, as appropriate, involve other parties such as channel operators 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- Group Contacts representing an on-topic group.
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- freenode runs an open proxy scanner.
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- If you are looking for assistance, you may be able to find a list of 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- volunteer staff on '/stats p' (shows only on-call staff) or by joining 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- #freenode and using the '/who freenode/staff/*' command. You may message
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- any of us at any time. Please note that freenode predominantly provides 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- assistance via private message, and while we have a network channel the 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- primary venue for support requests is via private message to a member 
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- of the volunteer staff team.
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- From time to time, volunteer staff may send server-wide notices relating to
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- the project, or the communities that we host. The majority of such notices
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- will be sent as wallops, and you can '/mode <yournick> +w' to ensure that you
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- global notices.
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- Representing an on-topic project? Don't forget to register, more information
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- can be found on the https://freenode.net website under "Group Registration".
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- Thank you also to our server sponsors for the sustained support in keeping the
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- network going for close to two decades.
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	-  
Apr 23 14:52:56 *	- Thank you for using freenode!

Apr 23 17:38:49 *	- techniques in film-making, made more than 50 feature films,
Apr 23 17:38:49 *	- and influenced many present-day directors and producers.

Apr 23 17:38:49 *	- do not miss them. Important messages relating to the freenode project, including
Apr 23 17:38:50 *	- notices of upcoming maintenance and other scheduled downtime will be issued as
