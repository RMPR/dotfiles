Jul 11 10:14:05 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 12:59:14 <Legitkrillin>	hi all!
Jul 11 12:59:41 <Legitkrillin>	I am properly going to get abused but I need to ask something
Jul 11 13:00:34 <Legitkrillin>	I am a massive fan of Fedora and I have been using it for a very long time I simply love it, I have it on all my systems except one!
Jul 11 13:01:22 <dansimon>	Hi guys, I'm trying to customize my wm startup slightly (adding a xsetroot line), but which conf file should I use... not ~/.xinitrc since im running gdm, no luck hacking /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients... any ideas?
Jul 11 13:01:42 <Legitkrillin>	I was reading something that eventually fedora will be what Silverblue is today
Jul 11 13:01:46 <Legitkrillin>	is that true ?
Jul 11 13:02:11 <Legitkrillin>	is everything going to be containerized ?
Jul 11 13:14:46 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: it depends on how the project keeps proceeding.
Jul 11 13:15:10 <FranciscoD>	At the moment, I don't see the workstation product being replaced by silverblue anytime soon
Jul 11 13:15:29 <Legitkrillin>	but its going that way ?
Jul 11 13:15:44 <FranciscoD>	Lots of things don't need containers, so I expect rpms/dnf will remain
Jul 11 13:16:05 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: hard to say, no formal plans, but may happen in the future if the community decides its better tech etc.
Jul 11 13:16:41 <Legitkrillin>	fair enough
Jul 11 13:16:53 <Legitkrillin>	thank you for the info
Jul 11 13:17:16 <Legitkrillin>	for me f30is the best I have ever used
Jul 11 13:19:10 <Legitkrillin>	ok well thanks a million I hope you all have a good day! ^_^

Jul 11 14:20:11 <coz_>	good morning
Jul 11 14:20:34 <saml>	hi coz_ asl?
Jul 11 14:21:55 <mikeymop>	lol
Jul 11 14:23:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	saml, i am hoping that was a joke
Jul 11 14:23:44 *	mikeymop waits for him to has you the same question
Jul 11 14:24:38 <saml>	what do you use for multitrack audio recording?  recording more than stereo channels
Jul 11 14:26:11 <coz_>	saml,  have you tried ardour?
Jul 11 14:27:19 <coz_>	saml, not sure that's what you want, I hate to say this, but when I was composing, it was on **windows
Jul 11 14:27:23 *	coz_ ducks
Jul 11 14:34:16 <saml>	ardour is much bloated. looks like audacity can do as long as hardware supports
Jul 11 14:35:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	for some reason rosegarden pops into my head
Jul 11 14:36:05 <coz_>	I tried that once, I believe it is a notation app
Jul 11 14:36:16 <coz_>	not positive
Jul 11 14:37:41 <FranciscoD>	Not sure if this is up to date, but worth a check: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Jam_Audio_Spin
Jul 11 14:37:59 <coz_>	saml, you can also look here   https://www.slant.co/topics/6067/~daws-for-linux
Jul 11 14:41:11 <coz_>	saml,  out of curiosity, what type of things are you recording?
Jul 11 14:46:05 <saml>	coz_, i was wondering if I can record stereo keyboard along with vocal mic
Jul 11 14:46:18 <saml>	so, 3 channels
Jul 11 14:47:45 <coz_>	saml,  mm ok, I hate to say this, but on windows I used ntrack studio for such things, on linux, I found ardour to be a bit less user freindly, and I doubt ntrack will work in wine
Jul 11 14:49:06 <coz_>	saml, but i used a roland xv88 for all recordings
Jul 11 14:50:19 <coz_>	sam here are some very old pieces I did   https://soundcloud.com/cozziemoto
Jul 11 14:52:49 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 15:01:13 <rdieter>	ctOS: ~/.xsession-errors may have something
Jul 11 15:03:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: i've got that file but it's 0 bytes
Jul 11 15:04:12 <rdieter>	guessing you're not using sddm then
Jul 11 15:04:38 <ctOS>	rdieter: systemctl confirms that it's running
Jul 11 15:04:39 <rdieter>	gdm?  then ~/.local/share/ somewhere I think
Jul 11 15:05:02 <rdieter>	strange, I've never had an empty .xsession-errors with sddm.  <shrug>
Jul 11 15:05:21 <ctOS>	gdm is installed but not running. I originally had the issue with gdm, and switched to sddm to see if it would work. Same issue.
Jul 11 15:05:51 <ctOS>	rdieter: I deleted the file now and I'm restarting to see if it will be populated on reboot.
Jul 11 15:05:52 <rdieter>	ok, dm has nothing to do with it.
Jul 11 15:06:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I have the same issue in grub too. It's supposed to turn off the screen after 5 min. It turns off and then back on again. Tried using different cables but that didn't help.
Jul 11 15:07:01 <ctOS>	The monitor works as expected with other computers.
Jul 11 15:07:20 <ctOS>	Tried running the Ubuntu live CD but ran into the same issue.
Jul 11 15:07:22 <rdieter>	ctOS: does this work?  xset dpms force off
Jul 11 15:07:28 <rdieter>	that should turn the screen off
Jul 11 15:07:29 <ctOS>	Yes
Jul 11 15:07:42 <rdieter>	and it stays off as expected?
Jul 11 15:07:43 <ctOS>	It turns off for like a minute and then turns back on again.
Jul 11 15:08:10 <rdieter>	ah, then I suspect you may have an application that's waking things up, some active notification perhaps
Jul 11 15:08:14 <ctOS>	I've tried disabling screen locking. With screen locking enabled in KDE settings it doesn't ever power off.
Jul 11 15:08:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked the inactivity timer, and it keeps incrementing as expected. Not being reset when the screen turns back on.
Jul 11 15:09:09 <ctOS>	rdieter: issue also happens when I don't login and just wait on the login screen.
Jul 11 15:09:14 <rdieter>	in system settings, find the power/battery applet
Jul 11 15:09:28 <ctOS>	(I've spent a lot of fruitless time debugging this.) :P
Jul 11 15:09:29 <rdieter>	and click on it, it should show if there's any application supressing power management
Jul 11 15:10:05 <rdieter>	or if any app in panel is blinking
Jul 11 15:10:26 <rdieter>	that's 2 scenarios that could do what you describe
Jul 11 15:10:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked it. It has a check box for turning power savings on and off, and lists VLC when I use it. But I don't normally ruin that and it's not in the list unless when it's expected to be there.
Jul 11 15:10:50 <ctOS>	*normally run that
Jul 11 15:10:59 <rdieter>	vlc will supress power management when playing media, fyi
Jul 11 15:11:15 <rdieter>	(and sometimes even when not playing, quirky bug)
Jul 11 15:11:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: yeah, that's not the issue. I only mentioned it to demonstrate I've seen how the pallet is supposed to work.
Jul 11 15:11:34 <rdieter>	many media players support that these days
Jul 11 15:12:06 <rdieter>	ok, then I'm out of ideas.  that even with xset things don't stay off implies *something* is waking it up
Jul 11 15:12:14 <ctOS>	rdieter: thanks for your many troubleshooting suggestions!
Jul 11 15:12:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I know the screen locking thing wakes it up from observations.
Jul 11 15:13:01 <ctOS>	However, I've not found a log anywhere that says *what's* keep waking it. :-/
Jul 11 15:21:26 <sonik_>	trying another crack at getting my P52 to sleep when I close the lid.  I've looked at logind and confirmed that the lid close event is being generated
Jul 11 15:27:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	ctOS, is this a laptop or desktop
Jul 11 15:28:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, and powertop?
Jul 11 15:29:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, most of the time the issue in not going to sleep but waking up afterwards
Jul 11 15:30:23 <sonik_>	lenovo P52
Jul 11 15:31:45 <sonik_>	if i run `systemctl suspend` works...
Jul 11 15:32:07 <sonik_>	hardware key FN+sleep it works
Jul 11 15:36:55 <sonik_>	Southern_Gentlem, what am I looking for with powertop?  the lid event?
Jul 11 15:42:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, to see it sees anything that is preventing the sleep

Jul 11 19:35:23 <dvheumen>	hi, I am wondering if there is a way to verify installed package for corruptions. I am aware of 'rpm -Va' but it gives results that are hard to interpret. Any other options?
Jul 11 19:37:34 <webdragon>	package nemo-font-manager-0.7.2-4.fc24.noarch requires nemo-python, but none of the providers can be installed  https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/ddU1vwJRcclu-zoItICUdg  Known issue?
Jul 11 19:48:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, f24?
Jul 11 19:49:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon,  file a bugzilla (yes it is in the f30 repos)
Jul 11 19:49:58 <chrisawi>	the src package is font-manager, it looks like has been failing to build since then
Jul 11 19:50:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suspect it will be going away if someone doesnt port it to py3
Jul 11 19:55:32 <webdragon>	Fedora 29, Southern_Gentlem
Jul 11 20:16:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, but that package is f24
Jul 11 20:22:12 <dvheumen>	anyone knows a better way than 'rpm -Va' to verify packages for consistency, corruption, etc.?
Jul 11 20:27:23 <tmz>	dvheumen: That depends on what you don't like about rpm -Va and/or what you're trying to do.
Jul 11 20:28:14 <tmz>	You could use the python rpm bindings if you wanted to adjust the output, as one example.
Jul 11 20:29:49 <dvheumen>	tmz: my issue is specifically with the type of output. It lists the facts of what is changed, timestamps, checksums etc. But from the information I cannot determine whether this is good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:02 <dvheumen>	like, config files may change without it being an issue
Jul 11 20:30:15 <Khaytsus>	Changed is changed.  It's up to you to determine good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:16 <dvheumen>	but binary files you'd expect to be 100% original
Jul 11 20:30:18 <Khaytsus>	It's not an IDS.
Jul 11 20:30:47 <dvheumen>	okay, so there is no tool that takes a bit more of an informed approach to determine if changes are good or bad?
Jul 11 20:31:20 <dvheumen>	I was hoping for something that would indicate: hmm... these files are corrupted, consider reinstalling this package to ensure correct operation. (For example)
Jul 11 20:31:32 <Khaytsus>	No, how would it know if it's "corrupted"
Jul 11 20:31:53 <dvheumen>	checksum mismatch for binary files?
Jul 11 20:32:00 <dvheumen>	or file missing
Jul 11 20:32:54 <dvheumen>	(it may not cover 100% of package)
Jul 11 20:32:59 <Khaytsus>	It tells you if it's a config, etc....
Jul 11 20:33:14 <dvheumen>	hmmm ...
Jul 11 20:33:35 <dvheumen>	maybe there are some reasonable automated conclusions when parsing the 'rpm -Va' result
Jul 11 20:33:55 <Khaytsus>	You should not have a million rusults in rpm -Va
Jul 11 20:34:15 <Khaytsus>	It's not hard.  What are you actually trying to do, do intruction detection?  If so, rpm -Va is not what you want.
Jul 11 20:35:35 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: intrusion detection would be nice, but very difficult to do on the pc itself. (you'd need an independent, reliable source)
Jul 11 20:36:05 <Khaytsus>	An IDS will track all files, not just files managed by an RPM.  And if the file changes, it can warn.
Jul 11 20:36:09 <dvheumen>	but in case of corrupted files, i.e. disk failing, bad power cut-offs, etc
Jul 11 20:36:24 <Khaytsus>	rpm -Va is not appropriate for any of that.
Jul 11 20:36:41 <dvheumen>	okay, what would you suggest to discover corruption due to issues in hardware/software?
Jul 11 20:36:48 <dvheumen>	... hardware/power/etc.
Jul 11 20:36:48 <Khaytsus>	Is that a real problem??
Jul 11 20:37:27 <dvheumen>	I have had my doubts due to vague kernel messages that aren't conclusively saying "this shit is bad", but it does list a "Corrupted" error that is "recovered"
Jul 11 20:37:40 <Khaytsus>	So you have broken hardware
Jul 11 20:37:50 <Khaytsus>	Could you please just start with the problem, not XY
Jul 11 20:37:51 *	Khaytsus points to http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341 and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
Jul 11 20:38:20 <Khaytsus>	If you ahve broken hardware, fix it.  Run filesystem checks.  then rpm -Va is useful.
Jul 11 20:38:40 <Khaytsus>	But only for RPM-managed files.  And how do you know if a config file is modified, or corrupt.  You don't.  There's no way to tell
Jul 11 20:39:30 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: I asked about 'rpm -Va' to explore my options. For my specific problem: "pcieport ....: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, ..."
Jul 11 20:39:54 <dvheumen>	but then there are a lot of those, and it is hard to check if there are consequences to this
Jul 11 20:40:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, sounds like you need to test the memory and the har drive
Jul 11 20:40:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	hard
Jul 11 20:40:44 <dvheumen>	true, but I haven't found any conclusive evidence that something is wrong
Jul 11 20:41:00 <dvheumen>	I am worried a bit about silent corruptions
Jul 11 20:41:11 <dvheumen>	that's where I figured the checksums of rpm packages may come in handy
Jul 11 20:41:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	if the hardware is faulty how can you trust the software reports from it
Jul 11 20:43:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	the software is telling you something is wrong with the hardware
Jul 11 20:45:04 <dvheumen>	well, the thing is, those messages are more common than you'd think. Apparently it is not necessarily bad. And if this is true, you can at least detect if data is written incorrectly to a persistent store after reading it back
Jul 11 20:47:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, we are not here to argue with you, test your hardware and come back then we can go from there, (have results that we can look at )

Jul 11 21:19:00 <dvheumen>	Southern_Gentlem: anywhere I can find info on what has changed in the respins? I see the kernel only mentioned in the README, but I suspect there've been more changes
Jul 11 21:24:57 <Khaytsus>	dvheumen: any package updates since gold was made..
Jul 11 21:27:57 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: ow wow, so you follow all the updates. Thanks. I did not expect that much change :-P
Jul 11 21:40:58 <ePirat>	Hi
Jul 11 21:41:02 <ePirat>	Are there some packaging guidelines for stuff that uses GNUStep?
Jul 11 21:41:18 <ePirat>	I could only find https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/GNUstep which has no definitive info whatsoever
Jul 11 21:43:51 <sdgathman>	Is there a way to update Fedora with no IP4 connectivity?
Jul 11 21:44:42 <sdgathman>	Eh, some of the mirrors do have IPv6 - I don't know why it can't look them up...
Jul 11 21:52:39 <sdgathman>	ISP nameservers won't return IPv6 results...
Jul 11 21:52:59 <sdgathman>	Had to use my own recursive resolver over darknet
Jul 11 21:53:37 <sdgathman>	You may ask, "Huh?  IPv6 only?  Nameserver won't do IPv6?"
Jul 11 21:54:13 <sdgathman>	They charge a euro/month for each IP4, IP6 is free.  Simple profit motive.
Jul 11 21:57:06 <jidar>	what's wild to me is they don't have a IPv4 to IPv6 tunnel/proxy/whatever its called
Jul 11 21:57:31 <jidar>	my isp gives me a IPv6 but I can hit IPv4 sites all day
Jul 11 22:12:38 <Khaytsus>	Because $sdgathman
Jul 11 23:30:14 <mozzarella>	anyone familiar with libreoffice writer?
Jul 11 23:31:42 <coz_>	mozzarella,  I rarely use it and sometimes actually uninstall it, but is there an issue?

Jul 11 23:37:00 <chrisawi>	but a word processor doesn't really have discrete pages

Jul 12 08:07:22 <latenite>	Hi folks, I have installed a minimal fedora server and now I want it to have X. So I installed i3 (a tiling WM). After running 'startx' I get: "xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1193 does not exist"
Jul 12 08:08:17 <latenite>	after that and 4 longer waiting periods with: "xauth: timeout in locking file /Xauthority"
Jul 12 08:08:30 <latenite>	I get a blac screen...no Desktop no mouse no TTY
Jul 12 08:08:37 <latenite>	What am I missing here?
Jul 12 08:23:27 <grift>	probably xauth latenite
Jul 12 08:23:50 <grift>	xorh-x11-xauth
Jul 12 08:24:31 <grift>	actually i suppose yuo do have it
Jul 12 08:25:48 <grift>	you probably should start it like: startx /usr/bin/i3 (unlesss you have a .xinitrc file)
Jul 12 08:29:26 <latenite>	grift, I have xauth installed
Jul 12 08:29:52 <grift>	did you try `startx /usr/bin/i3`?
Jul 12 08:30:17 <latenite>	and I have .xinitrc with 'exec i3 -c /home/jd/.i3/config'
Jul 12 08:30:34 <latenite>	grift, no let me try that...
Jul 12 08:31:01 <grift>	well if you have an .xinitrc then it shoul work without /usr/bin/i3 , but try it anyway
Jul 12 08:31:28 <latenite>	it sais: xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1518 does not exist
Jul 12 08:31:54 <latenite>	and then timesout with : xauth timeout in locking authority file ?Xauthority
Jul 12 08:32:15 <latenite>	4 long times (*like 10 sec)
Jul 12 08:32:33 <latenite>	then I see a few X messages and get a totally black screen
Jul 12 08:32:40 <latenite>	no mouse no login nothing
Jul 12 08:33:07 <grift>	strange ... i use startx all the time with awesomewm and it works fine here so its not broken
Jul 12 08:33:22 <latenite>	I can do 'killall Xorg" from another tty and see that X terminated
Jul 12 08:33:40 <grift>	it should create the .serverauth file
Jul 12 08:33:47 <grift>	xauth
Jul 12 08:35:34 <grift>	you have these installed?:
Jul 12 08:36:09 <grift>	-driver -xinit -xauth -server-Xorg
Jul 12 08:37:02 <grift>	-drivers*
Jul 12 08:37:54 <grift>	but seems to me that theres a problem with xauth other than that i am not sure
Jul 12 08:38:22 <latenite>	I checked and I was missing -drivers*
Jul 12 08:38:26 <latenite>	I have them now
Jul 12 08:38:53 <latenite>	the problem remains though
Jul 12 08:39:27 <grift>	are there any .serverauth files in /home/jd lingering?
Jul 12 08:40:39 <latenite>	no none
Jul 12 08:40:41 <grift>	i ran out of clues though, this should just work: `startx /usr/bin/i3`

Jul 12 11:55:03 <gidna>	now I get Error: Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'fedora'
Jul 12 12:00:45 <gidna>	this fedora 30 is buggy
Jul 12 12:02:41 <slidercrank>	gidna, try again. I get this error sometimes. But trying again fixes it
Jul 12 12:03:34 <gidna>	the other method is switch-off /on
Jul 12 12:04:22 <alexcleac>	gidna: are you sure you don't have connectivity issues if it still doesn't work after retry?
Jul 12 12:06:45 <_val_>	maybe dnf clean cache or all ?
Jul 12 12:07:10 <gidna>	I'll try later maybe there's some congestion
Jul 12 12:08:36 <FranciscoD>	that's shouldn't be an OS issue, probably a networking one
Jul 12 12:08:42 <FranciscoD>	either a bad mirror or just bad connectivity
Jul 12 12:08:57 <FranciscoD>	switching on and off should not really have an effect on that one either
Jul 12 12:09:52 <alexcleac>	It may help though. If the networking issue was caused by dns cache or whatever related to local level
Jul 12 12:10:26 <alexcleac>	But there are always ways to find out debug those issues without switching on and off :)
Jul 12 12:12:14 <hortiel>	I'd like to know about more such /sys/ or other files if any? how would I get a list of them?
Jul 12 12:12:27 <hortiel>	monitor changing and controlling hooks
Jul 12 12:13:13 <hortiel>	any people's who know how to change the pixels?
Jul 12 12:13:35 <hortiel>	for example I'd like to control the gpu to output certain pixels to monitors
Jul 12 12:16:50 <slidercrank>	hortiel, how do you want to achieve that?
Jul 12 12:18:45 <hortiel>	slidercrank: via some files
Jul 12 12:18:50 <janos_>	..
Jul 12 12:18:51 <hortiel>	what are my options
Jul 12 12:19:19 <hortiel>	for example if I don't know that a backlight file at  a location exist, how'd i know about those?
Jul 12 12:19:29 <slidercrank>	if you want to control certain pixels, you should do it in the kernel driver, I think. You cannot access pixels directly otherwise. Well, you could use SVGAlib to have a low-level access to the video memory. Or have a full control in MS-DOS
Jul 12 12:19:29 <hortiel>	i'd like to employ a similar search functionality
Jul 12 12:20:27 <hortiel>	how to do it in driver
Jul 12 12:20:48 <slidercrank>	write your own driver
Jul 12 12:21:17 <hortiel>	but I can easily access the bit in disk without writing a driver because it's already provided... I am sure others have already built the drivers
Jul 12 12:22:01 <hortiel>	you don't write your own driver, if I wrote the driver I provide it to the whole world, and linux already has development done on top of that... just need the hooks
Jul 12 12:23:14 <slidercrank>	I have doubt that is applicable to modern GPUs. That would be epicaly slow.
Jul 12 12:23:16 <hortiel>	/dev/sda already gives low level control..
Jul 12 12:23:29 <hortiel>	so I doubt it there are none in the kernel
Jul 12 12:24:04 <hortiel>	Is there a channel where I can meet kernel devs or linux kernel channel?
Jul 12 12:24:13 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:24:39 <slidercrank>	but where do you want to control individual pixels? Under X?
Jul 12 12:25:32 <hortiel>	so that I can get some low level control similar to device files!!
Jul 12 12:25:46 <slidercrank>	:)
Jul 12 12:25:49 <hortiel>	yes slidercrank
Jul 12 12:26:00 <slidercrank>	that is not going to happen
Jul 12 12:26:31 <hortiel>	:(
Jul 12 12:26:41 <slidercrank>	but the channel is #kernel
Jul 12 12:27:24 <hortiel>	can I mail linux devs?
Jul 12 12:27:41 <hortiel>	I'd like to ask if they've already known something similar.
Jul 12 12:27:44 <slidercrank>	yes, but I am afraid they will laugh at the request
Jul 12 12:27:48 <alexcleac>	I think there is a way to control every pixel on kernel level, otherwise, the X11, Mir and Wayland wouldn't be possible
Jul 12 12:27:59 <slidercrank>	And there are hundreds emails a day
Jul 12 12:28:29 <slidercrank>	hortiel, lkml
Jul 12 12:28:34 <slidercrank>	linux kernel maillist
Jul 12 12:29:31 <slidercrank>	it feels like you are doing something the wrong way
Jul 12 12:29:49 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I find nothing funny about it. I wish you could take me seriously. before writing my own kernel code- I'd first like to figure out it's components low -level ones, and use them first.
Jul 12 12:30:12 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I do manipulate individual bits, using /dev/sda ... what's wrong? are you kidding me?
Jul 12 12:30:22 <slidercrank>	maybe study the graphics stack first? Writing a driver isn't an easy thing
Jul 12 12:30:22 <hortiel>	I'd do low level access for education use.
Jul 12 12:30:45 <slidercrank>	hortiel, then MS-DOS would be the best choice! Full control of everything!
Jul 12 12:30:54 <hortiel>	slidercrank: wtf
Jul 12 12:31:16 <slidercrank>	nothing impedes your games with hardware.
Jul 12 12:31:31 <slidercrank>	direct access to every register.
Jul 12 12:31:44 <hortiel>	in ms-dos?
Jul 12 12:31:49 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:32:03 <alexcleac>	I think in FreeDOS you can have this too :)
Jul 12 12:32:03 <slidercrank>	or freedos (which is basically the same)
Jul 12 12:32:29 <hortiel>	hmm, interesting, which cmd ? do I have to run ms-dos on top of linux or baremetal?
Jul 12 12:32:54 <slidercrank>	no, not under any OS. Load it directly
Jul 12 12:33:16 <slidercrank>	or better use a Virtual Machine
Jul 12 12:33:35 <slidercrank>	hardware is well-emulated
Jul 12 12:34:14 <hortiel>	VM too is running "under" an OS.
Jul 12 12:34:28 <hortiel>	or better said on top of it
Jul 12 12:34:36 <slidercrank>	yes, but hardware is emulated well. That's enough for educational purposes
Jul 12 12:34:48 <hortiel>	ok. which cmd to do that
Jul 12 12:35:08 <slidercrank>	you can use VirtualBox or QEMU
Jul 12 12:35:35 <slidercrank>	knowing Assembly would be beneficial
Jul 12 12:37:01 <slidercrank>	hortiel, but what are you trying to achieve?
Jul 12 12:38:53 <slidercrank>	why can't you use SDL/OpenGL or any another graphics lib?
Jul 12 12:39:34 <hortiel>	slidercrank: sorry, I was just fascinated how I could change the bytes in /dev/sda and would like to "extend MY REACH" further down the rabbit hole.
Jul 12 12:40:15 <hortiel>	don't know C
Jul 12 12:40:20 <slidercrank>	not everything is a file in the Linux world (the concept everything is a file was extended in Plan9).
Jul 12 12:40:32 <slidercrank>	the network card is not a file, for example
Jul 12 12:40:52 <hortiel>	no in /dev I can *tons* of networking files...
Jul 12 12:41:01 <hortiel>	they are unbuffered though.
Jul 12 12:41:12 <slidercrank>	the same is the GPU. Something may be exposed with a file system. But not what you want
Jul 12 12:42:27 <slidercrank>	you cannot send a file over network by running # cat ~/cat_pix.gz > /dev/eth0
Jul 12 12:46:36 <hortiel>	are there any other tcp interfaces through which I can do that?
Jul 12 12:46:38 <hortiel>	surely there are
Jul 12 12:47:13 <slidercrank>	not via the file system
Jul 12 12:48:20 <slidercrank>	you have to communicate with the kernel. usually via a library.
Jul 12 12:49:44 <slidercrank>	that's the purpose or the division into the kernel space and userspace. Everything relating to hardware is done in the kernel space. You (from userspace) can only beg the kernel (via its driver) to do something for you. you cannot control hw registers directly
Jul 12 12:49:55 <slidercrank>	*purpose of
Jul 12 12:50:51 <slidercrank>	some interfaces are exposed via the file system. As in /dev/[hs]d[a-z][0-9].
Jul 12 13:13:37 <hortiel>	slidercrank: what If I use mknod to make some files, and then control it without using libs

Jul 12 13:18:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel, if you are wanting to recreate the wheel that is fine, not much we can do to help you in this channel
Jul 12 13:19:34 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: no I don't want to , just use existing tools, like mknode and simple commands without *code* hence no recreating.
Jul 12 13:19:51 <hortiel>	basically trivial ways to do stuff
Jul 12 13:20:08 <hortiel>	such as writing/reading files or some other simple cmd
Jul 12 13:20:13 <hortiel>	thast's it!!
Jul 12 13:20:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel,  so trival then why are you asking
Jul 12 13:20:44 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: ?? because it can be done trivially after discovering it, not before

Jul 12 13:45:54 <sdgathman>	hortiel: to send a file over tcp I use nc
Jul 12 13:46:12 <sdgathman>	From the nmap-ncat package
Jul 12 13:46:38 <sdgathman>	nc 1.2.3.4 1234 <file
Jul 12 13:46:57 <sdgathman>	and on the other end, nc -l
Jul 12 13:48:24 <sdgathman>	If both ends are using an end-to-end encrypted VPN, then the transfer is even secure.
Jul 12 13:48:55 <Khaytsus>	That's utterly insane.

Jul 12 14:39:19 <Khaytsus>	essich1: You're 100% nobody has done this?  Often people ask these questions and it already exists in COPR, etc.
Jul 12 14:50:20 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: This is quite complicated! To add the package, I need an account (okay), need to sign a CLA (why?) and this needs approval.
Jul 12 14:52:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	because other wise the wiki gets filled with spam/pornbots
Jul 12 14:53:48 <essich1>	Maybe. But for e.g. Guix one simply needs to send an email to the bug tracker - no hazzle at all.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: Thansk, but I'm giving up on this. Can't log-in. "your account must have at least one non cla* group to be able to login and edit" Whatever this means -  seams to be for experts only.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Is there another way to propose a package?

Jul 12 15:20:09 <Khaytsus>	Plus GDPR does not require you don't log it, as long as the logs are secure and not stored.
Jul 12 15:24:05 <essich1>	Khaytsus: I'm not going to discuss the GDPR, how to read it or how to configure apache - YMMV.
Jul 12 15:24:06 <essich1>	The link you posted removes the IP- address, while many admins want to keep an anonymizes one (e.g. for rough geo-location).

Jul 12 15:49:10 <prussian>	for such a small thing, you might be ebtter off standing up your own repo or just having customers use pip or some other packaging tool directly =/

Jul 15 20:28:30 <RagingBuffalo>	try again something else....
Jul 15 20:29:04 <RagingBuffalo>	I'm still on that "No input" with that T480s, fedora 30 and the official thunderbolt dockng station lenovo
Jul 15 20:29:14 <RagingBuffalo>	tried since 08h45 am
Jul 15 20:30:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	what were you doing using rufus
Jul 15 20:31:21 <RagingBuffalo>	I went trying to have a live bootable usb with windows, so I could flash the docking station firmware
Jul 15 20:34:07 <RagingBuffalo>	Wasted most of my time with that piece of junkware
Jul 15 20:34:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	will it work with the fwupdate in fedora
Jul 15 20:34:44 <RagingBuffalo>	They event give some sort of poor warning, you need to modify file stupi1dfyle.sys, with changing 1809 by 1803, otherwise you get bluescreen.
Jul 15 20:34:52 <RagingBuffalo>	There was no such 1809 in the file!!
Jul 15 20:35:11 <RagingBuffalo>	No idea, can we update the docking station with "FW update"?
Jul 15 20:35:45 <RagingBuffalo>	I tried numerous options, boltctl, display link drivers in dnf, etc...
Jul 15 20:35:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	you tell us
Jul 15 20:36:28 <RagingBuffalo>	Hm, I don't thnk it can do for the docking firmware.
Jul 15 20:36:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Jul 15 20:36:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	crap
Jul 15 20:36:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	fwupd.x86_64 : Firmware update daemon
Jul 15 20:37:26 <RagingBuffalo>	hm... can I upload a fw of a docking through vibox?
Jul 15 20:37:34 <RagingBuffalo>	from theVM? I doubt it
Jul 15 20:39:50 <RagingBuffalo>	According to this it's only laptops
Jul 15 20:39:51 <RagingBuffalo>	https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devicelist
Jul 15 20:39:56 <RagingBuffalo>	not docking station
Jul 15 20:40:00 <RagingBuffalo>	(from lenovo)
Jul 15 20:41:15 <RagingBuffalo>	Well thanks for the help Southern_Gentlem, I finished for today, I'm at it since 08h45am I will try again tomorrow
Jul 15 20:43:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	RagingBuffalo, is this a fresh install that has been updated ?
Jul 15 20:43:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	also was the docking station plugged in during the install
Jul 15 20:45:58 <Khaytsus>	fwupd is useless for everything I've ever tried
Jul 15 20:46:06 <Khaytsus>	It lists a bunch of stuff but can't update any of it

Jul 15 21:23:21 <MrMc>	I just have installed a library in /usr/local/lib64 did ldconfig but still get bladeRF-cli: error while loading shared libraries: libbladeRF.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Jul 15 21:28:05 <prussian>	MrMc: do you have libbladeRF.so.2 in any particular location along your ld.so.conf declared paths?
Jul 15 21:29:08 <prussian>	well, if you put it /usr/{local/}lib64 it should have worked
Jul 15 21:29:35 <prussian>	have you tried using LD_LIBRARY_PATH just for the sake of sanity?
Jul 15 21:33:50 <MrMc>	I put it in /usr/local/lib64 and it did not work
Jul 15 21:34:39 <MrMc>	I have just installed it in /usr/lib64 and it works
Jul 15 21:35:53 <prussian>	might want to add a ld.so.conf for that then
Jul 15 21:36:15 <mroche>	I don't believe /usr/local/* is on the LD_PATH by default. At least it isn't on RHEL 7
Jul 15 21:36:26 <mroche>	I could be wrong...
Jul 15 21:36:53 <prussian>	/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF with /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF and just drop libbladeRF.so into /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF
Jul 15 21:36:57 <prussian>	then ldconfig
Jul 15 21:37:07 <prussian>	well, /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF.conf
Jul 15 21:40:39 <MrMc>	@prussian Thank you. I think installing in /usr/lib64 is easier
Jul 15 21:49:07 <Khaytsus>	Or just run it like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path blackRF-cli
Jul 15 23:53:02 <RayTracer>	My upgrade from F29 to F30 didn't go so well. After ~1h I found `enforcing=0` and I could use the system again. Boot log contains lots of "avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 tcontext= tclass=dbus" messages. Is such an issue known?
Jul 15 23:55:53 <dowdle>	RayTracer: First time I've heard of it... but... you should be able to do a relabel and see if that helps.
Jul 15 23:57:04 <linuxmodder>	seems I got clobbered in that netsplit too :(
Jul 16 00:00:52 <RayTracer>	dowdle: I did `touch /.autorelabel` but I think I'll defer the reboot to the next kernel update
Jul 16 00:01:20 <dowdle>	RayTracer: Manually reboot.
Jul 16 00:03:37 <RayTracer>	ok, I'm curious.. brb hopefully
Jul 16 00:11:47 <RayTracer>	dowdle: the relabel unfortunately didn't fix it
Jul 16 00:16:58 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've had an issue with the live media of my personal remix of Workstation having an SELinux issue... but I don't think it is related to your issue.  What types of errors do you see when trying to boot with SELinux on?
Jul 16 00:18:34 <RayTracer>	the system seems to boot normally, but doesn't run graphical login (lightdm), and trying multi-user.target I get a login prompt that doesn't log me in
Jul 16 00:18:51 <RayTracer>	sshd accepts my connection but doesn't present a shell as well
Jul 16 00:21:56 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've done quite a few F2x -> F30 updates but not any recently.
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	according to the AVC messages something, or nothing, can talk to dbus?
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	"avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:xdm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext= tclass=dbus permissive=1 exe="/usr/bin/dbus-broker" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'"

Jul 16 00:38:43 <RayTracer>	as root, using sudo -i
Jul 16 00:39:22 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  confirm it ran please ls -A /root | grep -i '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:39:33 <linuxmodder>	as root or sudo -i of course
Jul 16 00:41:10 <linuxmodder>	my apoligizes sudo ls -lA / | grep '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:42:19 <RayTracer>	fwiw, this is the failed boot log https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/HoRrrmvTb4cdRB62vvNn6A
Jul 16 00:42:43 <RayTracer>	linuxmodder: that grep doesn't show anything
Jul 16 00:43:11 <RayTracer>	it did the relabel process, I watched it on the screen
Jul 16 00:43:55 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  what locked down craziness are you running on that box ? :P
Jul 16 00:44:56 <linuxmodder>	looks more like a mdadm selinux fail first
Jul 16 00:45:19 <RayTracer>	ah, I have /proc mounted with hidepid=2 as an additional oddity
Jul 16 00:46:06 <linuxmodder>	the neednet=  ....  was crazy in itself
Jul 16 00:46:55 <RayTracer>	I don't know why multipath is in play at all..
Jul 16 00:47:11 <linuxmodder>	it is tho which is odd
Jul 16 00:47:23 <linuxmodder>	and that seems to be piling up to the dbus X11 part
Jul 16 00:47:33 <linuxmodder>	not seeing any smoking guns tho as to why
Jul 16 00:47:39 <RayTracer>	that line is needed unfortunately, because the dracut scripts insists on persisting the cmdline config to disk
Jul 16 00:48:11 <linuxmodder>	which part?
Jul 16 00:48:18 <linuxmodder>	the neednet part?
Jul 16 00:48:21 <RayTracer>	so I need to specify full network there, and not just the part needed for being able to ssh
Jul 16 00:48:23 <RayTracer>	yes
Jul 16 00:48:35 <linuxmodder>	that is insanity

Oct 11 15:54:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, use fpaste
Oct 11 16:05:00 <RMPR>	Hello, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask but when I install hadoop suite with: dnf install "hadoop-*", I'm not able to use it with the default system jdk (8). I tried "import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;" and I get the error: "WordCount.java:4: error: package org.apache.hadoop.fs does not exist"
Oct 11 16:08:38 <RMPR>	I got this working with the manual install of hadoop (which is very painful) but then what is the purpose of having hadoop inside the main repository if it doesn't work ? 
Oct 11 16:09:05 <Lutinmalin>	here goes Southern_Gentlem https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/6YzDlNmg9GUC29g1M-evig
Oct 11 16:10:53 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Honestly, I'm not sure Fedora is the first place I'd go to for something like hadoop.  Unless you're setting up ephemeral VMs and tearing them down later.  Fedora has a fairly short life cycle, and hadoop is, to my general knowledge, pretty large data sets that likely live a long time.
Oct 11 16:11:55 <RMPR>	I thought about this channel because well, it's available on the main repos.
Oct 11 16:12:05 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: is there a readme in the hadoop package?
Oct 11 16:12:14 <FranciscoD>	Sometimes even after installation, some manual steps are required
Oct 11 16:12:38 <FranciscoD>	Generally maintainers put these steps in "README.Fedora" files in the packages
Oct 11 16:12:42 <RMPR>	I'm not sure how to verify this 
Oct 11 16:12:59 <FranciscoD>	rpm -qd <package> or look in /usr/share/doc/hadoop*
Oct 11 16:13:35 <FranciscoD>	Ah, also worth noting that hadoop is now orphaned: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/hadoop
Oct 11 16:13:51 <FranciscoD>	no builds for f31
Oct 11 16:14:50 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: what fedora releas are you on?
Oct 11 16:15:00 <RMPR>	fedora 30 workstation
Oct 11 16:15:37 <FranciscoD>	that's the last release with hadoop from the looks of it
Oct 11 16:16:44 <RMPR>	FranciscoD hadoop 2.7.6
Oct 11 16:16:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, thank you that way we dont get all the spam
Oct 11 16:16:54 <leden>	Lutinmalin: check 'tweaks' for 'suspend when laptop lid is closed' is on -- General
Oct 11 16:18:04 <RMPR>	FranciscoD even the NOTICE.TXT isn't that useful
Oct 11 16:18:24 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: yeh, it's unmaintained, so I don't expect it to be in good shape
Oct 11 16:20:01 <FranciscoD>	https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/hadoop/overview/
Oct 11 16:22:32 <Lutinmalin>	leden, not sure I understood you. I picked "suspend" in the power management settings. I also tried 'hibernate'
Oct 11 16:23:12 <Lutinmalin>	(I'm on LXQT)
Oct 11 16:24:19 <leden>	Lutinmalin: oh sorry i was think you running workstation
Oct 11 16:24:33 <Lutinmalin>	no worries
Oct 11 16:25:22 <Peetz0r>	hey! Is there a list of current fedora 31 release blocking bugs somewhere?
Oct 11 16:26:03 <FranciscoD>	Peetz0r: https://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs/
Oct 11 16:27:08 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Not saying it won't work or is a terrible idea.. just that Fedora has a fairly fast life cycle compared to RHEL or CentOS etc.

Oct 11 20:52:17 <josvuk>	plocki: should i deaktivate it?
Oct 11 20:55:59 <plocki>	josvuk: first check if you are running openssh-server
Oct 11 20:56:56 <josvuk>	plocki: how to check it?

Oct 11 21:01:22 <plocki>	josvuk: i just checked my f30 desktop machine: sshd is not running by default. so you need to make it start: systemctl enable sshd

Oct 11 21:08:05 <josvuk>	no, i am on guest fedora30 ...
Oct 11 21:11:55 <josvuk>	but tried it now from cygwin prompt and from win10 comand prompt both the result from ssh josef@localhost -p 2222 is connection refused.
Oct 11 21:12:36 <josvuk>	from the host where virtualbox is running ...
Oct 11 21:14:04 <plocki>	josvuk: hm. does it work from guest host itself? ssh localhost
Oct 11 21:19:52 <josvuk>	plocki: Yes, it works i get a ssh connection from the host operating system Win10home to guest fedora30
Oct 11 21:20:39 <plocki>	josvuk:OK! if you want to connect from another host (i missed that point) you need to change the virtual-box nat rule: change host IP 127.0.0.1 to according local IP of Vbox-Host.
Oct 11 21:21:28 <plocki>	josvuk: after that you should reach yout box by ssh user@ip.of.xbox.host -p 2222
Oct 11 21:23:15 <josvuk>	hm, o.k can i simply add a new portforwarding rule?
Oct 11 21:23:59 <plocki>	josvuk: yes. and you need an according firewall rule on the windows box

Oct 11 21:34:01 <dowdle>	Figured it out (how to get a Let's Encrypt SSL cert for an unreachable server).  As long as you can make a DNS TXT record for the unreachable host you can do it with the following form:
Oct 11 21:34:10 <dowdle>	certbot -d www.whatever.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
Oct 11 21:34:18 <dowdle>	Then it'll spit out what DNS TXT record it wants with value it gives.
Oct 11 21:44:50 <yasumi2136>	i installed vim and without create ~/.vimrc i find it is already well-configured to edit JavaScript file (with indent, color syntax and so on) but i just want to modify the tabstop/shiftwidth to set it to 4. To try out, i created a ~/.vimrc with theses options but all configuration is modified
Oct 11 21:44:58 <yasumi2136>	how to change the indent tab option by keeping this default configuration provided by Fedora
Oct 11 22:30:10 <sdk>	Does anyone know could cause `Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1`. It prevents me from opening an application and I need to reboot. I've searched on the internet but what I found is related to ssh X forwarding. However, I don't use it.
Oct 11 22:32:20 <bugs_>	i've seen that where the home directory is read only
Oct 11 22:32:54 <sdk>	Nope. I have write permission.
Oct 11 22:33:14 <bugs_>	try ssh -x
Oct 11 22:33:54 <sdk>	bugs_: I got the error without using ssh.
Oct 11 22:34:22 <bugs_>	look at the owner and permissions on ~/.Xauthority
Oct 11 22:35:22 <bugs_>	check your DISPLAY environment variable too
Oct 11 22:37:13 <sdk>	DISPLAY is good and .Xauthority has 600. Should the permission be different?
Oct 11 22:37:20 <bugs_>	nope
Oct 11 22:37:47 <bugs_>	do you have an XAUTHORITY environment variable?
Oct 11 22:38:25 <sdk>	Yes. It returns the PATH of Xauthority file
Oct 11 22:39:36 <bugs_>	does it show a path of /run/user/nnnn/gdm/Xauthority?
Oct 11 22:39:41 <bugs_>	or a home directory path
Oct 11 22:39:58 <bugs_>	(i am assuming you are using Xorg and not Wayland)
Oct 11 22:41:52 <sdk>	homedir path. I don't have a Display Manager nor a DE. I autostart X in .bash_profile.
Oct 11 22:42:31 <bugs_>	so your .bash_profile/.bashrc is setting XAUTHORITY?
Oct 11 22:43:14 <bugs_>	if it is try commenting that out log out log back in
Oct 11 22:43:20 <sdk>	.bash_profile run `startx`
Oct 11 22:43:41 <sdk>	but there's nothing about .Xauthority in it.
Oct 11 22:46:06 <bugs_>	your DISPLAY is ":0"?
Oct 11 22:46:14 <sdk>	Yep
Oct 11 22:46:36 <bugs_>	bummer - the only other thing i can think of is some kind of file lock
Oct 11 22:46:43 <bugs_>	is the home directory on an nfs volume?
Oct 11 22:47:10 <sdk>	Nope. ext4 in LVM
Oct 11 22:47:51 <bugs_>	rofl how about two users with the same uid
Oct 11 22:48:31 <bugs_>	something is stopping the software from reading the contents of .Xauthority
Oct 11 22:48:40 <bugs_>	or the contents of .Xauthority don't match
Oct 11 22:49:03 <bugs_>	i've also seen that when the home dir volume was 100% full
Oct 11 22:49:19 <Peetz0r>	Hey! I just upgraded to F31, but display color profiles and night light seem to be broken. I found this bug online and it is reported as "already fixed" yesterday. I think it's this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760254
Oct 11 22:49:36 <Peetz0r>	so why is it still broken on my system? I did upgrade everything and reboot
Oct 11 22:49:42 <sdk>	bugs_: Plenty of space. I'll check the id thingy
Oct 11 22:50:10 <bugs_>	yeah if you have two different usernames logged in with the same uid that
Oct 11 22:50:12 <bugs_>	can do it
Oct 11 22:51:09 <Peetz0r>	according to https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/desktop-linux/1131732-gnome-shell-mutter-3-34-1-deliver-on-their-prominent-fixes/page3 the fixes should have been available as updates yesterday already
Oct 11 22:51:32 <sdk>	bugs_: nope it isn't the id.
Oct 11 22:52:08 <bugs_>	i guess next i'd run "lsof | grep Xauthority
Oct 11 22:52:16 <sdk>	Strange. I run mostly the same settings on Debian and Arch without any trouble :/
Oct 11 22:52:18 <bugs_>	see if something else has it open
Oct 11 22:52:36 <bugs_>	do you have a config file in your .ssh
Oct 11 22:52:52 <sdk>	Yes I have.
Oct 11 22:53:06 <Peetz0r>	in other news, is koji offline?
Oct 11 22:53:43 <bugs_>	i might rename that config temporarily and see if that helps
Oct 11 22:54:01 <bugs_>	outer limits music is starting to play
Oct 11 22:55:20 <sdk>	Yep that's weird because I can pinpoint what's triggering it. I'll try renaming the file but I'll have to wait a bit to see if it will happen again. Thanks for the help.
Oct 11 22:55:33 <bugs_>	ok weird problem
Oct 11 22:55:59 <bugs_>	i worry about algo changes in ssh and ssl triggering something like this
Oct 11 22:56:27 <bugs_>	sometimes they disable a cipher you are using etc
Oct 11 22:57:16 <sdk>	We'll see. I'll try to remember what i'm doing right before it happens.
Oct 11 22:57:38 <bugs_>	oh i've had that happen when i su
Oct 11 23:28:24 <fdelapena>	hey guys are you able to dnf install python3-slugify or is also broken for you?

Oct 12 00:09:36 <nbags>	i've just switched to gnome-shell. having an issue where the Super-#keys (e.g. Super-1 to launch the first favourite app in the panel) is clashing with shortcuts i've created to switch between workspaces. how do i disable these favourite app shortcuts?
Oct 12 00:17:55 <kk4ewt>	settings keyboard-shortcuts
Oct 12 00:22:11 <nbags>	kk4ewt: where? i can't see an option to disable these favourites shortcuts
Oct 12 00:23:26 <kk4ewt>	there is always the tweaktool and gnomeshell-extensions
Oct 12 00:33:54 <nbags>	kk4ewt: i've looked in tweak tool
Oct 12 00:36:34 <nbags>	and a can't see an extension for this
Oct 12 00:43:18 <nbags>	ok, well here is the workaround: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1250

Oct 12 13:32:18 <yasumi2136>	i run on F30 LXDE with a laptop but my touchpad doesn't work for tap to click. I followed this page : https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_enable_touchpad_click#Other_window_managers , rebooted my system but still not working, any ideas?
Oct 12 13:33:26 <yasumi2136>	when i type echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE i get "x11" so i don't use Wayland
Oct 12 13:36:27 <diogenes_>	yasumi2136, afaik lxde is not developed anymore.
Oct 12 14:49:40 <Ilgaz>	I think kvirc crashed. I don't know if I could send my message or not. Here is the interesting thing. Fedora 30 is the only distro that can boot flawlessly on my HP Pavillion x360
Oct 12 14:50:01 <Ilgaz>	but fedora 31 freezes on boot, with only cursor appearing.
Oct 12 14:50:47 <Ilgaz>	I don't think a single byte of log etc produced as it is very early stage. I thought I better report this.
Oct 12 14:52:26 <Ilgaz>	I am downloading "rawhide" iso now. BTW, as you may guess, Live 31 beta ISO USB fails with same symptom too.
Oct 12 14:55:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Have you pressed "ESC" at the earliest Point, you can do that? You should see some errors, "behind"...
Oct 12 14:55:55 <Ilgaz>	No it is like nightmare for me and developers, nothing is written on screen or I would take a photo even
Oct 12 14:56:45 <Ilgaz>	Something in 30 stable makes it possible to boot, it doesn't exist on 31. Is the Kernel too different?
Oct 12 14:56:55 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: ouh, good luck!
Oct 12 14:56:56 <Khaytsus>	Kernel is different yes.
Oct 12 14:57:13 <whise_buddha>	I guess, Fedora 31 should use 5.3.5, am I right?
Oct 12 14:58:03 <Ilgaz>	Actually this is my 2nd Fedora install. I went frustrated with Broadcom 43142 not working so deleted it, reinstalled today so I can report things to developers&maintainers
Oct 12 14:58:59 <whise_buddha>	When it is you second install, dont use BETA.
Oct 12 14:59:08 <Ilgaz>	31, when working, at least initilized Broadcom 43142 without any networks visible. I was trying to re-create same setup.
Oct 12 14:59:10 <Khaytsus>	Ilgaz: where does it boot to?  You see grub?  Have you turned off rhgb and quiet?  maybe basic video?
Oct 12 14:59:16 <whise_buddha>	I guess the best way for you is to use STABLE
Oct 12 15:00:08 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: I am kinda used to pass parameters so yes, I removed hrgb and quiet, added verbose acpi=off
Oct 12 15:00:19 <Khaytsus>	and where does it boot to?
Oct 12 15:00:44 <Ilgaz>	Would adding vga=788 from Debian be a voodoo magic or would help anything on Intel HD 5500?
Oct 12 15:00:49 <Khaytsus>	no..
Oct 12 15:01:00 <Khaytsus>	that just sets the console mode, no point in that
Oct 12 15:01:37 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: Just a non blinking cursor with entire system frozen, external USB devices not powered back, caps lock led not working. Even CPU fan stopped
Oct 12 15:02:06 <Khaytsus>	so grub to blank screen and that's it?
Oct 12 15:02:25 <Ilgaz>	Yes. But Fedora 30 boots (the kernel from fedora 30)
Oct 12 15:02:56 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Is it an Option for you to install fedora 30 and then upgrade to fedora 31 BETA via dnf?
Oct 12 15:03:25 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I did exactly that. So, Fedora 30 kernel remains, 31 exists but doesn't boot
Oct 12 15:04:37 <Ilgaz>	I am particularly sad since fedora workstation is _the_ ideal distro for 2 in 1 laptop. It even figures the device concept change and shows virtual keyboard etc
Oct 12 15:05:19 <Ilgaz>	I will try the rawhide iso now. bbl
Oct 12 15:05:35 <whise_buddha>	Which Device is disfunctional in fedora for you, so that might be the reason for updating to Fedora 31?
Oct 12 15:06:14 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: broadcom 43142, a very particular hardware revision that is a nightmare to init
Oct 12 15:06:26 <whise_buddha>	is it wifi or bluetooth?
Oct 12 15:06:52 <Ilgaz>	a laptop without wireless is comical you know. Both wireless&bluetooth . I don't really care about bluetooth right now
Oct 12 15:07:38 <leden>	Ilgaz: did you install rpmfusion repos
Oct 12 15:07:41 <whise_buddha>	okay, so Fedora 30 can boot, but without wifi running, right?
Oct 12 15:07:41 <Ilgaz>	I even installed the dkms driver, didn't help. It was at least showing on 31
Oct 12 15:07:55 <Ilgaz>	ledeni: yes, I got the dkms one from them
Oct 12 15:08:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Did you see that: https://tanmaync.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/install-broadcom-bcm43142-wifi-drivers-fedora/
Oct 12 15:08:28 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: yes, it was my first attempt
Oct 12 15:08:41 <Ilgaz>	It makes perfect sense however, it doesn't work
Oct 12 15:09:03 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: sry, but I cant help you. :(
Oct 12 15:09:16 <whise_buddha>	good luck!
Oct 12 15:09:20 <Ilgaz>	The idea is reporting these things with proper lspci -vvv etc so people won't live the issues
Oct 12 15:10:04 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I am staring to an illuminated windows 10 dedicated key on this laptop, I mean this is like level 99 for Linux distros :-)
Oct 12 15:10:28 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: If it doenst work, think about to buy a USB-Stick with a supported wifi chip. It is very cheap, so.... ^^
Oct 12 15:11:26 <Ilgaz>	It seems like the only solution now, well, I keep reporting.
Oct 12 15:12:34 <Ilgaz>	BTW, in case anyone uses the official way to install broadcom from rpmfusion , there is a very interesting trick which is needed. You need to disable safeboot to modprobe wl
Oct 12 15:52:14 <f380cedric>	Hi, I'm trying to set my environment in wayland, but I cannot figure out why it's not working. I am setting my variables in .config/environment.d/99-defaults.conf. They don't appear in printenv nor systemctl --user show-environment. Any idea?

Oct 13 19:32:07 <malarivi>	I am trying to get prefix delegation handoff from my Fedora 30 Edge router to my internal 3750E switch. Has anyone done something like this? All I have running is nmcli with the eui64 address scheme
Oct 13 19:32:25 <malarivi>	I'm on ATT fiber with that horrible PACE router in passthru mode
Oct 13 19:44:44 <plarsen>	malarivi, I've tried with comcast but their instructions doesn't seem to work for IPv6 - no matter what I do for prefix deligation nothing seems to work.
Oct 13 19:45:00 <plarsen>	So if you find something that explains a methodology to follow please share :D
Oct 13 19:46:53 <plarsen>	Problem I have is that every IP in the prefix range is rejected by comcast ...
Oct 13 19:47:12 <malarivi>	I got it working using the 2001:DB8::1/64 with the radvd method but I want multicast working since we dont use RF cable anymore at home
Oct 13 19:48:17 <malarivi>	@plarsen what does your nmcli output look like for your wan interface? lets exchange notes? I see a /128, a /64 and a /60
Oct 13 19:49:48 <plarsen>	malarivi, ahhh, well I reset it all and this was done on CentOS6 when I struggled with it a few months ago.   I reverted everything to IPv4 only until I find a better option. I'll probably go the UniFi security gate route and leave my current CentOS box to be completely upgraded and reset, and just handle my internal lab stuff and not be the external edge router.
Oct 13 19:50:07 <plarsen>	Sorry - I wish I hadn't done that. I would love to have exchanged settings.
Oct 13 19:50:26 <plarsen>	CentOS6 != nmcli
Oct 13 19:50:42 <plarsen>	It's all the old network scripts.
Oct 13 19:51:34 <malarivi>	plarsen, check your channels for my msg. Should give some perspective
Oct 13 20:47:38 <first-order>	What if they replaced Fedora Branched with a rolling Fedora Stream implementation, and then had stable Fedora inbetween that and CentOS Stream?
Oct 13 20:58:09 <billings>	CentOS stream is just CentOS 8 with updates that will be in the next point release of CentOS
Oct 13 20:58:29 <billings>	if you want something like that, just turn on updates-testing
Oct 13 20:58:45 <billings>	or rawhide, I suppose, depending on your perspective
Oct 13 21:01:32 <Comnenus>	Has anyone gotten chrome-remote-desktop to work?  I have chrome and chromium installed, installed the chrome-remote-desktop package from repo, go to remotedesktop.google.com and install the extension.  Then it never prompts to enter the host information, I'm in a continuous loop  between remotedesktop.google.com and remotedesktop.google.com/access

Oct 18 15:53:28 <codebam>	ohhh I think I discovered the issue
Oct 18 15:53:29 <codebam>	so
Oct 18 15:53:36 <codebam>	I changed my username
Oct 18 15:53:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	whats the issue
Oct 18 15:53:48 <codebam>	and it seems to be looking in my old home folder
Oct 18 15:54:13 <codebam>	but I'm not exactly sure how to fix that. I could just create a folder and symlink it to my new home folder I guess
Oct 18 15:54:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	so everything works with a new user?
Oct 18 15:54:29 <codebam>	but there should be an option somewhere to remove that
Oct 18 15:54:49 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem I assume it would? considering the error I'm getting is just that it can't access the old images folder
Oct 18 15:55:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	so this is a PEBCAK
Oct 18 15:55:11 <codebam>	I haven't set up a new user yet
Oct 18 15:55:15 <codebam>	PEBCAK?

Oct 18 16:06:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	there will be a GO/NO-GO next thursday
Oct 18 16:06:52 <temple48>	goodness, feels like f30 was just a couple weeks ago
Oct 18 16:07:01 <coz_>	:)
Oct 18 16:07:22 <codebam>	where can I get signify on fedora?
Oct 18 16:07:42 <codebam>	why isn't it just in the official repos? isn't that like a standard package?
Oct 18 16:08:27 <Khaytsus>	temple48: Itw as.. for me ;)
Oct 18 16:08:43 <temple48>	Khaytsus: exactly
Oct 18 16:08:58 <Khaytsus>	Mostly because I hadn't had a spare round to it
Oct 18 16:09:03 <temple48>	got my last f29 machine up to f30 like a week ago, yeah
Oct 18 16:09:15 <temple48>	and now, kernel 5.3.6. amazing how quickly things move
Oct 18 16:30:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, because it isnt (not in fedora or rpmfusion
Oct 18 16:33:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, and when i google signify i am not finding anything that looks like FOSS
Oct 18 16:33:52 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem https://github.com/aperezdc/signify
Oct 18 16:34:17 <codebam>	although I don't know if that's the official version. it's an openbsd tool
Oct 18 16:34:28 <codebam>	it's just as FOSS as OpenSSH is
Oct 18 16:36:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, so why do you need it when rpms are signed
Oct 18 16:37:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	(it appears you love installing things from outside the distro so nm)
Oct 18 16:45:28 <idlemind>	codebam what do you have for: virsh -c qemu:///session pool-dumpxml gnome-boxes
Oct 18 16:47:44 <idlemind>	might just need to delete that storage pool (or move it and it edit the path of the storage pool). if you delete it and want it to be recreated you could try closing gnome-boxes and set the first-run flag on the app: gsettings set org.gnome.boxes first-run true

Nov 07 14:10:49 <RMPR>	Hello, is there any reason for fedora maintainers to not package apache netbeans ?
Nov 07 14:14:55 <RMPR>	More specifically, my problem is I installed netbeans 11.2 from flatphub and I wasn't satisfied because I couldn't change the jdk version
Nov 07 14:15:12 <Khaytsus>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/NetBeans is the documented, suggested method.
Nov 07 14:16:03 <billings>	The package was orphaned because the maintainer never treid to get it to build on Fedora 30
Nov 07 14:16:38 <billings>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1675447 is the BZ showing that the packager got ample notice
Nov 07 14:17:16 <billings>	although I think there was a discussion on fedora-devel about how the java package maintainers were just ignoring email from bugzilla because they got so much
Nov 07 14:17:57 <knstn>	"alternatives --list" could be messing you out
Nov 07 14:21:39 <RMPR>	Khaytsus: thanks, although I'm still wondering why it's not packaged
Nov 07 14:22:50 <RMPR>	knstn: yeah it's useful only when you don't use the flatpak, because it comes with his own jdk.
Nov 07 14:23:05 <RMPR>	and you can't change that.
Nov 07 14:24:02 <billings>	it isn't packaged because the package maintainer stopped maintaining it.  It was retired.
Nov 07 14:24:33 <billings>	Fedora is a community maintained linux distro
Nov 07 14:25:21 <RMPR>	billings: yh
Nov 07 14:26:07 <billings>	yh?
Nov 07 14:27:29 <RMPR>	for yeah
Nov 07 14:27:59 <billings>	ok.
Nov 07 14:28:10 <billings>	That's short for "Okay" in case you were wondering.

Nov 07 18:54:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	bbigby64, did you see if there was an eclipse from modular ?
Nov 07 18:54:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	or copr
Nov 07 19:35:21 <hjek>	Hi, on my Fedora installation here, in Gnome Software I have 3 apps that are stuck in that they are "pending" installation. They persist even when restarting Gnome Software or Fedora. I can't cancel them, and when clicking on the check mark button the cancel button is also grayed out. I wonder, how can I reset or clear the Gnome Software (or PackageKit..?) install queue?
Nov 07 19:36:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek,  so if they are persistant time to go to the commandline and see whats up
Nov 07 19:37:34 <hjek>	@Southern_Gentlem: dnf behaves fine. It's only really in Gnome Software this issue is there.
Nov 07 19:37:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	what are the apps
Nov 07 19:37:52 <domhnall>	sounds like you're low on swap
Nov 07 19:37:59 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: programs; pieces of softwage, e.g. Inkscape
Nov 07 19:38:04 <hjek>	Plenty of swap
Nov 07 19:38:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek, so flatpaks
Nov 07 19:38:35 <hjek>	domhnall: 1.5 GB swap free
Nov 07 19:39:10 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: Well, I'm not sure whether the ones that are stuck are flatpaks or not.
Nov 07 19:40:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	uname -r
Nov 07 19:40:14 <hjek>	5.3.8-200.fc30.x86_64
Nov 07 19:40:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	and what happens if you dnf install inkscape
Nov 07 19:42:25 <hjek>	So, it installs fine. But it's still listed as pending in Gnome Software, and every time I open Gnome Software I get this error popup that the app failed to install because it's "not compatible"...
Nov 07 19:42:33 <knstn>	I would also suggest "pkcon repair" && "pkcon refresh"
Nov 07 19:44:45 <hjek>	knstn: that fixed it. cool
Nov 07 19:45:51 <hjek>	ah, so that's the packagekit CLI..! interesting. didn't know about that one.
Nov 07 19:46:33 <hjek>	i'm not going to report this one as a bug unless I can figure out how to reproduce it. not sure how it happened.
Nov 07 19:47:05 <hjek>	knstn: No! They came back now, the apps, as "pending"!
Nov 07 19:49:37 <leden>	hjek,'killall gnome-software' &  'rm -rf ~/.cache/gnome-software'
Nov 07 19:52:27 <hjek>	leden: That's one of the first things I tried. I'll try it again, but the "pending" apps remain.
Nov 07 19:53:31 <hjek>	(Maybe I should just upgrade to f31 and see if the issue disappears...)
Nov 07 20:03:17 <leden>	hjek, what exactly apps are
Nov 07 20:04:19 <hjek>	leden: The apps that are stuck here are: calibre, Modem Manager GUI and Table (Inkscape extension)
Nov 07 20:47:00 <brejoc>	Hi folks! Quick question: You have a broken Salt package in Fedora 31 because python3-tornado is too new. Where can I report this?
Nov 07 20:48:46 <noln>	brejoc, "point of contact" at https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/salt
Nov 07 20:48:51 <noln>	brejoc, or channel #fedora-devel
Nov 07 20:49:24 <Khaytsus>	Or log a bug?
Nov 07 20:49:31 *	Khaytsus suggests brejoc try the following URL and let us know if it helps or they need more assistance: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsAndFeatureRequests
Nov 07 20:53:04 <brejoc>	noln: Thanks! Looks like it was already fixed in rawhide. At least the changelog says so.

Dec 08 18:27:07 <latenite>	Hi folks, why does 'dnf remove' remove sooooo many packages? https://paste.ofcode.org/vrDr6nUsHrjC6pzyTpFuNg
Dec 08 18:27:58 <Khaytsus>	Because all those require kf5-kcmutils and then cascades from there
Dec 08 18:29:04 <Khaytsus>	Remove the devel package if you want, but removing the other one will remove most KDE stuff.
Dec 08 18:32:53 <latenite>	Khaytsus, how do I remove a package without removing the stuff that depends on it?
Dec 08 18:33:07 <Khaytsus>	You do not; they depend on it.
Dec 08 18:33:13 <latenite>	Like when I want to reinstall, in case I broke files
Dec 08 18:33:16 <Khaytsus>	Why would you think you need to remove kf5-kcmutils
Dec 08 18:33:31 <Khaytsus>	Why would you have broken files?  What in the world are you doing?  And anyway, dnf has a reinstall option.
Dec 08 18:33:38 <latenite>	like when I removed files of the package
Dec 08 18:33:41 <Khaytsus>	But yeah, if that's a problem, rethink what you're doing.
Dec 08 21:16:30 <abdulocracy>	Hey, after a recent update I've had tearing issues in Firefox
Dec 08 21:17:06 <abdulocracy>	Intel UHD 620 graphics
Dec 08 21:17:28 <abdulocracy>	I run GNOME on Xorg
Dec 08 21:17:47 <abdulocracy>	Previously was fine, happened pretty recently with an update
Dec 08 21:18:23 <abdulocracy>	Any ideas?
Dec 08 21:18:23 <wl_>	an update of what? Firefox, mesa, the kernel?
Dec 08 21:18:46 <abdulocracy>	I don't know, I just do an upgrade once or twice a week
Dec 08 21:20:30 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Tearing on X11 is extremely common.
Dec 08 21:20:42 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: If you don't want tearing, maybe run GNOME on Wayland.
Dec 08 21:21:18 <abdulocracy>	Well I have a more major graphical issue with Wayland
Dec 08 21:21:22 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Every single system I've ever had for close to 2 decades now, has tearing.
Dec 08 21:21:38 <abdulocracy>	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1827
Dec 08 21:22:25 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I have to wonder if that is still the case with all of the updates.
Dec 08 21:23:17 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I'm definitely not claiming that GNOME on Wayland is perfect.
Dec 08 21:24:19 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: But generally speaking, Wayland was created to eliminate a lot of layers that are in X11... but GNOME requires accelerated 3D and that doesn't work so well on a wide range of chipsets.
Dec 08 21:27:07 <abdulocracy>	dowdle, just logged in to Wayland and the issue is definitely still there, no improvement
Dec 08 21:27:54 <abdulocracy>	The weird thing is with F30 it was entirely fine
Dec 08 21:28:14 <abdulocracy>	I used Wayland full time
Dec 08 21:28:55 <Acru>	Hey, whenever I try to report an error with the error reporting tool, I tells me that the retrace job failed, and the log shows that yum failed with the error `ERROR You need to update rpm to handle...`
Dec 08 21:29:00 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I guess differences with different kernel versions... with Fedora trying to follow upstream as much as possible.
Dec 08 21:30:37 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I wish I had a fix for you.  You can go back to Fedora 30 if that helps... although now of course F30 is on the same kernel is F31.
Dec 08 21:32:06 <tairikuookami>	Acru, can you paste the output of 'uname -a' ?
Dec 08 21:32:19 <Acru>	`Linux acr.len 5.3.14-300.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 2 15:41:35 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
Dec 08 21:34:19 <tairikuookami>	when did you last do a 'sudo dnf update' from the command line?
Dec 08 21:34:46 <Acru>	a few hours ago
Dec 08 21:35:54 <tairikuookami>	what's the application that is failing?  have you tried to just open a bugzilla report on it directly?
Dec 08 21:38:10 <Acru>	tairikuookami audacity, gnome-calendar, and fedora media writer
Dec 08 21:38:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami on the `Problem Report` bug?
Dec 08 21:39:34 <tairikuookami>	well, you could file bugzilla on audacity itself for having a problem in the first place.
Dec 08 21:41:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami But wouldnt be that the job of the problem reporting tool?
Dec 08 21:43:06 <tairikuookami>	you're using gnome.  the gnome bug reporting tool is garbage.  it's failing.  sure, if it actually *worked* you could expect it to file a bug on your behalf..  it's broken.  so it's up to you to file the bug report on the things that actually matter, which is more audacity and calendar and much less the bug-reporting-tool.
Dec 08 22:00:49 <Khaytsus>	the problem is not the 'gnome' bug reporting tool.  First off, it's not gnome. Second, yes, sometimes it wants to install a ton of debug stuff to get more data and it fails.  And yes, if you can reproduce the issue just log it manually.  Rather than it being automatic, with no context.
Dec 08 22:25:29 <Acru>	Khaytsus What should I do if I can not reproduce the fault?
Dec 08 22:33:17 <Khaytsus>	Acru: I suppose there's not much you can do.  If you know what might have caused it you could look for and log a bug but without some reproduction steps or notion of how to reproduce it, it'd be difficult for someone else to fix anything
Dec 08 22:33:40 <Acru>	Khaytsus ok, thank you
Dec 08 22:49:33 <cflag>	Greetings, I am attempting to update my grub.cfg and am receiving the error `/usr/sbin/grub2-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1.  Check your device.map.`, as well as `/dev/sdf: open failed: No medium found` which makes sense as there is no /dev/sdf on my system.
Dec 08 22:49:55 <cflag>	Checking /boot I do not seem to have a device.map file at all
Dec 08 22:50:24 <cflag>	There is no entry for /dev/sdf in my fstab
Dec 08 22:53:26 <cflag>	I only got these errors after upgrading to 31
Dec 08 23:10:36 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in the file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:17:19 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in this file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:18:29 <[R]>	we heard you the first time...
Dec 08 23:18:35 <oppiet30>	laughs

Dec 08 23:26:03 <CharlesIC>	hello, i have a new monitor and im wondering if the refresh rate is set low.  how do i see?
Dec 08 23:26:05 <CharlesIC>	in fedora 31
Dec 08 23:26:34 <CharlesIC>	resolution is 3840x2160 / 16:9
Dec 08 23:26:54 <[R]>	xrandr will tell you the refresh rate
Dec 08 23:27:55 <CharlesIC>	   3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:27:56 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:28:00 <CharlesIC>	so it is at 30
Dec 08 23:28:10 <CharlesIC>	   1920x1080     60.00    59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98    60.00
Dec 08 23:28:17 <CharlesIC>	does this mean that i need to change it to 1920/1080 to get 60?
Dec 08 23:28:31 <[R]>	yes
Dec 08 23:28:46 <CharlesIC>	but it says 4096x2160 ... 59.94
Dec 08 23:28:52 <CharlesIC>	does that mean i can get arouind 60 for that one?
Dec 08 23:28:56 <[R]>	maybe
Dec 08 23:28:58 <[R]>	try it and see
Dec 08 23:29:26 <CharlesIC>	so i changed it to 4096x2160 9:5
Dec 08 23:31:13 <CharlesIC>	but how do i verify my current refresh rate?  https://paste.centos.org/view/353c7be1
Dec 08 23:31:23 <CharlesIC>	im on 4096x2160 right now
Dec 08 23:32:51 <CharlesIC>	is it for sure 59.94?
Dec 08 23:32:56 <CharlesIC>	from that output?
Dec 08 23:35:14 <CharlesIC>	oh, it was set at 30
Dec 08 23:35:34 <CharlesIC>	how do i change it to a higher one?
Dec 08 23:35:47 <oppiet30>	read xrandr man page
Dec 08 23:36:05 <CharlesIC>	i mean there is not a gui?
Dec 08 23:37:49 <oppiet30>	All's I see is for resolution.
Dec 08 23:38:07 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 -r 59.94
Dec 08 23:38:16 <CharlesIC>	that doesn't seem to do anything
Dec 08 23:38:31 <CharlesIC>	 3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:38:36 <CharlesIC>	it is still staying at 30
Dec 08 23:40:15 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:40:16 <CharlesIC>	trying this
Dec 08 23:40:18 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 75
Dec 08 23:40:31 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 60
Dec 08 23:40:32 <CharlesIC>	ok the line i just did fixed it
Dec 08 23:40:45 <CharlesIC>	3840x2160     30.00 +  59.94*   50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:40:54 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:41:05 <CharlesIC>	so i guess i need to put this in my .xinitrc
Dec 08 23:41:08 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:41:17 <oppiet30>	You should have a file monitors.xml (~/.config/monitors.xml)
Dec 08 23:41:23 <CharlesIC>	oh, there is no .xinitrc. does fedora still use that?
Dec 08 23:41:39 <CharlesIC>	looking now
Dec 08 23:41:40 <oppiet30>	Edit that file.
Dec 08 23:42:11 <oppiet30>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/861416/changing-refresh-rate-for-specific-monitor
Dec 08 23:42:40 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:42:41 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:42:51 <CharlesIC>	so should i put 60 or 59.94, as xrandr shows that?
Dec 08 23:43:02 <oppiet30>	I don't know.
Dec 08 23:43:12 <CharlesIC>	ok, i changed monitors.xml
Dec 08 23:43:14 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:43:19 <CharlesIC>	it did make the screen way brighter
Dec 08 23:43:55 <oppiet30>	You can google the monitor and look for specs, to see what it will support.
Dec 08 23:44:12 <CharlesIC>	well its set at 59.94 now
Dec 08 23:44:15 <CharlesIC>	it should support 60
Dec 08 23:44:17 <CharlesIC>	big improvement
Dec 08 23:44:22 <oppiet30>	Right
Dec 08 23:44:39 <CharlesIC>	now i can only do standard or dynamic for picture mode
Dec 08 23:44:40 <CharlesIC>	hmm
Dec 08 23:44:43 <CharlesIC>	no longer natural and other stuff
Dec 08 23:44:55 <oppiet30>	:)
Dec 08 23:45:22 <oppiet30>	Are you using gnome?
Dec 08 23:45:26 <CharlesIC>	cinnamon
Dec 08 23:45:33 <oppiet30>	I haven't sed that oneyet
Dec 08 23:45:45 <CharlesIC>	im talking about on my monitor/tv
Dec 08 23:45:49 <CharlesIC>	it previously had 4 modes
Dec 08 23:45:52 <CharlesIC>	now it only has 2, after changing
Dec 08 23:45:59 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:46:19 <CharlesIC>	ok thanks for your help everyone

Jan 02 11:19:01 <GPolonkai>	hello
Jan 02 11:19:44 <GPolonkai>	i just started a system upgrade (initiated from GNOME Software) on Fedora 31, and it’s reeeeeally slow (it’s running for almost 2 hours now, and it’s still at 26%
Jan 02 11:20:11 <GPolonkai>	is there a way to see what’s happening if i don’t have a root password set (thus, i can’t login on tty2..6)
Jan 02 11:35:01 <GPolonkai>	i guess rebooting the machine is a pretty bad idea
Jan 02 11:42:23 <tswsl1989>	I wouldn't advise it. Is there still disk activity? If so then it's probably still running the upgrade, just taking its time.
Jan 02 11:51:09 <Cybertinus>	hello, I'm running Fedora 31 KDE Spin with the XFCE desktop (I switched DE at some point ;) ). I have the XFCE NetworkManager Applet running. But this doesn't support Wireguard VPN tunnels. NetworksManager itself does support it (I can access the tunnel via nmcli). Is there a valid alternative for the NetworkManager Applet for XFCE that does support WireGuard?
Jan 02 11:51:38 <diogenes_>	GPolonkai, while it's upgrading, write an usb stick with Fedora on it, in case something goes wrong, you can re-install.
Jan 02 11:55:55 <topyli>	GPolonkai: you can't login at a tty if you don't have a root password? that's strange. do we have some new tty philosophy on fedora now?
Jan 02 11:56:29 <topyli>	i can login just fine, i just checked
Jan 02 11:57:13 <topyli>	first time in ages i saw a tty by the way :)
Jan 02 12:04:53 <GPolonkai>	tswsl1989: i can’t hear the disk doing something (luckily it has a HDD in it, as it’s a notebook without an HDD activity LED)
Jan 02 12:05:06 <GPolonkai>	diogenese: i always have one with me, just in case :)
Jan 02 12:05:51 <GPolonkai>	topyli: if you press “reboot and install upgrades”, you can’t login as an unprivileged user while the upgrades are running
Jan 02 12:06:33 <topyli>	ah so it's just during an upgrade. right
Jan 02 12:17:54 <GPolonkai>	i decided to go brave and pressed Ctrl-Alt-Delete; now it’s booting up seemingly fine…
Jan 02 12:18:45 <kwizart>	just FYI, a new version of the fedy tool is available, if anyone wants to request improvements of fixes, see also : https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/fedy/
Jan 02 12:57:08 <irreleph4nt>	Hello. I'd like to paste a file to paste.centos.org and am using the corresponding API example given on the website
Jan 02 12:57:20 <irreleph4nt>	but all curl returns is "invalid API key"
Jan 02 12:57:27 <irreleph4nt>	Is the documentation outdated?
Jan 02 12:57:48 <irreleph4nt>	Here is what I tried: curl -d private=1 -d name=irreleph4nt --data-urlencode text@winbinddpipe.ausearch https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 13:02:31 <irreleph4nt>	Okay, having worked around not being able to paste from cli, on to my actual problem: upgrading from fc30 server to fc31 via dnf broke selinux in context of winbind / samba for me
Jan 02 13:02:39 <irreleph4nt>	the AVC messages can be seen here: https://paste.centos.org/view/74081d36
Jan 02 13:03:33 <irreleph4nt>	The issue boils down to selinux denying access to /run/samba/winbindd/pipe for every service under the moon, which in turn renders me unable to use samba AD users to, for example, log in via SSH
Jan 02 13:04:16 <irreleph4nt>	I could create custom policies for each and every service on the box but instead would like to know how to fix this the right way
Jan 02 13:05:14 <irreleph4nt>	The directory and file are labeled like this: https://paste.centos.org/view/75d71b84
Jan 02 13:06:11 <irreleph4nt>	I already tried restorecon -R on the directory which changes the folder and pipe file from a samba label to winbind_var_run_t which does not solve the issue, though
Jan 02 14:08:03 <[adw]>	Hi, has anybody succesfully installed and got to work Unifi-controller on fedora server?

Jan 02 17:21:27 <yates>	are there any known issues getting this iso to boot off of liveusb: F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso
Jan 02 17:21:43 <yates>	?
Jan 02 17:22:25 <yates>	i flashed it using "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M"
Jan 02 17:22:32 <yates>	where "X" is appropriate
Jan 02 17:31:54 <RayTracer>	yates: ensure that there is nothing mounted from the usb (maybe automatically) before running dd
Jan 02 17:35:10 <yates>	i'm using a 4GB usb drive. is that big enough?
Jan 02 17:37:24 <RayTracer>	yates: should be enough, the iso seems to be 1.8GB
Jan 02 17:40:35 <RayTracer>	yates: and, as you're not using eg. "oflag=direct", you should run "sync" before unplugging/resetting
Jan 02 17:41:23 <RayTracer>	yates: besides that, I'm not aware of general issues
Jan 02 17:43:34 <yates>	ok, thanks RayTracer
Jan 02 17:54:22 <kk4ewt>	yates yes i tested that iso on a usb and there was no issue
Jan 02 17:54:41 <kk4ewt>	using dd and livecd-iso-to-disk
Jan 02 17:54:58 <yates>	kk4ewt: thanks - that is a good datapoint
Jan 02 17:55:43 <kk4ewt>	"dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:52 <kk4ewt>	 "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:59 <yates>	i am wondering if my brand of usb is inferior. i tried several attempts of flashes on several machines, none worked
Jan 02 17:56:04 <kk4ewt>	is the command i used
Jan 02 17:56:18 <kk4ewt>	yes you can have bad media
Jan 02 17:56:30 <yates>	it would be multiple bad media
Jan 02 17:56:38 <kk4ewt>	i have seen something say its 4G and only be 256M
Jan 02 17:57:00 <yates>	i tried two+ different pieces of usb by same mfr
Jan 02 17:58:08 <Khaytsus>	If a dd is too big to a media, it'll fail.
Jan 02 17:58:22 <Khaytsus>	Someone probably hasn't checked a checksum or something.
Jan 02 17:58:24 <yates>	it was an el-cheapo 4G usb off amazon
Jan 02 17:58:29 <yates>	i checked
Jan 02 17:59:24 <kk4ewt>	goto walmart and get a good media
Jan 02 18:00:40 <yates>	ha !
Jan 02 18:06:27 <RayTracer>	maybe it's also time to ask how it fails.. like: does the machine boot from usb at all
Jan 02 18:30:54 <yates>	RayTracer: yes, it boots, but after a long time and many dracut timeout messages it throws me into dracut
Jan 02 18:31:18 <yates>	it boots "sorta"
Jan 02 18:35:08 <RayTracer>	yates: maybe a web search for the hardware model reveals some workaround like acpi=off
Jan 02 18:54:41 <yates>	works with an ubuntu live cd
Jan 02 18:55:30 <RayTracer>	ok, this makes it look like it's not that :)
Jan 02 19:01:36 <yates>	lol
Jan 02 19:06:31 <bugs_>	curious about yates computer type
Jan 02 19:06:54 <bugs_>	it sounds like a usb3 / usb2 issue
Jan 02 19:34:33 <razorfreak>	hello, can someone help me with brightness issue? the keys aren't working.
Jan 02 19:34:52 <sfranken>	F lock?
Jan 02 19:35:35 <razorfreak>	other keys are working except the brightness keys
Jan 02 19:36:11 <sfranken>	Is the key mapped to brightness in the settings?
Jan 02 19:36:48 <razorfreak>	when I press the key, brightness logo comes up
Jan 02 19:37:00 <razorfreak>	I think they are mapped
Jan 02 19:37:02 <sfranken>	That would be a "yes", then
Jan 02 19:37:16 <razorfreak>	I run F31, I tried this on F30 also
Jan 02 19:38:03 <razorfreak>	my laptop is DELL XPS 15 7590
Jan 02 19:39:06 <razorfreak>	xbacklight also doesn't work
Jan 02 19:40:28 <sfranken>	Let me check, I have the XPS 15 9560
Jan 02 19:41:31 <sfranken>	hmm, the keys work as expected on that machine
Jan 02 19:42:54 <razorfreak>	sfranken, so is there any way? I have been stuck trying to fix this for the last 3 days
Jan 02 19:43:52 <sfranken>	I don't know. Mine work out of the box...
Jan 02 19:44:30 <sfranken>	You could also adjust it from the menu at the top right, but that's more work
Jan 02 19:44:49 <razorfreak>	that is also not working
Jan 02 19:44:53 <razorfreak>	xrandr seems to be working
Jan 02 19:46:20 <sfranken>	hmm... What GPU is in your machine?
Jan 02 19:46:23 <sfranken>	And wayland or X11?
Jan 02 19:50:09 <razorfreak>	nvidia 1650
Jan 02 19:50:12 <razorfreak>	x11
Jan 02 19:50:38 <sfranken>	Does your laptop have an Intel GPU as well?
Jan 02 19:50:57 <razorfreak>	I think no
Jan 02 19:52:12 <razorfreak>	oh yes, intel uhd graphics 630
Jan 02 19:54:28 <sfranken>	Could you check what happens if you try the keys with the nvidia card blacklisted/disabled in the bios?
Jan 02 19:57:54 <razorfreak>	I am sorry, how do I do that?
Jan 02 20:00:43 <razorfreak>	I found something, I will check this https://nmilosev.svbtle.com/perfection-today-running-fedora-on-dell-xps-7590
Jan 02 20:01:12 <sfranken>	Reboot, and when you see the Dell logo press escape. That should get you into the bootmenu for Fedora (grub). Press E to edit and add "rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau nouveau.modeset=0" at the end of the linux....... line
Jan 02 20:01:57 <sfranken>	Ah, oled screen.. Those can't be changed the same way as other screens
Jan 02 20:03:09 <razorfreak>	so at least it should be handled right?
Jan 02 20:03:10 <sfranken>	(Becuase oled has no conventional backlight, which can't be brightned or dimmed)
Jan 02 20:04:16 <Khaytsus>	sfranken: Sure oled can be dimmed :P  But certainly maybe handled in a different way.
Jan 02 20:04:48 <sfranken>	Khaytsus: Yes it can be dimmed, just not in the conventional way by modifiying the backlight strength
Jan 02 20:05:11 <Khaytsus>	razorfreak: if you can pick a specific intel or nvidia device in the BIOS config, I'd just do that.  Optimus stuff is annoying.
Jan 02 20:13:27 <currybullen>	i've been having some trouble with a bluetooth headset and suspend, where my headset will not reconnect after resuming. i've noticed that it only happens when i do a hybrid suspend, both hibernate and ordinary suspend work fine. when the headset won't reconnect, the only thing that seems to help is a reboot followed by a manual reconnect
Jan 02 20:14:33 <currybullen>	is the bluetooth service not configured to resume after a hybrid suspend or something?
Jan 02 20:14:56 <sfranken>	Like I asked you before: what happens if you disconnect the BT and then reconnect?
Jan 02 20:15:20 <sfranken>	You probably, mostly, have a bluetooth card that doesn't get initialized right after your machines wakes up from suspend
Jan 02 20:16:52 <currybullen>	hmm, how would you like me to disconnect the BT? its integrated into my network card. switching it on and off with rfkill does not help
Jan 02 20:17:07 <sfranken>	From the gnome settings?
Jan 02 20:18:31 <currybullen>	i use cinnamon, which usses blueberry. disabling/enabling it there does nothing. i've also tried blueman with the same result
Jan 02 20:18:59 <shimsh>	chromium-libs-media-freeworld (updates) requires chromium-libs = 77.0.3865.90-2.fc30, but i can't find a matching version anywhere - dnf states the deps are broken too
Jan 02 20:19:07 <sdgathman>	sfranken: I have a similar problem with Intel wifi driver.  I have to remove/reload iwlmvm driver in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/iwlmvm.sh
Jan 02 20:19:11 <shimsh>	anyone else having this issue?
Jan 02 20:19:22 <sdgathman>	And also restart wpa_supplicant
Jan 02 20:20:13 <sdgathman>	Should this be reported as a kernel bug?  Or is the reinitialization supposed to happen in systemd?
Jan 02 20:20:21 <shimsh>	https://fedora.pkgs.org/30/rpmfusion-free-updates-x86_64/chromium-libs-media-freeworld-77.0.3865.90-2.fc30.x86_64.rpm.html
Jan 02 20:35:41 <kwizart>	shimsh, unfortunately chromium-libs-media-freeworld is unmaintained you need to move to chromium-freeworld
Jan 02 20:53:36 <shimsh>	thanks kwizart
Jan 02 20:58:02 <yates>	RayTracer et al: newsflash: the problem with my liveusb was my cheap thumbdrives
Jan 02 20:58:19 <yates>	i used my officemate's thumbdrive and it worked fine
Jan 02 20:58:37 <kk4ewt>	yates told ya
Jan 02 20:59:03 <yates>	...but i'm so glad i saved $10
Jan 02 20:59:23 <yates>	(that's a joke ^^^^^(
Jan 02 21:07:15 <sfranken>	"Yeah, but I save X amount because I buy cheap stuff" ... most people who say that don't realise their cheaper model doesn't last as long, so while I buy 3 expensive drives that last me years, they buy 10 in the same time
Jan 02 21:09:32 <tzfrs>	Hi guys. I broke my system. I added my ssd to fstab, but then wanted to make it work under windows as well so I formatted it to ntfs
Jan 02 21:10:04 <tzfrs>	Now I always get emergency mode where I can't do anything because the root account is locked and I have no live medium
Jan 02 21:10:27 <tzfrs>	Is there a way to boot into a bash without anything being loaded so I can edit the fstab?
Jan 02 21:11:22 <bugs_>	have you tried to boot in run level 1?
Jan 02 21:11:47 <bugs_>	edit the grub boot linux line and add 1 at the end, then boot
Jan 02 21:11:49 <tzfrs>	Do u just need to add a 1 to the end of the boot entry line?
Jan 02 21:11:51 <tzfrs>	Kk
Jan 02 21:12:14 <bugs_>	this is assuming things like the root volume isn't encrypted etc
Jan 02 21:12:21 <tzfrs>	It's not
Jan 02 21:12:45 <tzfrs>	Doesn't look good so far.
Jan 02 21:12:55 <sfranken>	tzrfs: Your SSD can't be found anymore, since the UUID has changed because you repartitioned / reformatted it...
Jan 02 21:13:35 <tzfrs>	Yes I know. But how can I remove the line from fstab?
Jan 02 21:13:40 <bugs_>	ok if the uuid in the grub entries has changed thats not going to work
Jan 02 21:13:55 <sfranken>	vim /etc/fstab tzfrs
Jan 02 21:14:08 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, I don't get any shell
Jan 02 21:14:39 <sfranken>	hmm, right... locked root account and all that
Jan 02 21:14:46 <tzfrs>	Yes
Jan 02 21:14:59 <kawazu>	Boot with the installer usb?
Jan 02 21:15:00 <sfranken>	Phyiscally remove the SSD (disconnect the SATA cable) and boot again
Jan 02 21:15:04 <sfranken>	brb
Jan 02 21:15:11 <tzfrs>	I only have a win USB stick.
Jan 02 21:15:15 <tzfrs>	Which doesn't seem to work.
Jan 02 21:15:35 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, does this really solve it? I mean the wrong entry would still be there wouldn't it?
Jan 02 21:15:56 <bugs_>	another boot option is init=/bin/bash
Jan 02 21:16:03 <bugs_>	but that assumes the grub configuration is ok
Jan 02 21:16:26 <tzfrs>	Where do I put that? Also where the 1 is at the end?
Jan 02 21:16:36 <bugs_>	yes replace the 1
Jan 02 21:16:47 <tzfrs>	K, one sec
Jan 02 21:16:55 <bugs_>	you would have to know how to navigate in an empty environment
Jan 02 21:16:58 <bugs_>	i.e. no path
Jan 02 21:17:45 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:20:08 <tzfrs>	Hm. Somehow I don't think it saved my changes.
Jan 02 21:20:32 <tzfrs>	What was the save and exit cmd for vim again?
Jan 02 21:20:54 <sfranken>	:wq
Jan 02 21:21:04 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:22:21 <sfranken>	But I thought you had "noauto" passed as a mounting option?
Jan 02 21:22:38 <sfranken>	Oh, wait, nvm
Jan 02 21:22:44 <tzfrs>	The file is readomly
Jan 02 21:22:46 *	sfranken is working on too much at the same time
Jan 02 21:22:48 <knaccc>	hey peeps, just wondering: normally fedora is not recommended in production i think because sudden changes may break things in packages. i was wondering if fedora would be suitable in production if you're not really using many packages, e.g. because you're mostly just running java on it with your own download and install of java. or are there other reasons that fedora in production is a bad idea?
Jan 02 21:23:00 <tzfrs>	Can I make it to 777 just for now and change it back again after fixing?
Jan 02 21:23:05 <bugs_>	mount -o remount,rw /
Jan 02 21:23:12 <sfranken>	tzfrs: Remount read-write
Jan 02 21:23:15 <sfranken>	thanks bugs_
Jan 02 21:23:37 <sfranken>	knaccc: Who says Fedora isn't recommended in production?
Jan 02 21:23:50 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:24:02 <sfranken>	(It really depends on your situation, though.. Our school works fine with our Fedora labs)
Jan 02 21:24:06 <knaccc>	sfranken i think most people would say to use centos over fedora in production, because each release of fedora only has 6 months of support
Jan 02 21:25:10 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:25:14 <tzfrs>	Thank you all!
Jan 02 21:25:38 <sfranken>	7 months knaccc. X + 1 where X is the version number. Yes, that's short. Like I said, it depends on what you use the machines for
Jan 02 21:25:57 <sfranken>	As I said: our Fedora lab at the school I work for runs fine. Has been running fine for 4 years now
Jan 02 21:26:04 <sfranken>	with upgrades from release to release
Jan 02 21:27:32 <knaccc>	what i'm scared of is that suddenly the new fedora comes out, and it makes changes that require a couple months of redevelopment of server mainteance and deployment scripts to adapt to, and during that period you aren't able to upgrade yet so miss out on critical security patches
Jan 02 21:28:24 <knaccc>	put it this way: are there huge advantages to being on the latest kernel that fedora has, in terms of better performance/concurrency, or in terms of security hardening?
Jan 02 21:29:09 <knaccc>	or does it not really make a difference whether i'm on kernel 5.3 vs 3.10
Jan 02 21:29:15 <sfranken>	That's why you have a few machines and servers running outside your normal network to test stuff on, right?
Jan 02 21:29:54 <sfranken>	But if you want mission critical and low changes: go centos. Again, depends on what you're going to use them for
Jan 02 21:30:01 <sfranken>	Can't really give you an answer withouth that info
Jan 02 21:30:13 <knaccc>	well yeah it's possible to do my own testing for performance improvements, but impossible for me to do my own testing for security hardening improvements
Jan 02 21:30:51 <knaccc>	for that i need some kind of commentary on what changed between 5.3 vs 3.10 in terms of security hardening
Jan 02 21:31:22 <sfranken>	Wouuldn't the changelogs provide you with that?
Jan 02 21:32:14 <knaccc>	sfranken yeah i'm wondering if anyone has an answer that is better than "go research it yourself"
Jan 02 21:33:31 <sfranken>	I'm not sure you're going to get what you want then..
Jan 02 21:33:41 <knaccc>	e,g, i don't really know how to reason about whether the new "kernel lockdown" changes are a big deal https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aefcf2f4b58155d27340ba5f9ddbe9513da8286d
Jan 02 21:33:49 <sfranken>	AFAIK the kernel release notes are your "goto source" for this kind of info
Jan 02 21:34:13 <knaccc>	yeah finding the release notes is one thing. interpreting the significance of them is an entirely different ball game
Jan 02 21:34:26 <knaccc>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions
Jan 02 21:34:40 <knaccc>	but it's gonna take me probably the whole day at least to try and delve into what all of these things mean
Jan 02 21:35:49 <sfranken>	hmm...
Jan 02 21:36:06 <sfranken>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
Jan 02 21:36:32 <sfranken>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
Jan 02 21:37:48 <knaccc>	ok thanks
Jan 02 21:40:26 <sfranken>	Same goes for CentOS though
Jan 02 21:41:14 <knaccc>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
Jan 02 21:41:37 <knaccc>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
Jan 02 21:42:19 <sfranken>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
Jan 02 21:42:25 <sfranken>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
Jan 02 21:42:59 <sfranken>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
Jan 02 21:43:17 <sfranken>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
Jan 02 21:43:38 <knaccc>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using
Jan 02 21:43:57 <sfranken>	And some driver backports
Jan 02 21:44:16 <sfranken>	Things like CPU support for new(er) Intel/AMD CPU's and stuff like that
Jan 02 21:44:37 <knaccc>	oh interesting, i didn't know about cpu support backports in centos, thanks!
Jan 02 21:45:03 <sfranken>	Not sure about CentOS 7.x though, I'm not running 7.x anymore
Jan 02 21:45:27 <knaccc>	i was told in #centos that centos 8 is currently a bit of a mess in terms of package support
Jan 02 21:45:39 <knaccc>	so to stick to centos 7.7 for now
Jan 02 21:45:41 <sfranken>	It's still rough around the edges, but for me it works
Jan 02 21:45:59 <sfranken>	For what I need CentOS 8 has better support than 7
Jan 02 21:46:07 <knaccc>	what are your needs?
Jan 02 21:46:08 <sfranken>	(Webserver with modern PHP requirements)
Jan 02 21:46:11 <knaccc>	ah ok
Jan 02 21:46:27 <knaccc>	did you hit any snags with centos 8?
Jan 02 21:46:43 <sfranken>	For the webservers I didn't
Jan 02 21:47:11 <sfranken>	for the Python lab we did. We were testing to see if we could move that over to CentOS 8 as well. But Python3 acted strangely with the teachers material
Jan 02 21:47:19 <sfranken>	so we kept Fedora 30 (31 now)
Jan 02 21:49:49 <knaccc>	interesting, thanks
Jan 02 21:51:33 <sfranken>	No problem
Jan 02 22:06:09 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: So you're saying that the CentOS kernel is slow..  the distro that holds the vast majority of servers in the world..  k
Jan 02 22:10:39 <kawazu>	Is the new Ryzen the way to go these days?
Jan 02 22:11:44 <knaccc>	Khaytsus i'm not saying it's slow, i'm wondering whether it is or not. if kernel 5.3 from 2019 is not much faster than kernel 3.10 from 2013, then fine
Jan 02 22:12:17 <prussian>	given RH's backportiness, it's basically impossible to make version upstream to upstream comparisons
Jan 02 22:12:34 <knaccc>	i'm wondering whether new io schedulers optimized for nvme and new thread schedulers will make a big difference or not
Jan 02 22:12:57 <prussian>	best guess is no and RH might just backported it anyhow.
Jan 02 22:13:33 <sfranken>	Only way to know for sure is test on your actual hardware
Jan 02 22:21:36 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: Again, probably _millions_ of servers use CentOS.  So..
Jan 02 22:23:18 <knaccc>	Khaytsus yeah thanks, it's a good point that does make me feel a little better
Jan 02 22:23:47 <knaccc>	it also makes me wonder why the kernel has not made significant enough performance increases in the last 6 years
Jan 02 22:24:02 <knaccc>	significant enough to warrant more people to upgrade
Jan 02 22:24:54 *	Khaytsus facepalms
Jan 02 22:24:54 <prussian>	probably because all the low hanging fruit has been had. also note all the hardware wiggling around certain class of hardware bugs
Jan 02 22:26:04 <prussian>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.
Jan 02 22:26:52 <knaccc>	interesting
Jan 02 22:27:01 <prussian>	I guess?
Jan 02 22:27:37 <prussian>	if you're currently using fedora, you're basically running the near tippy top of what kernel.org is shipping as stable. I'm surprised you haven't had any issues from that.
Jan 02 22:29:54 <yates>	how do you access root in f31 gnome ? i don't just want to sudo a command, i want to log in
Jan 02 22:30:29 <sfranken>	You don't
Jan 02 22:30:44 <sfranken>	You can however `sudo su -`
Jan 02 22:30:53 <yates>	i do
Jan 02 22:30:57 <yates>	and i will
Jan 02 22:31:20 <sfranken>	You could unlock the root account and set a password
Jan 02 22:31:40 <sfranken>	sudo passwd -u root && sudo passwd root
Jan 02 22:32:08 <sfranken>	But not *really* sure that's a sane idea and all, the root acount being scrambled is done for a reason I'm sure
Jan 02 22:37:15 <yates>	to piss people off
Jan 02 22:37:47 <prussian>	if you set your user up as an "administrator" it forgoes asking for a root password.
Jan 02 22:37:55 <prussian>	at least if you installed with anaconda
Jan 02 22:38:51 <sfranken>	Yeah because it's *so* much work to type sudo -i yates
Jan 02 22:39:02 <sfranken>	Sorry, I'm not getting your issue with root being scrambled
Jan 02 22:39:24 <prussian>	it shouldn't even have a password configured, other than an invalid hash "!!"
Jan 02 22:40:28 <yates>	you are free to operate your linux distro how you wish
Jan 02 22:41:06 <sfranken>	True, but why the issue then? Unlock the account and be happy about iut?
Jan 02 22:41:08 <sfranken>	*it
Jan 02 22:41:12 <prussian>	truly
Jan 02 22:41:31 <prussian>	I operate my fedora with all sorts of zany customizations
Jan 02 22:41:45 <prussian>	not sure how having to set up a root password impedes this.
Jan 02 22:42:14 <yates>	the issue is people who think they know how i should use a computer
Jan 02 22:42:22 <yates>	and i am
Jan 02 22:42:45 <prussian>	ight.
Jan 02 23:08:59 <janos_>	i have to agree - freedom of use being a core tenent and all
Jan 02 23:09:16 <janos_>	even if not considered a "best practice"
Jan 02 23:10:32 <sfranken>	Oh I totally agree, it's just that sometimes something is put in place for very good reasons. I hated root access being dropped or locked out, untill I read the reasoning behind it (not Fedora specific, this was in the Ubuntu days for me). After I read that I changed my opinion
Jan 02 23:12:24 <j^2>	i was trying to post something to paste.centos.org, and getting "invalid api key" kicked back, how can i request one?
Jan 02 23:13:05 <sfranken>	How are you trying to post it j^2?
Jan 02 23:13:08 <sfranken>	with fpaste?
Jan 02 23:13:18 <j^2>	curl -d text='this is my text' https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 23:13:23 <j^2>	from the example
Jan 02 23:13:39 <j^2>	i wanted to set up some bash foo to get some autoposting
Jan 02 23:16:10 <sfranken>	Can't you use fpaste in your bash foo then?
Jan 02 23:16:25 <j^2>	i haven't given the fpaste a shot tbh, let me try it out
Jan 02 23:18:26 <j^2>	sfranken, yep, fpaste worked fine. interesting that the direct curl to the API doesn't :-O
Jan 02 23:19:46 <RayTracer>	sudo -i
Jan 02 23:19:58 <j^2>	heh, there's a hard coded API key in fpaste: https://pagure.io/fpaste/blob/master/f/fpaste#_34
Jan 02 23:20:01 <janos_>	if you vi/vim fpaste you'll see why
Jan 02 23:22:05 <j^2>	sfranken, heh, well i can do the create now with curl...
Jan 02 23:22:34 <sfranken>	Is the text you're parsing not fpast'able?
Jan 02 23:23:22 <j^2>	oh no, i was just looking through the readme, saw the curl directly to API so figured i'd give it a shot. There was no place to say "request an API key" hence my poking and asking here
Jan 02 23:24:40 <janos_>	you might want to use fpaste in the script since it will be maintained - like if the api key changes or something else changes
Jan 02 23:25:07 <j^2>	janos, makes sense thank you
Jan 02 23:25:16 <janos_>	yw

Jan 22 11:45:18 <archuserau>	Hey all. Just installed Fedora on an MSI gaming laptop. The only issue is it can only see the nvidia gpu not the integrated intel gpu.
Jan 22 11:49:51 <kwizart>	archuserau, is it disabled in your bios/efi ?
Jan 22 11:51:34 <archuserau>	There is no option for it in my bios. I will check if there is an update
Jan 22 12:00:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: What do you mean by "only see" ? Is it because it only use the nvidia driver or is it because the Intel gpu don't show up in lspci ?
Jan 22 12:03:02 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is it present when you do lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)" ?
Jan 22 12:04:29 <archuserau>	It does not seem to show up in lspci
Jan 22 12:05:08 <archuserau>	Only the nvidia shows up with that command dfstorm
Jan 22 12:06:32 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is you computer a laptop or a desktop ?
Jan 22 12:06:43 <dfstorm>	your*
Jan 22 12:07:18 <archuserau>	Laptop.
Jan 22 12:07:41 <kwizart>	archuserau, which exact model do you have ? are you sure it's an optimus laptop ?
Jan 22 12:07:44 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Sorry.. I just saw you already said it
Jan 22 12:08:06 <archuserau>	kwizart: There is a gpu button that works in windows
Jan 22 12:08:12 <archuserau>	dfstorm: no worries.
Jan 22 12:09:16 <dfstorm>	archuserau: As root, is the directory "/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/" present ?
Jan 22 12:09:59 <archuserau>	dfstorm: Doesnt seem to be
Jan 22 12:10:03 <ossifrage>	I'm stuck running an old kernel (4.19.8) after my last reboot VirtualBox decided to stop working throwing a VERR_VM_DRIVER_VERSION_MISMATCH
Jan 22 12:10:04 <dfstorm>	archuserau: And are you using the laptop display or a pluged in display ?
Jan 22 12:10:16 <archuserau>	Using the laptop display.
Jan 22 12:10:25 <ossifrage>	I'm having trouble picking all the matched versions to get things to work again
Jan 22 12:11:14 <ossifrage>	I have the kmod-VirtualBox-4.19.8-300, but it seems that something else is wrong
Jan 22 12:12:31 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Well, you're having the same kind of laptop that I have; Optimus is not supported "natively". You're saying there is a "physical switch" to switch between nvidia and intel ?
Jan 22 12:12:57 <archuserau>	dfstorm: It is a button not a switch. In windows it work. In linux it doesnt.
Jan 22 12:13:06 <archuserau>	It is a MSI GT75vr
Jan 22 12:13:40 <archuserau>	What laptop do you have dfstorm ?
Jan 22 12:13:44 <ossifrage>	It was working fine before the reboot, I didn't think anything had changed and I had a vm running prior to reboot
Jan 22 12:13:59 <archuserau>	Give me a minute. I will boot into a different linux distro and see what happens.
Jan 22 12:14:50 <dfstorm>	archuserau: My guess is that by default your system will boot on nvidia.
Jan 22 12:15:10 <archuserau>	I am a little bit disapointed that I cannot turn the nvidia card off in the bios.
Jan 22 12:15:33 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Welcome to the "blackboxed" land of gaming laptop :(
Jan 22 12:15:52 <archuserau>	What do you mean blackboxed? What do you have?
Jan 22 12:16:00 <dfstorm>	archuserau:  I have a System76 Oryx 4
Jan 22 12:16:13 <archuserau>	Same issue?
Jan 22 12:17:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Me I need to get the "system76 power" utility ported to fedora to make my life easier. If not fedora is unusable (Nouveau don't work and is loaded by default.. just to say that)
Jan 22 12:18:23 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should look into other user with your hardware using linux. Often what work for one distribution will work for you too
Jan 22 12:18:37 <archuserau>	I will have a look
Jan 22 12:19:53 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Blackboxed = Manifacturer include stuff (like your button) without any documentation and they won't give away their source code. They just give a "windows specific" driver that won't work on linux...
Jan 22 12:20:43 <dfstorm>	Most of manufacturers*
Jan 22 12:22:51 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should try Archlinux if you know linux. Just boot the liveUSB then do the command I gave you
Jan 22 12:23:09 <dfstorm>	lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
Jan 22 12:24:06 <dfstorm>	And if your Intel card shows up, then you know it's a fedora automation that make the problem (even if it probably help in most of usercase)
Jan 22 12:35:17 <archuserau>	It looks like the issue is the hardware switch only works in windows. I just booted into windows pressed the button and i am now in linux with intel graphics

Jan 22 14:41:06 <CPrompt^>	good morning.  I have been getting a lot of segmentation faults when running dnf update lately.
Jan 22 14:41:33 <CPrompt^>	has anyone else seen this?  Looking through the bug tracker, I can't find a newer report
Jan 22 14:48:33 <Khaytsus>	CPrompt^: Look for other segfaults..  segfaults indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:49:06 <Khaytsus>	Could also be if you have a VPS or something that's VERY low spec and it literally runs out of ram, but that's generally not a segfault.
Jan 22 14:51:54 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: ah...I didn't realie that running dnf and it returning a segfault would indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:51:57 <CPrompt^>	Thanks!
Jan 22 15:00:07 <Khaytsus>	Segfaults can be sw but most often they are hw..
Jan 22 15:17:43 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: thanks.  I will look through some logs and see if I see anything.  I did see in "messages" that there might be an issue with an external drive.

Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	Hello all, I've just moved to Fedora from Ubuntu migrating my home directory from the former to my Fedora installation. It looks like Nautilus is in some ways still using the Yaru dark theme but I can't seem to find the file / setting to change it. As it is only the file preview pane is black (with black text) and the selection in the sidebar is black instead of Adwaita blue. Gnome software has similiarly weird dark
Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	color usages. I tried finding css files (nautilus.css, gtk.css) in my home dir that would create this problem but have had no luck. I've also tried changing and resetting the theme with Gnome Tweaks. Any further suggestions would be greatly appreciated
Jan 22 16:18:09 <prussian>	you might have to reset all your gconf settings.
Jan 22 16:18:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	chasinglogic[m], remove the files form your .config in your /home
Jan 22 16:18:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	control-h to view hidden folders
Jan 22 16:19:29 <prussian>	assuming you have checked the appropriate locations for theming and configuration, as pointed out above ^ ~/.config/gtk-3.0
Jan 22 16:25:16 <chasinglogic[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: Some deep dark file in .config was the problem, clearing nearly everything out of there worked
Jan 22 16:25:26 <chasinglogic[m]>	thanks both of you
Jan 22 16:28:34 <chasinglogic[m]>	Though it looks like Gnome Software still has the leftover dark theme in weird places
Jan 22 16:28:42 <chasinglogic[m]>	all of the tiles on the explore page
Jan 22 16:32:05 <chasinglogic[m]>	I am incorrect, logging out and back in fixed the gnome software issues as well
Jan 22 16:34:17 <prussian>	cool
Jan 22 16:34:19 <prussian>	good deal

Feb 19 14:24:50 <sohamg>	Hey im experiencing a bug(?) in F31 where i cannot lock the screen. The keyboard shortcut/panel button/timeout all result in the panel flashing which im assuming is a gnome shell crash. It used to trigger ARBT but now that i want to report it (im new to reporting etc) ARBT doesnt trigger. How would I get the logs/diagnostic info in this case?
Feb 19 14:26:31 <sohamg>	I think the 2nd to last update did this. Im on intel+nvidia/x11

Feb 28 21:58:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	lxde
Feb 28 21:58:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	i recommend no less than 50 for a Desktop environment
Feb 28 21:59:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	actually the smallest by live iso size is SOAS
Feb 28 22:02:32 <BlackMage>	50GB?!
Feb 28 22:02:51 <Khaytsus>	To use it as a normal daily system, yes
Feb 28 22:02:57 <Khaytsus>	For a random VM you
Feb 28 22:03:02 <Khaytsus>	you're not actively using, 20 is enough
Feb 28 22:14:13 <BlackMage>	only for building smaller programs, router firmware and trying out different things
Feb 28 22:14:57 <daniel-wtd>	BlackMage: it really depends on what you want to do. a minimal fedora installation with blackbox can be ~2GB disk space. Fedora Workstation recommends 20GB, which is sufficient for a small kiosk-like machine. If you want to have a ton of applications, photos, music, you have to count them in.
Feb 28 22:31:26 <BlackMage>	no, only a ton of libs required forbuilding
Feb 28 22:32:35 <BlackMage>	*for building
Feb 28 23:24:07 <BlackMage>	and lxde is the smallest gui?

Feb 29 15:53:55 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380 All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 16:12:51 <akik>	when installing a new kernel through dnf upgrade, the dkms stage takes too much cpu (the heat increases to the critical level) and crashes my laptop
Feb 29 16:13:00 <akik>	is there some way to limit that?
Feb 29 16:19:59 <Khaytsus>	akik: What is using dkms?  Most things on Fedora are akmod.  Plus....  how weak is your laptop that it can't compile a kernel module?
Feb 29 16:20:19 <akik>	Khaytsus: i have the wlan module installed through dkms
Feb 29 16:25:19 <avensurha>	akik: man cpupower-frequency-set
Feb 29 16:26:13 <fedbot>	*** F31-20200224 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2  Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins  ***
Feb 29 16:28:35 <akik>	avensurha: i need to install that. what do you mean by it?
Feb 29 16:29:14 <Khaytsus>	Maybe hit your fan with some pressurized air..  your laptop should never shut down because it's busy, especially not on a build which should take about 10s
Feb 29 16:34:10 <avensurha>	akik: you can limit your CPU frequency with it. it's part of kernel-tools package
Feb 29 16:35:06 <akik>	i'll try cpulimit as a first test if that'll work
Feb 29 16:35:26 <akik>	avensurha: do you mean changing the cpu governor?
Feb 29 16:35:58 <caterfxo>	akik: a google search returns suggestions like `cputool`, `cpulimit`
Feb 29 16:36:15 <avensurha>	akik: yes. and if i remember correctly, you can also set the max freq manually with it
Feb 29 16:41:26 <caterfxo>	possibly `renice`
Feb 29 16:46:36 <caterfxo>	`cool-retro-term`... probabably not so much
Feb 29 16:48:12 <Khaytsus>	I've never once had a machine that gets to any kind of 'critical temperature' doing anything.  that _screams_ something is wrong.
Feb 29 16:48:30 <Khaytsus>	Hot enough to throttle?  Perhaps, but not in the time it'd take to compile something small.
Feb 29 16:51:38 <akik>	Khaytsus: it's an old laptop. i have no high requirements for it
Feb 29 16:51:45 <ncuxo>	Hello I'm back ;D
Feb 29 16:51:58 <caterfxo>	me neither. maybe a stethescope would have revealed the laptop whispering, 'help me get hotter!'
Feb 29 16:52:29 <akik>	it run plasma 5 reqlly well though
Feb 29 16:52:34 <Khaytsus>	I'm guessing the fan is shot or clogged up.
Feb 29 16:52:44 <Khaytsus>	Hit it with some canned air, seriously
Feb 29 16:52:56 <ncuxo>	leden: I've reinstalled fedora and updated to 5.5.6 without an issue. I'm on 5.5.6 with the nvidia driver from the rpm fusion repo but there is a problem I have screen tear on my menu
Feb 29 16:53:35 <Khaytsus>	I had a laptop at work that kept getting jaggy on me, throttling.  I hit it with some canned air and it FILLED my office with dust.  I took it outside to hit it again, more plumes of dust.  No idea why it was so bad, office is not a dirty place.
Feb 29 16:53:41 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps because the laptop was eating it all
Feb 29 16:53:59 <Khaytsus>	After that no more jagginess..  it was actually able to keep cool
Feb 29 16:54:27 <ncuxo>	now I remember why I skipped this guide when I tryed to isntall nvidia before and moved to the nvidia xxx .run
Feb 29 16:54:51 <Khaytsus>	dnf install akmod-nvidia
Feb 29 16:54:52 <Khaytsus>	done
Feb 29 16:54:58 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: If you install the .run, you're on your own.
Feb 29 16:55:31 <short-bike>	Anyone else getting md5 mismatches on a DNF update - the 2 that dnf have failed on are 1) kernel-devel 5.5.6-201.fc31.x86_64.drpm and 2) selinux-policy-targeted-3.14.4-49.fc31.noarch.drpm: ? I have already run dnf clean all and re-tried the update. Same errors appear.
Feb 29 16:55:33 <ncuxo>	oh I couldn't upgrade from 5.4.19 thus I was recommended to reinstall :D
Feb 29 16:55:50 <jell48>	hi, im getting error from "curl https://google.com -v" in chrooted environment "* Unable to initialize NSS database"..."curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)", the db files exist in /etc/pki/nssdb/ directory. is there a way to find out which lib or component is missing?

Feb 29 16:56:35 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: very true. Will sleep the update for 30 mins. Thank you bud.
Feb 29 16:56:36 <avensurha>	Khaytsus: @nvidia .run
Feb 29 16:57:55 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: When I see that, it's typically short lived..  might go away on dnf clean all, may not.  Rarely have I seen it actually bug me beyond just trying to do an update, although I generally just dnf update nightly so I never do it manually
Feb 29 16:58:39 <akik>	ok cpulimit -i -l 50 worked. i see "make -j4" in the output
Feb 29 16:58:59 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: makes sense - but this is a fairly new install so updates are manually triggered ATM.
Feb 29 16:58:59 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: https://paste.centos.org/view/efeece9b
Feb 29 16:59:27 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: gotcha.  Yeah try clean all, if it fails, clean all again..  i think each time it'll generally wind up on a different mirror heh
Feb 29 16:59:37 <Uniaika>	hello
Feb 29 17:00:15 <Khaytsus>	libwebsockets has been failing me for a long time though, I just ran dnf update here for giggles to see if I was seeing any issues.
Feb 29 17:00:17 <Uniaika>	Since upgrading today, a couple of binaries on my system crash with the infamous "*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated"
Feb 29 17:00:35 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Updating how?
Feb 29 17:00:41 <Uniaika>	sudo dnf upgrade -y
Feb 29 17:00:43 <Uniaika>	nothing fancy
Feb 29 17:01:13 <Uniaika>	but the crashing binaries don't come from the Fedora repos.
Feb 29 17:01:22 <Khaytsus>	k...
Feb 29 17:01:29 <Khaytsus>	So...  they're broken?
Feb 29 17:01:33 <Uniaika>	(more precisely, they are `nix` utilities and the haskell `stack` tool)
Feb 29 17:01:55 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: up until yesterday everything worked perfectly
Feb 29 17:02:05 <Uniaika>	has there been any ABI change as of recently?
Feb 29 17:02:21 <Uniaika>	I am not a C programmer, so I have no bloody idea about the root cause of all this
Feb 29 17:03:29 <short-bike>	Uniaika: point release update of version upgrade (ie 30 -> 31 etc) ?
Feb 29 17:03:41 <short-bike>	s/of/or*
Feb 29 17:03:47 <Khaytsus>	Sounds like he just did a normal package update, not a distro update
Feb 29 17:03:51 <Uniaika>	nope, still running 30
Feb 29 17:04:04 <Khaytsus>	30lyfe..  I really need to udpate myself
Feb 29 17:04:14 <Khaytsus>	51 days, 21 hours, 55 minutes, 46 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Feb 29 17:04:46 <Uniaika>	should I maybe upgrade to 31?
Feb 29 17:04:58 <Khaytsus>	I doubt that'd fix your specific issue
Feb 29 17:05:20 <Uniaika>	I'm going to reinstall them manually
Feb 29 17:05:22 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: No idea about haskell, I know Fedora ships it, but I assume not the 'stack' util you mentioned?
Feb 29 17:05:28 <short-bike>	Uniaika: can we se either sysinfo or dnf repolist on a paste first please.
Feb 29 17:06:27 <Uniaika>	short-bike: of course, I'm getting you that
Feb 29 17:09:26 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: I already have this package installed and I still have the screen tear so I don't think the problem comes from there
Feb 29 17:10:24 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: I see minor screen tears here sometimes too, not like it's a big deal
Feb 29 17:11:10 <Uniaika>	short-bike: when you mean "sysinfo", is there a specific packet that provides that command?
Feb 29 17:11:28 <Uniaika>	anyway, here is my repolist https://hastebin.com/zotawutebe.coffeescript
Feb 29 17:11:56 <leden>	ncuxo, can you give us  ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ | fpaste
Feb 29 17:12:11 <short-bike>	Uniaika: fpaste --sysinfo (will generate a URL for posting in here) :)
Feb 29 17:14:23 <Uniaika>	short-bike: here it is! https://paste.centos.org/view/587f7d69
Feb 29 17:14:38 <ncuxo>	leden: https://paste.centos.org/view/efc3656d https://paste.centos.org/view/39e54984
Feb 29 17:14:51 <ncuxo>	first is the dir and the second is the content of the file
Feb 29 17:15:20 <short-bike>	Uniaika: my rationale for that is to see if there are any repo's in there that need to be disabled prior to you going to f31. But I can see from your first paste that there are.
Feb 29 17:15:30 *	short-bike looks at sysinfo 
Feb 29 17:16:22 <Uniaika>	(fun fact, reinstalling `stack` made it work again)
Feb 29 17:16:53 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Perhaps it got an update?  No idea.
Feb 29 17:18:41 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: I tried to update it from its own updater, and it told me I was already at the latest version :/
Feb 29 17:25:05 <ncuxo>	leden: should I have more files there ?
Feb 29 17:26:00 <leden>	ncuxo, can you make  like 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf and cat paste --> https://paste.centos.org/view/51d1d8af
Feb 29 17:26:50 <leden>	ncuxo, save it and reboot system
Feb 29 17:27:05 <akik>	Khaytsus: the idle temperature on this laptop is about 49 C. the critical temperature which was reached was 88 C :P
Feb 29 17:27:49 <akik>	i'll try that air cleaning some day soon
Feb 29 17:38:45 <ncuxo>	leden: I still have the screen tear
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 17:48:27 <ncuxo>	5.5.6 is out so its not up to date
Feb 29 17:54:54 <leden>	ncuxo, can you run 'nvidia-settings' in terminal
Feb 29 17:56:28 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b1d7d1e8
Feb 29 17:56:44 <ncuxo>	leden: I did run it but the nvidia driver is not loaded
Feb 29 17:57:02 <ncuxo>	I guess by default the nouveau driver is loaded
Feb 29 17:57:19 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:19 <ncuxo>	should I blacklist it?
Feb 29 17:57:24 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:29 <kwizart>	leden, NO!
Feb 29 17:57:50 <leden>	kwizart, ol
Feb 29 17:57:50 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you should follow guides: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Feb 29 17:58:05 <ncuxo>	kwizart: this is what I did
Feb 29 17:58:19 <ncuxo>	I started with another guide and leden gave me this one
Feb 29 17:58:32 <ncuxo>	so I reinstalled fedora and used the rpmfusion one
Feb 29 17:58:49 <kwizart>	ncuxo, please verify to have kernel-devel matching your kernel and let it build the nvidia kmod
Feb 29 17:59:24 <kwizart>	ncuxo, if you have nouveau still loaded, please don't manually blacklist it, please reboot a second time eventually
Feb 29 17:59:33 <kwizart>	ncuxo, and verify to have secure boot disabled
Feb 29 18:00:26 <ncuxo>	kwizart: isn't secure boot only on EFI?
Feb 29 18:00:37 <kwizart>	yes, it is
Feb 29 18:00:59 <ncuxo>	kwizart: I just rebooted and still nouveau is loaded
Feb 29 18:01:20 <ncuxo>	the kernel-devel and the kernel are the same version
Feb 29 18:01:23 <kwizart>	ncuxo, then paste the archive created by nvidia-bug-report.sh
Feb 29 18:01:42 <kwizart>	ncuxo, does modinfo nvidia output something ?
Feb 29 18:01:45 <ncuxo>	where is this located ?
Feb 29 18:01:56 <kwizart>	ncuxo, in your PATH
Feb 29 18:02:02 <ncuxo>	yes module nvidia not found
Feb 29 18:02:13 <kwizart>	ncuxo, try with akmods --force
Feb 29 18:03:12 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/0c748833
Feb 29 18:03:21 <ncuxo>	here is the nvidia bug report
Feb 29 18:03:55 <kwizart>	ncuxo, not really, zcat nvidia-bug-report.log.gz |fpaste
Feb 29 18:04:36 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/2a1cc05d
Feb 29 18:06:23 <ncuxo>	this is for akmods --force https://paste.centos.org/view/1ce39375
Feb 29 18:06:28 <ncuxo>	it was unable to build
Feb 29 18:07:58 <kwizart>	ncuxo, why are you using nvidia-390 driver ?
Feb 29 18:08:57 <ncuxo>	because this is what my card needs
Feb 29 18:09:28 <kwizart>	ncuxo, well, indeed, this is the right ones
Feb 29 18:09:32 <ncuxo>	its a legacy GeForce 400 card
Feb 29 18:09:59 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b33e60bd this is the akmods --force logs
Feb 29 18:10:02 <kwizart>	ncuxo, so we end-up having issue with 5.5.x kernel apparently and we are seeking for maintainers
Feb 29 18:10:36 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you might have better luck with the kernel-longterm-5.4 that I'm building
Feb 29 18:10:44 <kwizart>	ncuxo, https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/kernel-longterm-5.4/
Feb 29 18:11:14 <ncuxo>	oh with 5.4 I was fine
Feb 29 18:11:24 <ncuxo>	I was using it before I started to move to 5.5

Feb 29 22:06:24 <janos_>	oh hadn't seen that one. looking

Mar 02 12:40:31 <BlackMage>	is no partition manager in lxde-live included?
Mar 02 12:45:00 <p3lim>	Hey, is there something like du that lets me check disk space per directory, but on a specific disk? du shows directory space usage on all disks
Mar 02 12:46:26 <rru04>	du shows space usage of directories
Mar 02 12:46:50 <BlackMage>	specify the directory as argument
Mar 02 12:47:15 <FranciscoD>	BlackMage: you can install stuff on the live image, including a partition manager.
Mar 02 12:47:30 <FranciscoD>	Otherwise, when you want to install from the live, anaconda includes one
Mar 02 12:47:36 <p3lim>	I have 20 disks in the system, but the sysroot disk  is close to full, need to find out _on that disk_ what's taking up space, but it's showing disk space from _all 20 disks_
Mar 02 12:48:04 <p3lim>	specifying the directory doesn't help
Mar 02 12:48:08 <FranciscoD>	p3lim: `du <path to where whatever disk is mounted>`
Mar 02 12:48:19 <FranciscoD>	are you running it in /?
Mar 02 12:48:25 <p3lim>	yes
Mar 02 12:48:42 <FranciscoD>	`du <path>` works just fine here
Mar 02 12:48:47 <FranciscoD>	that's also what the man page says
Mar 02 12:48:48 <rru04>	p3lim: like that du -sh /usr/local
Mar 02 12:48:54 <FranciscoD>	where is the sysroot mounted?
Mar 02 12:49:01 <p3lim>	on /
Mar 02 12:49:22 <FranciscoD>	so then it's showing you the right output
Mar 02 12:49:33 <FranciscoD>	du does not do disks, it does folders/directories
Mar 02 12:49:50 <FranciscoD>	since all your disks are also mounted in /, it also looks at them
Mar 02 12:50:07 <FranciscoD>	manually specify what directories you want it to look at
Mar 02 12:50:14 <p3lim>	which is why I'm asking for something _like_ du but that takes disks into account
Mar 02 12:50:37 <FranciscoD>	not heard of anything that does that, sorry
Mar 02 12:51:04 <FranciscoD>	either you get disk overviews with df
Mar 02 12:51:11 <FranciscoD>	or you get directory data with du
Mar 02 12:51:34 <FranciscoD>	check their man pages, maybe they have advanced options
Mar 02 12:52:50 <rru04>	well df checks filesystems usage and on which device (disk)
Mar 02 12:54:28 <rru04>	as you know which filesystem is running out of space you will identify which directory contains too much of data
Mar 02 12:57:21 <BlackMage>	ok, after i resized the pv with kparititionmanager the system dont boot
Mar 02 12:57:22 <cberg>	p3lim: du -hcx -d 1 /
Mar 02 12:57:31 <cberg>	-x means don't traverse filesystems
Mar 02 12:58:47 <p3lim>	cberg: thanks!
Mar 02 12:58:49 <cberg>	and to sort it: du -hcx -d 1 / | sort -h
Mar 02 12:58:57 <rru04>	p3lim: find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -I REPL bash -c "du -s 'REPL'" | sort -g
Mar 02 12:59:47 <rru04>	with this command you will find how much data is in every directory and also it will sort them
Mar 02 13:00:38 <damo22>	or just use ncdu
Mar 02 14:55:06 <rexwin>	I donot want graphics in fedora . how to change the default runlevel to 3?
Mar 02 14:56:01 <der_Alte>	you can't because there are no runlevels anymore ... however you can set multi-user.target to be the default systemd target
Mar 02 14:56:10 <Khaytsus>	systemctl set-default multi-user.target
Mar 02 14:56:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	rexwin take a look at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SysVinit_to_Systemd_Cheatsheet

Mar 02 16:09:45 <FixPleaseTo>	I suffer, because Netflix doesn't play.  is somebody helping with this?  the service error code today is M7355. I'm running the l8est fedora with proprietary nvidia drivers to use chromium.  I have rpm fusion free and nonfree enabled
Mar 02 16:11:24 <linuxmodder>	iirc that is flash player related but should be minimal issue if at all on chrom*   it's more pronounced on firefox
Mar 02 16:14:32 <Khaytsus>	Netflix works perfectly fine on Chrome.
Mar 02 16:15:29 <FixPleaseTo>	my heart says go with chromium, buuuut it seems that it's going to be an option that's closed
Mar 02 16:16:00 <FixPleaseTo>	there is some "freeworld" flavor of chromium listed as well, but that only gives a partial functionality (previews play, but an actual show stream won't).  it also knocks the version (of chromium) down 2 numbers, and seemingly introduces a scary red icon on top relating to "sync", which I don't think I'll be using anyway
Mar 02 16:20:02 <karroffel>	Netflix works fine for me on Firefox
Mar 02 16:20:32 <karroffel>	You need to enable the DRM feature, but that was all that I had to do
Mar 02 16:22:24 <janos_>	fine here with firefox. never tried it before. just did, no problem
Mar 02 16:25:58 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, chromium-freeworld (or even fedora chromium) isn't allowed to distribute the DRM components netflix relies on
Mar 02 16:26:04 <storrgie>	I'm wondering if anyone has gone through the dnf update process (between say 30->31) with ZFS on their system (not ZFS root, but having attached ZFS pools)
Mar 02 16:26:16 <storrgie>	I'm thinking of moving from debian to fedora server and this is my one worry
Mar 02 16:26:29 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-chromium-or-google-chrome-browsers/
Mar 02 16:27:07 <FixPleaseTo>	ty lots, it's tgreat having options. thanks! this is bound to set me up now

Mar 18 14:09:57 <ufo>	so i want to uninstall geoclue2, and it looks like webkit2gtk3 depends on it for some reason
Mar 18 14:10:21 <Khaytsus>	Why would you need to remove it?
Mar 18 14:10:36 <ufo>	which looks like is on my system because of "yelp" browser, which i don't use...  but when i try to uninstall that it says anaconda depends on it
Mar 18 14:10:58 <ufo>	i don't want geo stuff at all
Mar 18 14:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	so why did you install the yelp browser
Mar 18 14:11:24 <ufo>	i didn't
Mar 18 14:11:45 <Khaytsus>	yhelp is gnome's help browser.. it's not a 'web' browser
Mar 18 14:11:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes you did yelp.x86_64 : Help browser for the GNOME desktop
Mar 18 14:11:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	ou installed gnome
Mar 18 14:12:02 <ufo>	i'm not sure why it would have been installed by default in the xfce spin
Mar 18 14:12:08 <Khaytsus>	I did not install Gnome; yelp is installed here
Mar 18 14:12:32 <Khaytsus>	I suspect it's bundled into some of the gnome stuff that is in every spin
Mar 18 14:12:55 <Khaytsus>	ufo: Obessing over individual packages is an interesting hobby but unlikely a productive one.
Mar 18 14:13:55 <ufo>	thanks

Mar 18 15:58:39 <Khaytsus>	God I hate matrix.
Mar 18 16:15:28 <Bayesian_Coffee>	having trouble with the internal mic on F31, on a ThinkPad T490. found this bug and comment: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772498#c223
Mar 18 16:15:47 <Bayesian_Coffee>	how do i get this pulseaudio-13.99.1-1.fc31.x86_64 package though?
Mar 18 16:15:56 <Bayesian_Coffee>	when i try to upgrade, i'm not seeing it in any repos i have
Mar 18 16:22:37 <kwizart>	Bayesian_Coffee, dnf update --enablerepo=updates-testing pulseaudio\*
Mar 18 16:24:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	ah, got it. will try that, thanks
Mar 18 16:31:30 <Bayesian_Coffee>	thanks! that worked perfectly
Mar 18 16:32:06 <Bayesian_Coffee>	so, newbie q: given that they closed that bug and filed a new one for F32, what do the update schedules look like for F31 from now on? is stuff not going to get patched in 31?
Mar 18 16:32:37 <Bayesian_Coffee>	like is that newer version of pulseaudio not going go make it into F31 outside of the testing repo?
Mar 18 16:34:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	Bayesian_Coffee, it looks like it is set tonight or tomorrow morning https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=pulseaudio
Mar 18 16:34:23 <Bayesian_Coffee>	oh, cool.
Mar 18 16:34:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	of course right when i start to WFH from COVID-19, to get on a Google Hangout my mic is out...
Mar 18 16:35:11 <Bayesian_Coffee>	but yeah, working perfectly now
Mar 18 16:44:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, https://imagebin.ca/v/5G3PKDX5bVc7
Mar 18 16:54:31 <idlemind>	so something recent has definitely sped up my vp9 encoding, that's a welcome change. went from ~ 24 h for a 480p full length movie to 5 h. nice
Mar 18 16:59:09 <nerdwoman>	Hey everybody, running fedora with xfce on my laptop here. Had to start doing video chatting for work and using hte camera at all uses 200%+ of the cpu, sitting around a load of 8 with 4 cores. I don't suppose there might be better drivers out there, that would help with this?
Mar 18 17:00:04 <nerdwoman>	... I've never troubleshot a webcam before, just audio drivers back in the day
Mar 18 17:02:01 <sbroz>	is it unexpected that realtime video encoding uses a lot of cpu?
Mar 18 17:02:39 <idlemind>	it shouldn't kill the cpu though, how is your performance with something like cheese
Mar 18 17:02:49 <idlemind>	might just be codec related
Mar 18 17:03:18 <idlemind>	(xfce likely won't have cheese, it has a flatpak though if you don't want to pull in a lot of rpms)
Mar 18 17:03:36 <dowdle>	idlemind: If you think that is slow, you should try av1 encoding. :)  It is measured in minutes per frame.
Mar 18 17:04:11 <idlemind>	dowdle ya for me a faster encode is kind of just a nice to have, i don't really have any deadlines. just slowly digitizing dvds
Mar 18 17:04:18 <dowdle>	idlemind: I tried encoding a movie and it was halfway done after about 2.5 weeks. :)
Mar 18 17:04:20 <idlemind>	just impressed in a 24 hr to 5 hr drop
Mar 18 17:04:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	sbroz, no its not unexpected
Mar 18 17:04:54 <sbroz>	Southern_Gentlem: indeed
Mar 18 17:05:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	idlemind, but to me i rather use the cheese in the repos than flatpak
Mar 18 17:06:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	it will definitely makes upgrades down the road easier with the repo packages
Mar 18 17:09:04 <ForlornWongraven>	flatpak is really nice to check something
Mar 18 17:09:13 <ForlornWongraven>	over time repos are much better
Mar 18 17:11:26 <idlemind>	ya, it's also nice from a dev perspective to hit a wide target without a lot of effort

Mar 18 22:40:04 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: since the source code is available I may think of starting packaging it
Mar 18 22:40:12 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see this for EL7 - https://github.com/Rupan/mprime
Mar 18 22:41:51 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: very interesting
Mar 18 22:42:02 <Caterpillar>	I wonder why this guy never putted those specs in fedora repo
Mar 18 22:42:08 <Caterpillar>	and / EPEL
Mar 18 22:43:29 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Well, while the source code is available they have quite a few licensing terms... and a skim of those makes it appear they claim to own all data... so maybe it isn't free software?!?
Mar 18 22:45:30 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: maybe, I had not seen the license yet
Mar 18 22:46:28 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see quite a few web references to use mprime as a system stress test... and every reference I've seen refers to the links provided by the software provider's website and not any packages from distros.
Mar 18 22:47:21 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Doesn't look like Debian packages it.
Mar 18 22:50:14 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: yes, the license page is a bit........wird

Mar 19 10:54:36 <andy|>	anyone else on f32 having problems with sound output and bluetooth headset?
Mar 19 11:31:51 <bern>	hi, I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 11:51:33 <BinaryAura>	I'm trying to install Nvidia drivers but after I disabled nouveau my monitors no longer are receiving input and my motherboard is not giving any signs of error. Any advice?
Mar 19 11:53:33 <kwizart>	BinaryAura, you shoudn't touch any low level driver, but rely on using packaged driver as this is way easier even for advanced users
Mar 19 11:54:11 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: rpmfusion has the nvidia driver packaged for Fedora. You only need to install the packages and that's it, it  takes care of the rest including disabling nouveau.
Mar 19 11:56:27 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:42 <ratskin>	BinaryAura: RPMFusion's HowTo includes instructions for recovering from any mess that might be left by using Nvidia's installer: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:50 <ratskin>	Snap :)
Mar 19 11:56:55 <[Enrico]>	as easy as it can get with Nvidia on Linux
Mar 19 11:57:11 <[Enrico]>	still definitely not as easy as with Intel and AMD
Mar 19 11:57:48 <BinaryAura>	I had two GPU cards installed I switched which one I was using and the monitor came up. This is weird because both cards were working before

Mar 19 14:21:28 <Sheogorath[m]>	oDiafanos: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-apache-http-server/ <-- this should get your through the basics :)
Mar 19 14:30:24 <oDiafanos>	thanks but this site doesnt include vhost multiple site configuration
Mar 19 14:31:52 <Khaytsus>	oDiafanos: #httpd
Mar 19 14:32:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  google does
Mar 19 14:32:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	basicly you can do one you can do many
Mar 19 14:32:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	(Directory) (/Directory)
Mar 19 14:33:23 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: What do you need to know?
Mar 19 14:34:32 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if I make an index file in /var/www/html everything works (no welcome page)
Mar 19 14:35:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Mar 19 14:35:19 <vdamewood>	That's normal.
Mar 19 14:35:24 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if i make a "Second site" in /var/www/html/docs/index with the appropriate "vhost" file
Mar 19 14:35:41 <vdamewood>	What's a "vhost" file?
Mar 19 14:36:08 <oDiafanos>	a conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d
Mar 19 14:38:06 <oDiafanos>	to send my browser request throught a test domain to a specific httpd folder
Mar 19 14:38:06 <vdamewood>	I se an "if", but no follow up "then"
Mar 19 14:38:09 <vdamewood>	s/se/see/
Mar 19 14:39:56 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: ? :P
Mar 19 14:40:36 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, it's rather impossible to figure out what's going on until you complete your thought.
Mar 19 14:41:09 <oDiafanos>	ok so : index file in /www/html folder works normaly
Mar 19 14:42:03 <oDiafanos>	second index in /www/html/docs/index WITH conf file with test domain dont work
Mar 19 14:42:41 <oDiafanos>	in second example welcome page appears in all test domains
Mar 19 14:45:05 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: 1: You should probably put web spaces in different directories, and not have one as a child of the other. 2: What's the name of your conf file with the virtual host information? 3: fpaste your vhost config file.
Mar 19 14:45:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos, <Directory /www/html/test>   </Directory>
Mar 19 14:47:07 <vdamewood>	Oh, I just noticed it's /www and not /var/www. So, yeah <Directory ...>, but also, did you do either of changing the selinux context on the /www directory, or disable selinux?
Mar 19 14:50:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	vdamewood, also depends on their document root statement above that
Mar 19 14:50:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	mine says /srv/www/html
Mar 19 14:51:23 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: it all in  /var/www/html , i just skipped writing /var but its correct in my configuration
Mar 19 14:51:45 <vdamewood>	I think my production system doesn't even have a Document Root outside of a vhost.
Mar 19 14:52:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  so make a subdirectory for each host under that
Mar 19 14:53:59 <oDiafanos>	Southern_Gentlem: i'll try that now + <Directory ...>  + disable se
Mar 19 14:56:03 <vdamewood>	Actually, if you're in /var/www, you won't have to mess with SE. if you want to put your docs somewhere else, it's not hard to change the context.
Mar 19 14:59:22 <oDiafanos>	i'm in /var/www/html/ as httpd.conf uses it for root folder
Mar 19 15:01:15 <oDiafanos>	fedora 31 server , default httpd installation
Mar 19 15:02:44 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, what about 2 and 3 that I mentioned above?
Mar 19 15:05:22 <oDiafanos>	2. docs.conf 3. https://pastebin.com/yQ4JGE11
Mar 19 15:07:39 <oDiafanos>	diferent directories is the solution
Mar 19 15:08:37 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: So, you fixed it?
Mar 19 15:08:39 <oDiafanos>	i just made 3 test sites in subfolders and they work
Mar 19 15:08:42 <oDiafanos>	yes
Mar 19 15:08:55 <oDiafanos>	well... i learned how it works :P
Mar 19 15:09:20 <oDiafanos>	thank you for explaining
Mar 19 15:09:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  like i said if the first one works its easy to cut and paste for the rest

Mar 19 16:18:16 <dbristow>	Southern_Gentlem: So you were right, it is taking a while to finish seeding 32_Beta Labs x86_64
Mar 19 16:19:37 <dbristow>	Astronomy_KDE and Design_suite finished but the rest are mostly 0kB/s
Mar 19 16:26:10 <devid>	why is the weather in my gnome panel showing as the first entry, time 01:00 with value "--" ?
Mar 19 16:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, now that i turn them off they should come up
Mar 19 16:32:04 <Khaytsus>	I've never seeded those, honestly..  just the base spins.  It've send up 16G for KDE, 15G for Mate, 8G for XFCE, 4G for LXDE, 5G for LXQT, 13G for Cinnamon, 40G for Workstation
Mar 19 16:35:16 <dbristow>	Khaytsus: I may do that for 32 actual.
Mar 19 16:35:22 <dbristow>	Normally I don't torrent betas.
Mar 19 16:35:48 <Khaytsus>	I usually seed beta and release
Mar 19 17:01:56 <linux_user>	Subscription-manager is a paid service no? Why is Fedora telling me I need to pay for it to have updates?
Mar 19 17:02:13 <linux_user>	or why is Fedora saying I need to use subscription manager?
Mar 19 17:02:35 <sbroz>	linux_user: where? are you sure you're actually on fedora?
Mar 19 17:02:59 <Sheogorath[m]>	linux_user: Where does it say this?

Mar 19 17:03:45 <Venemo>	hey guys. does RPM Fusion work with Fedora 32 yet?
Mar 19 17:04:17 *	fedbot removes quiet on *!*@71.38.204.217
Mar 19 17:04:47 <linux_user>	https://pastebin.com/YBVs50xV
Mar 19 17:05:39 <Khaytsus>	Venemo: rpmfusion is not typically something that you use when testing Fedora.
Mar 19 17:05:52 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: You installed that, so..
Mar 19 17:06:05 <linux_user>	huh? I never install subscription-manager!
Mar 19 17:06:07 <linux_user>	that is a lie
Mar 19 17:06:54 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 17:08:10 <Venemo>	Khaytsus: I respectfully disagree, it usually is. AFAIK usually rpmfusion rawhide is usable on the latest fedora beta, at least that's my past experience

Mar 19 17:10:39 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: Perhaps you use Cockpit?  Apparently it's easily enabled from there, leading to this.  Fedora does not install that package by default.
Mar 19 17:11:36 <linux_user>	I do use Cockpit yet
Mar 19 17:11:44 <linux_user>	all I did was do a system update with it.
Mar 19 17:11:49 <linux_user>	let me look at cockpit
Mar 19 17:11:55 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps you enabled the subscription stuff from there.  Anyway, just remove suscription-manager
Mar 19 17:13:50 <linux_user>	hmm....ok, I see that in Applications now! very odd, as I don't remember doing that - however, I did remove it and am rebooting
Mar 19 17:14:07 <linux_user>	I know subscription-manager is for paid support, so I would not know why I'd have ever enabled it!
Mar 19 17:14:31 <Khaytsus>	nor do we
Mar 19 17:15:21 <linux_user>	I will surely need to be more careful about noticing if that is enabled on Fedora systems I work with in the future as well.
Mar 19 17:15:34 <Khaytsus>	It will not be unless you do it.
Mar 19 17:21:27 <linux_user>	I also un-installed subscription-manager
Mar 19 17:22:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	subscription manager got added to fedora for some reason back in f30 iirc
Mar 19 17:23:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	live would not build without it for some reason which was later fixed
Mar 19 17:34:03 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: He's making claims that it installed itself, however, which is not true.  the package itself as part of Fedora, not sure
Mar 19 17:44:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so if he installed f30 then dnf upgraded it would still be on his machine
Mar 19 18:05:30 <bern>	apologies for reposting, but I've not been able to find an answer to this online.
Mar 19 18:05:39 <bern>	I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 18:09:45 <moowhool>	Hello everyone. Is it the right place to suggest changes to the `dnf` package manager ?
Mar 19 18:12:35 <FranciscoD>	moowhool: #yum, github, their mailing list
Mar 19 18:13:18 <moowhool>	FrancsisoD: Thank you very much
Mar 19 18:22:15 <plundra>	bern: /etc/crypto-policies/config
Mar 19 18:22:40 <plundra>	bern: Read the man-page of update-crypto-policies
Mar 19 18:24:56 <cberg>	the 'verfiy' link on https://alt.fedoraproject.org/ for the netinstall (aka everything) doesn't work (404)
Mar 19 18:27:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg which netinstall
Mar 19 18:27:59 <bern>	plundra: thanks, looks like it's actually /etc/crypto-policies/local.d, but your pointer helped me find that
Mar 19 18:28:04 <cberg>	Southern_Gentlem: the one on that page under "Everything" (I suppose that's the official name for the netinst now)
Mar 19 18:28:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg, not all mirrors carry the beta
Mar 19 18:28:22 <cberg>	that's still F31
Mar 19 18:28:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	give me the full link

Mar 19 18:31:15 <Acru>	Hey, I am currently having a problem with Fedora 31 on a Lenovo W520, up until yesterday my integrated webcam worked without problems, but when trying to use it again today, it does not work at all, so it does not seem to transmit any pictures (e.g. chees is just black and the buttons are greyed out)
Mar 19 18:31:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	try http://mirror.cc.vt.edu/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Everything/x86_64/iso/
Mar 19 18:31:47 <cberg>	that does have the Checksum file, thanks Southern_Gentlem
Mar 19 18:31:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, so what changed from yesterday to today
Mar 19 18:31:59 <Acru>	I did some updates
Mar 19 18:32:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so what have tested
Mar 19 18:32:26 <Acru>	Sorry?
Mar 19 18:32:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	you did some updates so that must of caused the issue
Mar 19 18:33:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	what have you tested out of those updates
Mar 19 18:33:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 18:34:17 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/56ce6034
Mar 19 18:34:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg,  and there are the updated isos in the topic (and the Respins Sig is testing a new batch at the moment
Mar 19 18:35:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru,  first thing i would try would be booting into your older kernel
Mar 19 18:35:54 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem I already tried that, but it did not fix the isue
Mar 19 18:38:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru dnf history |fpaste
Mar 19 18:38:46 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/501a04f9
Mar 19 18:39:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	start looking at dnf history info 344 and work yourway back to the top
Mar 19 18:41:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	also i disagree with ever using the -y switch you need to see where stuff is being installed from
Mar 19 18:41:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	especially when you have so many third party repos
Mar 19 18:42:58 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem any further info what that might mean? `Failed to try-restart pesign.service: Unit pesign.service not found.`
Mar 19 18:44:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	not out the top of my head
Mar 19 18:44:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	so look through your journalctl and see if you see anymore errors

Mar 20 10:23:42 <tete_>	hi, i am facing a problem with my soundcard (creative soundblaster xae-5 or so...). the profile which is used as default in pavu control is wrong. everytime i reboot my machine, it is set to digital input/output, but that is wrong, it is analog surround 5.1 + analog stereo input. can someone tell me how to fix that?
Mar 20 10:23:52 <tete_>	its so annoying
Mar 20 11:30:07 <daniel-wtd>	Hi all, I am having a monitor connected via usb-c. It also provides a usb hub, which connects stuff like keyboard, mouse. The issue ist, that everytime the notebook goes to "blank screen", the whole monitor is disconnected and therefore all peripherals, too. Do you see any option (aside disabling screen lock) to address this?

Mar 20 15:50:21 <corshmock>	Hi all
Mar 20 15:51:00 <corshmock>	I'm trying to install OneDrive from this link but getting error.  https://fedora.pkgs.org/31/fedora-updates-x86_64/onedrive-2.3.12-1.fc31.x86_64.rpm.html
Mar 20 15:51:23 <corshmock>	Has anyone successfully install OneDrive on Fedora Workstation 31?  Newbie here
Mar 20 15:51:32 <kwizart>	corshmock, why not use it from the repository; dnf install onedrive
Mar 20 15:52:12 <corshmock>	kwizart: that's exactly what I did, but I got an error (can post pastebin) but it doesn't appear to have installed.
Mar 20 15:53:07 <kwizart>	corshmock,  sudo dnf install onedrive | paste
Mar 20 15:54:55 <corshmock>	I'll try that thank kwizart
Mar 20 15:57:01 <corshmock>	https://paste.centos.org/view/f37e830c
Mar 20 15:57:18 <corshmock>	It asks for a response url ??
Mar 20 16:03:29 <kwizart>	corshmock, it's already installed. now I cannot help with using onedrive, I guess you need to use it from an associated account in the desktop environnement
Mar 20 16:04:01 <kwizart>	corshmock, in gnome, there is the oneline account application that might help to configure the microsoft account to be used with onedrive and others applications...
Mar 20 16:06:27 <corshmock>	oneline kwizart ?  Can't find any such thing.  I'm logged into onedrive in firefox but when I paste that url in, it says Could not initialize the OneDrive API
Mar 20 16:08:56 <Khaytsus>	https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive  has usage info
Mar 20 16:13:51 <launchpadmcquak>	does anybody know how to reference a local path (not http) repo properly in mock?  mock in fedora 31 appears to ignore file:/// repos outright
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	was lead to here in my googling: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki/Plugin-BindMount
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	but I'm not sure what the destination mountpoint should be such that dnf will see it and pull the repodata from it... anybody else stumped by this?
Mar 20 16:15:05 *	mock never ignores files or repos
Mar 20 16:15:33 <Egyptian>	hi - so .. due to work load - i upgraded my work laptop's bios about 10 days ago and finally rebooted today. and now the "windows-like" screen says my disk is corrupt. how do i tell uefi to use the linux partition instead ? and i do not have windows on this machine. this must be the "repair" partition or something
Mar 20 16:15:37 <launchpadmcquak>	seems like it does in recent versions: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki#using-file-urls-in-configs
Mar 20 16:16:25 <launchpadmcquak>	Egyptian: check your boot order, sometimes after a BIOS update UEFI will throw "Windows Boot Manager" back to the top of the list
Mar 20 16:16:42 <corshmock>	kwizart: I think it's working
Mar 20 16:17:12 <launchpadmcquak>	if this is the wrong room for this mock problem, would someone point me to the right room?
Mar 20 16:17:14 <corshmock>	I entered onedrive --monitor and it started downloading everything from my OneDrive.  Thanks very much for you r help
Mar 20 16:19:05 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You are in the right channel. I cannot answer your question. But file:// is the protocol. file:/// indicates root directory.
Mar 20 16:21:34 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./ to be generic about it, or file://, or completely specific with file:///home/mock/. I'm not sure if this is any help, but I'm taking a shot in the dark.
Mar 20 16:22:13 <launchpadmcquak>	wait, you're saying i've been beating my head against a wall over a potential *extra* slash???
Mar 20 16:22:22 <mock>	Maybe
Mar 20 16:23:36 <Khaytsus>	that's alwys tripped me up before too, but pretty sure the URI is file:// so if you want to browse / it would be file:///
Mar 20 16:23:39 <Khaytsus>	but not sure
Mar 20 16:24:02 <mock>	I think we all have run across this at some point.
Mar 20 16:24:08 <launchpadmcquak>	hmmm, still not happy with the double slash: "Curl error (3): URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL for file://nfs/mock/repos/slurm/31/x86_64/repodata/repomd.xml"
Mar 20 16:24:39 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: Is nfs/mock relative or absolute from root?
Mar 20 16:24:52 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./nfs/mock/...
Mar 20 16:25:02 <launchpadmcquak>	the "file:///" approach works just fine in centos 7, no dice in fedora 31 it seems, was working in previous fedoras
Mar 20 16:25:13 <launchpadmcquak>	okay, trying that
Mar 20 16:25:27 <mock>	The configuration is the same for both OSes?
Mar 20 16:29:04 <Khaytsus>	If the absolute path is /nfs I think file:///nfs is correct
Mar 20 16:29:11 <launchpadmcquak>	pretty sure... <frantically trying to figure out how to use pastebin>
Mar 20 16:29:50 <FranciscoD>	launchpadmcquak: pipe command output to fpaste, or give it a file
Mar 20 16:29:55 <FranciscoD>	or copy paste to paste.fp.o
Mar 20 16:30:39 <mock>	Also can you specify the version numbers of the CentOS install and the Fedora 31 install?
Mar 20 16:31:45 <launchpadmcquak>	centos mock: https://pastebin.com/7gX4suCF

Apr 02 10:34:09 <skierpage>	kanarip: no matter, I see it's reported issue with a workaround, https://pagure.io/phabphourphedora/issue/8
Apr 02 11:33:55 <rudrab>	hi, when trying to load my dconf  setting to fedora (setting was created by fedora-31, loading to fedora-31), I am getting error: The operation attempted to modify one or more non-writable keys
Apr 02 11:34:49 <rudrab>	I tried the same file loading to clearlinux, and that worked. So, I guess, my file is ok, fedora has put some lock on dconf
Apr 02 11:34:59 <rudrab>	can anybody kindly help?
Apr 02 11:41:19 <rudrab>	also, /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks is empty
Apr 02 11:44:20 <Khaytsus>	And /etc/dconf/db/database.d/locks
Apr 02 11:45:22 <Khaytsus>	There are 3-4 locks directories..  I don't see anythihng here, but i also don't use gnome's hell
Apr 02 11:46:00 <Khaytsus>	Also make sure your selinux contexts aren't wrong, and obviously permissions
Apr 02 11:46:26 <rudrab>	database.d/ dir doesnt exist
Apr 02 11:46:56 <rudrab>	btw, i am loading the dconf as normal user ...not as root
Apr 02 11:47:07 <ersen>	are you trying to import '/org/gnome/login-screen' ?
Apr 02 11:47:56 <rudrab>	ersen: you mean org/gnome/login-screen]enable-fingerprint-authentication=trueenable-password-authentication=trueenable-smartcard-authentication=false lines?
Apr 02 11:48:12 <ersen>	yes
Apr 02 11:48:18 <rudrab>	yes...those are there
Apr 02 11:48:27 <ersen>	exclude them and try again
Apr 02 11:49:21 <rudrab>	is there any option to exclude? or I just delete them?
Apr 02 11:49:49 <ersen>	just delete them if you are trying to import from a file
Apr 02 11:50:30 <rudrab>	ah...great. that was the culprit
Apr 02 11:51:16 <rudrab>	thanks ersen
Apr 02 11:51:47 <ersen>	you are welcome
Apr 02 11:56:57 <miscing>	Hi, i have a strange issue. I have an external keyboard connected to my laptop. However certain commands don't work, for example i have binded ctrl+ctrl to change keyboard layout. It triggers correctly on laptop, but not with external keyboard. I used XEV to double check that the keycodes send are the exact same on each keyboard. Any suggestions
Apr 02 11:56:57 <miscing>	what it could be/where to look?

Apr 02 13:38:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz_, was there a winehq for f31?
Apr 02 13:39:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	a quick look at koji that would be a NO
Apr 02 13:39:45 <coz_>	Southern_Gentlem, yes there was
Apr 02 13:40:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	give me the koji link for it
Apr 02 13:41:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz_, not in the fedora or rpmfusion repos
Apr 02 13:41:13 <coz_>	no hold on

Apr 02 15:43:38 <AlexMax>	Nothing.
Apr 02 15:43:47 <AlexMax>	HOWEVER, I am running docker.
Apr 02 15:44:01 <billings>	is it the docker container that's having that issue?
Apr 02 15:44:01 <AlexMax>	And I do have that kernel option enabled that allows me to run docker
Apr 02 15:44:03 <mrvenkman>	That'll be it
Apr 02 15:44:13 <AlexMax>	(Sorry, I wanted to use podman, but i needed docker-compose)
Apr 02 15:44:33 <billings>	there's a podman-compose but it doesn't work with user containers
Apr 02 15:44:41 <billings>	so you have to sudo like a caveman
Apr 02 15:44:47 <AlexMax>	Yeah I saw, plus it looked sparsely maintained
Apr 02 15:44:58 <mrvenkman>	So I guess he doesn't have to worry, billings ?
Apr 02 15:45:32 <AlexMax>	I have no docker containers running though
Apr 02 15:45:45 <AlexMax>	They're all stopped
Apr 02 15:46:43 <mrvenkman>	can you telnet to yourip:8080 ?
Apr 02 15:46:55 <AlexMax>	I tried netcat, connection refused
Apr 02 15:47:36 <mrvenkman>	I'm out of suggestions mate :( Sorry. (I'm quite new though)
Apr 02 15:47:48 <AlexMax>	No, I appreciate your help
Apr 02 15:48:02 <mrvenkman>	:)
Apr 02 15:48:03 <AlexMax>	that goes for everybody ITC
Apr 02 15:48:51 <billings>	not sure what else could be hanging on to that port but not reporting it through lsof
Apr 02 15:49:03 <billings>	don't kill -9 in the future
Apr 02 15:49:04 <AlexMax>	OH SON OF A GUN
Apr 02 15:49:15 <AlexMax>	Oh man this is the biggest PBKAC in the world
Apr 02 15:49:30 <AlexMax>	Don't know if I should even say what it was because oh man I'm embarassed.
Apr 02 15:50:08 <AlexMax>	Rest assured, it was my fault, and I'm sorry that I sent everybody on a wild goose chase.
Apr 02 15:50:19 <mrvenkman>	hahah
Apr 02 15:50:23 <mrvenkman>	wrong shell?
Apr 02 15:50:32 <AlexMax>	No.  I wasn't scrolled up all the way.
Apr 02 15:50:40 <mrvenkman>	LOL
Apr 02 15:50:51 <AlexMax>	And missed where there was a second server create that I had forgotten about, from some testing I had done.
Apr 02 15:51:14 <mrvenkman>	AlexMax, "Usually when I fix these sort of obscure problems I learn something."
Apr 02 15:51:35 <AlexMax>	Hey, you joke, but I still learned something.
Apr 02 15:51:37 <AlexMax>	I had no idea ss was even a thing.
Apr 02 15:51:39 <mrvenkman>	You learned to check
Apr 02 15:51:46 <AlexMax>	Another tool for the toolbelt.
Apr 02 15:51:53 <mrvenkman>	Good man :)
Apr 02 15:52:30 <billings>	ss is effectively the replacement for netstat
Apr 02 15:52:35 <billings>	which is no longer maintained iirc
Apr 02 15:58:52 <mrvenkman>	Question: is my location and router IP address visible to everyone here?
Apr 02 15:59:43 <billings>	mrvenkman: ~mrvenkman@cpc127002-macc4-2-0-cust55.1-3.cable.virginm.net
Apr 02 16:00:03 <mrvenkman>	ok
Apr 02 16:00:05 <mrvenkman>	:(
Apr 02 16:00:11 <billings>	you can get a freenode mask
Apr 02 16:00:20 <mrvenkman>	how do I do that?
Apr 02 16:00:38 <mrvenkman>	I am worried that Southern_Gentlem is buying a shit load of movies.
Apr 02 16:00:45 <billings>	cloak, rather
Apr 02 16:00:47 <billings>	https://freenode.net/kb/answer/cloaks
Apr 02 16:00:50 <billings>	sorry
Apr 02 16:00:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman, i dont have time for that
Apr 02 16:00:56 <mrvenkman>	billings, thanks.
Apr 02 16:01:02 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, lol!
Apr 02 16:01:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	and google for fedora cloaks
Apr 02 16:01:21 <billings>	for example, my cloak makes me appear in whois as ~root@centos/community/billings
Apr 02 16:01:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  i have been here since fc1 so i am here to help, i have making fedora respins since fc5
Apr 02 16:02:00 <mrvenkman>	billings, would you say it's pretty insecure for me to not have a cloak?
Apr 02 16:02:06 <billings>	eh
Apr 02 16:02:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	no
Apr 02 16:02:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	i have a cloak because i am a chanop
Apr 02 16:02:30 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks :)
Apr 02 16:04:35 <mrvenkman>	Could you guys hack my router?
Apr 02 16:04:43 <mrvenkman>	If you wanted.
Apr 02 16:05:10 <mrvenkman>	Can I have a cloak?
Apr 02 16:05:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  not with that no
Apr 02 16:05:49 <mrvenkman>	I'm worried now.
Apr 02 16:05:56 <mrvenkman>	Ok, :) Phew!
Apr 02 16:06:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  be sure that you are not running your routors default passphrase
Apr 02 16:06:47 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, I don't think I am. :)
Apr 02 16:07:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	dont think KNOW
Apr 02 16:08:50 <mrvenkman>	I suppose the passphrase will probably be just ""
Apr 02 16:09:03 <mrvenkman>	So I know.
Apr 02 16:09:03 <mrvenkman>	lol
Apr 02 16:10:18 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, thank you for your help since fc1
Apr 02 16:10:31 <mrvenkman>	The system is running lovely.
Apr 02 16:11:32 <mrvenkman>	I have Fedora31 running on a Ryzen5 processor, lenovo ideapad c340

Apr 02 16:37:41 <sdgathman>	When I update the kernel on f31, it uses the wrong LV for grubby.
Apr 02 16:38:08 <sdgathman>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b4ae44c2
Apr 02 16:38:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman, well it very funny that all this strange stuff always happens to you
Apr 02 16:38:37 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: because I experiment.
Apr 02 16:38:42 <sdgathman>	The correct LV is f31
Apr 02 16:38:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes because you love to shoot yourself in the foot
Apr 02 16:39:31 <sdgathman>	Background: I did an install of test version of Fedora to LV root, using the same /boot
Apr 02 16:39:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	and 5.5.13 pushed this morning as well
Apr 02 16:40:21 <sdgathman>	So the insns to use root LV are stored somewhere in /boot
Apr 02 16:40:43 <sdgathman>	BLS does this
Apr 02 16:41:29 <sdgathman>	I suppose I could switch back to BLSCFG=false
Apr 02 16:41:41 <sdgathman>	But I do try to use the new stuff in Fedora.
Apr 02 16:42:13 <sdgathman>	So, where does BLS store the root LV to use ??
Apr 02 16:42:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	no idea
Apr 02 16:42:37 <sdgathman>	I tried updating all kernels with grubby - didn't help.  (Other than the one I just installed.)
Apr 02 16:43:19 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: 5.5.13 is waiting to test whatever advice I receive (not from you, obviously).  This problem only happens on kernel update.
Apr 02 16:43:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	5.5.13 pushed to the mirrors this morning at 4am
Apr 02 16:43:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	edt
Apr 02 16:44:07 <sdgathman>	I am fully aware.  I get the emails.  See above.
Apr 02 16:44:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman,  is bls default in fedora
Apr 02 16:44:48 <sdgathman>	Yes
Apr 02 16:45:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	then why are you the only one with issues
Apr 02 16:45:05 <sdgathman>	GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
Apr 02 16:46:05 <sdgathman>	I am not personally in any danger - it is easy enough to run grubby to fix it.
Apr 02 16:47:03 <sdgathman>	And if I forget, to edit the kernel args in grub
Apr 02 16:48:30 <sdgathman>	The goal is to find out why grubby does this, and if it turns out to be a bug (as opposed to "BLS doesn't support multiple installs with same /boot"), then fix it.
Apr 02 16:49:29 <sdgathman>	This is not something that would endanger a regular Fedora user that doesn't have multiple Fedora installs on a desktop.
Apr 02 16:50:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	i would be more worried about win/fedora/other linux distro
Apr 02 16:54:14 <sdgathman>	BLS also breaks the upgrade procedure here: https://fedoramagazine.org/use-lvm-upgrade-fedora/
Apr 02 16:56:10 <sdgathman>	Googling "where does BLS get its data" tells me lots of stuff about Bureau of Labor Statistics :-)
Apr 02 17:01:46 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: in grub2.cfg there is a line:
Apr 02 17:02:03 <sdgathman>	set default_kernelopts="root=/dev/mapper/vg_melissa-f31 ro resume=/dev/mapper/vg_melissa-swap rd.lvm.lv=vg_melissa/f31 rd.lvm.lv=vg_melissa/swap rhgb quiet"
Apr 02 17:02:14 <sdgathman>	Which I just changed from root to f31
Apr 02 17:02:31 <sdgathman>	About to update to 5.5.13 and see if that fixes it.
Apr 02 17:03:51 *	Southern_Gentlem wishes we could tell livemedia-creator to alwayss install and verify the kernel last 
Apr 02 17:07:23 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: Nope.  Changing default_kernelopts did not fix it..  And, I've used up my update.
Apr 02 17:08:28 <sdgathman>	the /boot/loader/entries have this line: options $kernelopts
Apr 02 17:08:43 <sdgathman>	The the question is, where does kernelopts come from ???
Apr 02 17:09:29 <cheese-e-boi>	Hello, I am making a spin of Fedora and I am trying to create a package with configurations files, however this causes a package conflict when they're installed. What would be a better way of changing the default configuration files of the system in a manner that will not cause this issue?
Apr 02 17:09:53 <sdgathman>	BLS also stands for Basic Life Support
Apr 02 17:11:21 <Khaytsus>	cheese-e-boi: rebuild your own packages with those configs?
Apr 02 17:11:30 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651686
Apr 02 17:12:00 <sdgathman>	Looks like you have to edit the grub2 environment variable.  Which is *not* friendly.
Apr 02 17:12:43 <sdgathman>	Eh, it's no worse than grubby
Apr 02 17:13:26 <cheese-e-boi>	Khaytsus: I guess I could but it just seems a bit overkill. But if that's the only option, I guess I'll do that. Thank you
Apr 02 17:13:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, what are you doing
Apr 02 17:14:25 <josvuk>	hello, i have f31 running in vbox on win10 host, know i have to make a backup because i have to rezise my system hd (only somme MB free) what tool should i use?
Apr 02 17:14:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, why not change those configs in the ks
Apr 02 17:14:55 <cheese-e-boi>	I'm attempting to make a Spin of Fedora with XFCE with some configuration changes using livecd-tools
Apr 02 17:15:17 <cheese-e-boi>	I might do that too
Apr 02 17:15:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	what changes are you making and did you start with the xfce ks or did you create your own
Apr 02 17:15:43 <cheese-e-boi>	It just sounded simpler to do that within a package but you're probably right
Apr 02 17:16:15 <cheese-e-boi>	I started with the base and repo kickstarts
Apr 02 17:16:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Livemedia-creator-_How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD
Apr 02 17:16:46 <Khaytsus>	What are you specifically trying to accompilsh, maybe Southern_Gentlem can suggest a better way
Apr 02 17:17:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	pull and flatten the xfce ks
Apr 02 17:17:19 <cheese-e-boi>	That's what I'm doing actually
Apr 02 17:17:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	be sure you edit fedora.repo and set to non-rawhide
Apr 02 17:17:33 <cheese-e-boi>	But I want to change the default shell for zsh first of all
Apr 02 17:17:41 <cheese-e-boi>	Yeah I've messed around for a bit with that
Apr 02 17:17:44 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: Setting an entry with grubby replaces $kernelopts with the new setting
Apr 02 17:18:17 <cheese-e-boi>	If you want to see what I've done I could send the gitlab link
Apr 02 17:18:22 <sdgathman>	So changing grub2 env changes all entries still using $kernelopts
Apr 02 17:19:12 <sdgathman>	Is there a way to make grubby use /etc/default/grub instead of a grub2 env variable ?
Apr 02 17:19:21 <cheese-e-boi>	Actually, I'll probably not make a package for this stuff; I'll just do it manually. Thanks for the help though
Apr 02 17:20:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman, no
Apr 02 17:20:49 <sdgathman>	Maybe changing grub2.cfg to set kernelopts=... instead of set default_kernelopts=...
Apr 02 17:24:30 <sdgathman>	I'll try that out when testing f32 beta
Apr 02 17:37:51 <drindt>	hello ladies and gents, i appreciate your support. I open with nautilus an smb share (same since years) and from now on the permissions are shown wrong, timestamps too and so on. When i go in the mounted folder from gvfs it shows the same issues. So its not nautilus related. Opened the share with windows as usual, works as expected and the years before. Haven't found any information about this strange issue. Maybe someone can help me? Thank you
Apr 02 17:37:53 <drindt>	for reading.
Apr 02 17:44:47 <sdgathman>	drindt: I remember reading that Windows had changed CIFS security protocol, but I don't remember where.  Is the share served by an updated Windows box?
Apr 02 17:45:39 <icebp241>	im trying to do a fresh 31 install on kvm on a host running 31. when the iso boot i see graphics, but not anaconda
Apr 02 17:45:56 <icebp241>	i cant switch to it, i left it alone for a few, i get nadda
Apr 02 17:46:22 <drindt>	 the security is not the issue, i fixed that already, but now files are shown as folders and with wrong timestamps
Apr 02 17:46:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	icebp241, what iso are you using
Apr 02 17:46:52 <icebp241>	Southern_Gentlem Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-31-1.9.iso
Apr 02 17:47:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	grab the updated iso out of the topic
Apr 02 17:47:21 <icebp241>	alright, thanks
Apr 02 17:47:49 <Khaytsus>	drindt: What change from when it worked to when it didn't
Apr 02 17:48:23 <drindt>	Khaytsus: i would like to know it too. :) I assume this happens after the last fedora upgrade but not sure.
Apr 02 17:49:34 <sdgathman>	drindt: Is this related?  https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STXKQY_4.2.1/com.ibm.spectrum.scale.v4r21.doc/bl1pdg_winsmb2.htm
Apr 02 17:49:57 <sdgathman>	Is Windows or Fedora (or something else) serving the CIFS share?
Apr 02 17:51:10 <drindt>	It's a fritz.box, a router
Apr 02 17:51:26 <sdgathman>	Using SMB1 or SMB2 ?
Apr 02 17:51:51 <sdgathman>	And has the fritz.box been updated? :-)
Apr 02 17:53:26 <sdgathman>	SMB2 requires accurate change notification implementation - without it you get "inconsistent view of the namespace".
Apr 02 17:53:43 <icebp241>	Southern_Gentlem no luck with F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20200319.iso either
Apr 02 17:54:05 <sdgathman>	icebp241: how much RAM for the VM?
Apr 02 17:54:14 <sdgathman>	I think you need at least 2G now.
Apr 02 17:54:24 <icebp241>	sdgathman 8GB
Apr 02 17:54:31 <icebp241>	4 vCPUs
Apr 02 17:54:33 <sdgathman>	That should be no problem.
Apr 02 17:55:03 *	sdgathman just upgraded from 8 to 16GB on VM host in Jan...
Apr 02 17:55:54 <chilversc>	sdgathman: can you get to a text terminal and check journalctl / dmesg?
Apr 02 17:56:23 <sdgathman>	chilversc: for what problem?
Apr 02 17:56:42 <sdgathman>	Or did you mean icebp241?
Apr 02 17:58:26 <icebp241>	chilversc nothing stands out
Apr 02 17:58:43 <chilversc>	sdgathman: sorry, got the wrong nick there

Apr 03 09:23:54 <Cymew>	Hi. I just wrote a markdown document in emacs, and when I want to preview it, I seems to be lacking a "markdown" binary to render it. Which package provides that? It seems dnf is not helpful.
Apr 03 09:33:09 <Cymew>	Nevermind, found the "discount" package.
Apr 03 09:57:57 <marmulak>	is it normal for dnf to segfault after downloading package files
Apr 03 09:58:31 <[Enrico]>	nope
Apr 03 09:59:09 <marmulak>	isn't that weird
Apr 03 11:31:41 <rindolf>	Hi all! I am getting an OCI error with podman/docker on f32 - https://paste.centos.org/view/43bd2158
Apr 03 11:39:33 <rindolf>	it seems to be working as user 'root' :(
Apr 03 11:47:14 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: hrm, not seen that: is this a fresh install?
Apr 03 11:47:17 <FranciscoD>	or an upgrade?
Apr 03 11:47:47 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: an upgrade
Apr 03 11:47:54 <FranciscoD>	hrm, me too
Apr 03 11:48:04 <FranciscoD>	anything in the journal: `journalctl -b` ?
Apr 03 11:49:08 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: trying to reproduce it now
Apr 03 11:49:36 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: worked here XD
Apr 03 11:50:26 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: oh, that sucks
Apr 03 11:51:00 <FranciscoD>	https://paste.centos.org/view/23b17a71
Apr 03 11:51:41 <FranciscoD>	will need some debugging, not sure where to start though.
Apr 03 11:51:42 <FranciscoD>	try #podman?
Apr 03 11:53:02 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: https://paste.centos.org/view/66b1d19c
Apr 03 11:54:03 <FranciscoD>	I some context related info
Apr 03 11:54:08 <FranciscoD>	selinux labelling maybe?
Apr 03 11:54:59 <FranciscoD>	try the selinux troubleshooter? `sudo dnf install /usr/bin/sealert`?
Apr 03 11:55:05 <FranciscoD>	that'll list denials
Apr 03 11:55:35 <FranciscoD>	simple way of checking is also to `sudo setenforce 0` to temporarily set selinux to permissive and checking if it works
Apr 03 12:11:56 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: sudo setenforce 0 did not help
Apr 03 12:15:21 <FranciscoD>	aye, lets hope the #podman folks can help figure it out
Apr 03 12:19:23 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: thanks
Apr 03 14:31:25 *	billings wonders if cgroupsv2 was disabled
Apr 03 15:40:42 <mfilipe[m]>	something is wrong with my software store. flathub already updated the riot app but my software store doesn't show it to update. anyone knows what is wrong?
Apr 03 15:48:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	had you applied updates earlier and it applied and you didnt realize
Apr 03 15:48:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	??
Apr 03 15:50:30 <retentiveboy>	Feeling silly for having to ask...  FServer31 instance in a VM without issues. Shutdown, added second network interface, booted back up.  Can't SSH into it now on the original interface but can on DHCP address it pulled on the added interface. tcpdump shows first packet of Inbound connection on the original interface then stalls.
Apr 03 15:51:08 <retentiveboy>	Disabled firewall, no change.  disabled selinux, no change.
Apr 03 15:51:40 <retentiveboy>	netstat -an show it's listening on 0.0.0.0:22 as expected.
Apr 03 15:51:58 <retentiveboy>	adjusted sshd configs to listen on the original IP, not 0.0.0.0. no change.
Apr 03 15:52:21 <Puck`>	how about firewalls, retentiveboy ?
Apr 03 15:52:32 <Puck`>	try stopping firewalld sercice
Apr 03 15:52:35 <Puck`>	*service
Apr 03 15:52:43 <retentiveboy>	systemctl stop firewalld, no change.
Apr 03 15:53:26 <retentiveboy>	tcpdump shows initial inbound packet so no firewall on the client in the way.
Apr 03 15:53:51 <retentiveboy>	weird.
Apr 03 15:54:01 <prussian>	firewalld may be activated via dbus/socket
Apr 03 15:54:11 <prussian>	if you really want it dead, systemctl mask firewalld
Apr 03 15:54:13 <dowdle>	retentiveboy: When working with multiple network interfaces, I'm guessing you need to mark one of them as "do not use this as a default gateway".
Apr 03 15:54:14 <retentiveboy>	iptables -L shows empty tables
Apr 03 15:55:14 <retentiveboy>	ah, yes...  routing issue.  I see responses going out the other interface.
Apr 03 15:55:23 <retentiveboy>	thx, dowdle
Apr 03 15:55:46 <prussian>	I was just gonna say, check ip route output

Apr 03 23:35:07 <alloy>	greetings #fedora :)
Apr 03 23:37:00 <alloy>	I've got fedora server 31 running in vmware workstation as a test machine.... the network adaptor ens33 keeps dropping out then coming back, is this something you'all see a lot of?
Apr 03 23:39:53 <daniel-wtd>	alloy: In vsphere/esx and kvm or vagrant (libvirt) I cannot see this behaviour. Havent used vmware workstation for years. :/
Apr 03 23:40:20 <alloy>	it's one of the few pieces of software I buy :)
Apr 03 23:40:51 <alloy>	(not because I'm some rabid pirate, it's just super useful - works really nicely with esx as a console etc)
Apr 03 23:42:06 <alloy>	I think it might be a vmware thing, although I have an identical VM running ubuntu server and that doesn't seem to do it... (i'm pairing the terminals to test commands in both distros)
Apr 03 23:45:09 <alloy>	oops, sorry to bother yas, it's happening in ubuntu too...
Apr 03 23:45:16 *	alloy shakes fist at vmware
Apr 03 23:45:59 <alloy>	daniel-wtd, give workstation pro a go though, it's fine software (this glitch not withstanding) :D
Apr 03 23:46:12 <alloy>	ciao
Apr 03 23:46:26 <daniel-wtd>	im using vsphere only because custmers have it in use ^^
Apr 03 23:46:40 <daniel-wtd>	for me and my company, 100% open source for infrastructure ^^
Apr 03 23:47:12 <specing>	alloy: stop promoting proprietary software. It is not cool.
Apr 03 23:48:05 <alloy>	specing, hah really?  vmware have done so much for Linux I disagree.
Apr 03 23:48:59 <alloy>	I've been using GNU/Linux since the 90s, everything I do is opensource, I've contributed code, and like I said it's one of the only things I buy because it helps my work as a career Linux Engineer so much.
Apr 03 23:49:24 <alloy>	it was a tip, not a promotion.
Apr 03 23:49:30 <specing>	Like violate the GPL?
Apr 03 23:49:42 <alloy>	so you are anti Red Hat then?
Apr 03 23:49:42 <daniel-wtd>	nevertheless, this is a fedora channel and not a "lets promote your personal software preference" channel
Apr 03 23:49:51 <daniel-wtd>	Red Hat = Open Source
Apr 03 23:51:32 <alloy>	wow, you guys need to relax.
Apr 03 23:54:27 <alloy>	it was a friend of mine (another mike) that noticed vmware were using the kernel in the way they were back in the early 2000s, since then they have changed that, it's old news.
Apr 03 23:54:28 <dowdle>	alloy: I bought VMware for Linux in 1999... and ran Windows 98 in it.  We use VMware at work... not me though... I prefer the Linux native hypervisor, KVM.
Apr 03 23:54:49 <alloy>	dowdle, yeah that's when I started using it too :)
Apr 03 23:56:53 <dowdle>	alloy: I work for a university and we subscribe to some academic program VMware has (admin'ed by On-the-Hub) and I could get VMware at no cost to me, but I prefer to use KVM.  I'm not fond of building kernel stubb modules every time the kernel gets updated... and Fedora is usually pretty darn closed to the latest, greatest upstream kernel release... which 3rd party modules sometimes have a problem with.

Apr 04 17:16:00 <FixPleaseTo>	it strikes me that maybe developing 64 bit computing would have *begun with* 100% backward compatibility.  otherwise it's a *downgrade* unless of course everything could immediately be ported to 64 bit, and the prior platform made irrelevant.  clearly that scenario didn't come about, so why is there no compatibility?
Apr 04 17:16:41 <FixPleaseTo>	I thought we're telling the compiler to "make 32 bit!" and all it's saying is "unable to comply".  robots have gotten shot in the face for less than that, I believe

Apr 04 22:05:57 <z22_temp>	Hi
Apr 04 22:16:59 <LRB>	Anybody know of a method to disable the disabling of a mouse pad while typing? There's apparently a bug in the xfce4 that's shipping with Fedora 31. I'm just looking for a command or something to directly interact with the settings.
Apr 04 22:27:03 <z22_temp>	For Touchpad in gpaphic env is in system settings/Hardware/Input Devices/Touchpad/EnableDisable Toouchpad ...
Apr 04 22:31:04 <LRB>	I'm not really sure what you mean. I'm not seeing that in xfce4-settings-editor or xfce4-settings-manager
Apr 04 22:33:45 <z22_temp>	sorry, i'm in kde, there must be something similar.
Apr 04 22:34:20 <LRB>	There is usually. There's a bug preventing it from appearing in the xfce4-settings-manager
Apr 04 22:34:26 <chrisawi>	LRB: is the xfce spin using libinput or synaptics?
Apr 04 22:34:51 <LRB>	chrisawi: It's using synaptics.
Apr 04 22:35:47 <LRB>	Somebody said to install xorg-x11-drv-synaptics-legacy but that caused my touchpad to ignore the "natural scrolling" or whatever it's called in xfce4
Apr 04 22:36:00 <LRB>	reversed scrolling
Apr 04 22:36:34 <chrisawi>	if that package wasn't installed already, then you were using libinput before
Apr 04 22:37:04 <LRB>	Ah. It's showing up as a synaptics device even when the package isn't installed, so maybe that's why I was confused
Apr 04 22:38:40 <chrisawi>	for libinput, you can configure it at runtime with xinput like this: https://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/a/9306
Apr 04 22:39:10 <chrisawi>	for the synaptics driver, there is a `synclient` command
Apr 04 22:39:34 <LRB>	Ah cool, thanks

Apr 10 13:32:53 <Araneidae>	Just install F32 on a laptop and need to connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network: can't see an option for this!
Apr 10 13:34:08 <Araneidae>	The only option seems to be "Select a network" which doesn't include my network
Apr 10 13:34:29 <Khaytsus>	WHy would it show a hidden network?  btw, hidden networks are ONLY annoying, they do NOTHING useful.
Apr 10 13:34:37 <Araneidae>	That's as may be
Apr 10 13:34:57 <Khaytsus>	The network SSID is visible about every 5 seconds if you're watching for traffic, so it's pretty utterly pointless and annoying and does nothing.
Apr 10 13:35:01 <Araneidae>	You're not telling me the ability to select a hidden network has been removed because its "annoying"?
Apr 10 13:35:17 <Khaytsus>	No, I'm saying having it hidden is pointlessly annoying for you.
Apr 10 13:35:29 <Khaytsus>	I'm booting a machine with network mangler
Apr 10 13:35:52 <Araneidae>	Again, that's as may be.  I'm connecting to a network that has been configured like this for over a decade
Apr 10 13:35:58 <Khaytsus>	Ah welp, that won't work, no wifi on a vm.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's just "Add connection"
Apr 10 13:36:11 <Khaytsus>	If it's your network, just unhide it.
Apr 10 13:36:38 <Araneidae>	Why has this been downgraded?  This is just a retrograde step
Apr 10 13:36:44 <Khaytsus>	Next dumb thing poeple do; mac filtering.  As if the MAC (ie:  wireless ethernet address) isn't also immediately visible.
Apr 10 13:37:07 <Khaytsus>	No idea if it has been.  You're seeing a difference?
Apr 10 13:37:28 <Araneidae>	Yes.  This is my first install of F32, my other machines work jsut fine thank you
Apr 10 13:38:02 <Araneidae>	Presumably something is store somewhere in /etc/networks or the like, suppose I have to go looking now :(
Apr 10 13:38:29 <Khaytsus>	Ah well, was going to look but no NM here except in VMs.  But 99% sure it's just "add connection"
Apr 10 13:39:29 <Araneidae>	"Add Connection" does sound right, but I'm struggling to find it!
Apr 10 13:40:11 <Araneidae>	Under settings I've got Wi-Fi which just shows "Visible Networks" (and an Aeroplane Mode button)
Apr 10 13:40:29 <Araneidae>	Network, which covers Wired, VPN, Proxy
Apr 10 13:40:41 <Khaytsus>	right click the NM applet, edit connections, hit the Plus?
Apr 10 13:41:28 <Araneidae>	The settings box shows a list of entries on the left (which is where I'm seeing Wi-Fi), but it's not right-clickable
Apr 10 13:41:35 <linuxmodder>	like Khaytsus  is saying 'hiding a network' only makes it safe against stupid attackers, anyone that knows how to look is gonna target you more just due to that fact alone
Apr 10 13:42:20 <Khaytsus>	No right click/  Hmm..  looking, sec
Apr 10 13:44:03 <Khaytsus>	Yeah right click NM's applet here shows the normal menus
Apr 10 13:44:21 <Araneidae>	So how do you bring up the Applet?
Apr 10 13:44:44 <Khaytsus>	Oh, well..  hmm..  I'm using XFCE, no idea how it shows up in Gnome I guess
Apr 10 13:44:51 <Araneidae>	All I'm doing is selecting Settings from the Activities Search
Apr 10 13:45:09 <Araneidae>	Oh, it's ****ing Gnome being patronising again, isn't it
Apr 10 13:45:13 <Khaytsus>	but yeah look for Network Connections I think it's called to run?
Apr 10 13:45:23 <Khaytsus>	that hsould bring up the NM app
Apr 10 13:45:45 <Araneidae>	Ohhhh
Apr 10 13:45:45 <Khaytsus>	I don't seem to have a Workstation VM installed at the moment
Apr 10 13:46:06 <Araneidae>	It's hidden under a ... button on the top right of Settings!
Apr 10 13:46:23 <Khaytsus>	Makes sense.
Apr 10 13:46:32 <Araneidae>	Under [...] (vertical dots) is a menu ... with "Connect to Hidden Network..."
Apr 10 13:46:32 <Khaytsus>	I'm not allowed to express my love for Gnome anymore, so.. yeah
Apr 10 13:46:38 <Araneidae>	Ta
Apr 10 13:46:46 <Araneidae>	"Love" for Gnome?
Apr 10 13:46:58 <Khaytsus>	It involves torches and pitchforks
Apr 10 13:47:10 <Araneidae>	I've put it on because I'm lazy (my main desktop is XFCE, my work workstation is fluxbox)
Apr 10 13:47:44 <Araneidae>	Anyhow, thanks for the help.  Think I'm getting there...
Apr 10 13:47:48 <Khaytsus>	Every time I test the Workstation spin I hate every second.
Apr 10 13:48:00 <Khaytsus>	But glad you got it sorted, but yeah, hiding that under a few things seems pretty silly.
Apr 10 13:48:07 <Araneidae>	What's the most robust Fedora Spin that isn't Gnome?
Apr 10 13:48:18 <Khaytsus>	Gnome seems to optimze usability at the expense of usability.
Apr 10 13:48:18 <Araneidae>	I'll watch for that little button elsewhere
Apr 10 13:48:28 <Khaytsus>	I've used XFCE for years personally.
Apr 10 13:52:40 <Khaytsus>	Used KDE for years until it died at 3.5.  I revisit every few years or so, poke at it, put it back in the oven to cook for another few years.
Apr 10 13:53:47 <Araneidae>	Well, we use Gnome at work (I'm out on a limb with fluxbox), and each time there's a system upgrade (such a big damned deal) it seems to get a little harder to use :(
Apr 10 13:54:28 <Khaytsus>	Eventually it'll just be a single button.
Apr 10 13:54:36 <Khaytsus>	They remove features every release.
Apr 10 13:55:09 <Araneidae>	:)

Apr 10 15:16:46 <short-bike>	Anyone in here running wireguard on f31 ?
Apr 10 15:17:46 <mfilipe[m]>	short-bike: o/
Apr 10 15:17:58 <mfilipe[m]>	i'm running inside of my host (fedora package)
Apr 10 15:18:06 <mfilipe[m]>	when i tried to use snap/flatpak, it didn't work as expected
Apr 10 15:19:27 <short-bike>	mfilipe[m]: TY. Apart from that, any other issues you have run into ? I'm looking to run it on an f31 bare metal box.
Apr 10 15:19:44 <mfilipe[m]>	no
Apr 10 15:19:51 <mfilipe[m]>	i used to sniff a http package without problems
Apr 10 15:19:56 <short-bike>	Cool. Thank you.
Apr 10 15:23:32 <short-bike>	Lastly, is the copr repo needed for wireguard ?
Apr 10 15:29:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	you can look to see if the copr package is newer than whats in the fedora repos
Apr 10 15:33:11 <guiekguiek>	Shouldn't this prompt for username/password since dnf requires sudo privileges? Here is the pastebin https://pastebin.com/50m4aFKX
Apr 10 15:36:03 <Khaytsus>	It uses packagekit, and you've likely already used it before
Apr 10 15:36:46 <Khaytsus>	guiekguiek: Plus you're in the wheel group, yes?
Apr 10 15:38:00 <short-bike>	Southern_Gentlem: Thanks - I'll check.
Apr 10 15:38:36 <guiekguiek>	@Khaytsus yes I am in the wheel group
Apr 10 15:38:51 <Khaytsus>	So yes, that's working as designed.
Apr 10 15:38:52 <guiekguiek>	In sudoers I need to be prompted for password
Apr 10 15:39:10 <guiekguiek>	Is my sudo privilege cached in PackageKit
Apr 10 15:39:14 <Khaytsus>	No.
Apr 10 15:39:17 <Khaytsus>	It's not using sudo.
Apr 10 15:39:38 <guiekguiek>	Can you please explain how it works?
Apr 10 15:40:19 <Khaytsus>	No, but you can research it.
Apr 10 15:41:07 <Khaytsus>	If you want to personally remove what that is doing, just remove the packagekit not found package.
Apr 10 15:41:33 <Khaytsus>	PackageKit-command-not-found
Apr 10 15:44:33 <\n3p\>	Fedora 32 is working fine for me since more than a month. Thank you developers!
Apr 10 15:44:46 <Khaytsus>	10 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, 5 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Apr 10 16:05:53 <FixPleaseTo>	might b I'm just slow, but isn't there supposed to be a command like "magick" in fedora? LOL
Apr 10 16:06:09 <FixPleaseTo>	-for converting graphics files
Apr 10 16:07:37 <Khaytsus>	https://google.com/search?q=image+magick+howto
Apr 10 16:07:59 <short-bike>	imagemagic aka - imagemagick. But the core of those files are installed by default. for ex. convert (file-a) (file-b) by extension works.
Apr 10 16:08:17 <dsmster>	anyone else on fc32 see crun package update fail with :  lsetfilecon: (/usr/bin/crun;5e908afe, system_u:object_r:container_runtime_exec_t:s0) Invalid argument
Apr 10 16:10:22 <Khaytsus>	dsmster: Updating the crun package with dnf you mean, or?
Apr 10 16:10:47 <Khaytsus>	I just updated a 32 here and saw no obvious issues, but wasn't looking closely
Apr 10 16:18:57 <dsmster>	yeah, i noticed that Software app, just spun forever trying to list today's updates, so I ran dnf update, crun wanted to go from 0.13-1 to 0.13-2 and that selinux thing was the only anomoly I noticed so far
Apr 10 16:19:24 <dsmster>	i will go look at the packageutil logs i guess next to see if it's having the same type of problem with crun package
Apr 10 16:19:56 <dsmster>	or maybe this is a script running that is incompatible with some of my personal containers that are quite old IDK
Apr 10 16:22:13 <Khaytsus>	Never used packagekit intentionally, so udnno

Apr 10 16:53:52 <\n3p\>	bhermon, You need rpmfusion-free-updates and rpmfusion-NONFREE + updates for some extra packages
Apr 10 16:54:03 <ledeni>	bhermon,yes you have it
Apr 10 16:54:48 <ledeni>	bhermon, run in term 'sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs compat-ffmpeg'
Apr 10 16:55:34 <ledeni>	bhermon, sorrythis  'sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs compat-ffmpeg28'
Apr 10 16:59:54 <bhermon>	Working on it, seems to take awhile
Apr 10 17:00:30 <ledeni>	bhermon, after that you need h264 codecs read https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenH264
Apr 10 17:05:06 <kwizart>	ledeni, not once you have rpmfusion installed
Apr 10 17:05:32 <kwizart>	I mean ffmpeg (and no need to use the compat-ffmpeg28 anymore for firefox)
Apr 10 17:05:53 <kwizart>	chromium would requires to use the chromium-freeworld package
Apr 10 17:06:23 <ledeni>	bhermon, once you install h264 codec close firefox  and reopen .should be fine after this you can watch videos
Apr 10 17:06:44 <bhermon>	sorry, I was trying to pipe it to fpaste and it stalled at the is this ok? prompt
Apr 10 17:08:00 <ledeni>	bhermon, what you want to pipe
Apr 10 17:11:24 <JEEB>	so I am seeing an issue that after successfully running dnf system upgrade download for 31-to-32 (since I saw that the worst blockers seemed to get closed), when after the reboot the module attempts to do a verification of the RPMs it downloaded, it seems to always fail?
Apr 10 17:11:39 <ledeni>	kwizart, sorry main experience i need compat-ffmpeg28 for run some videos and cost nothing to have it install
Apr 10 17:11:43 <JEEB>	I do not see any issues utilizing dnf for normal package upgrades, and my I/O device seems to be OK
Apr 10 17:12:12 <JEEB>	I quickly searched and I didn't see anything relevant in search results for 31 to 32 yet.
Apr 10 17:14:20 <bhermon>	ok, it's working, many thanks.
Apr 10 17:14:25 <kwizart>	ledeni, nothing use compat-ffmpeg28 but spotify (for few features) nowadays
Apr 10 17:15:21 <JEEB>	ok, another attempt for this, let's see if I get any checksum failures... the fifth or so time in a row? and somehow always only with system upgrade
Apr 10 17:16:14 <ledeni>	kwizart, try to run https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIk7gwjgIM
Apr 10 17:16:49 <ledeni>	kwizart, without compat-ffmeg28
Apr 10 17:20:59 <JEEB>	:< http://up-cat.net/p/5bd6cf07
Apr 10 17:21:31 <JEEB>	why on earth would this only happen with dnf system-upgrade download and not with normal package updates
Apr 10 17:22:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, what command are you using
Apr 10 17:22:40 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32
Apr 10 17:22:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:23:15 <short-bike>	ANd what repo's have you enabled - I was under the impression f32 was still not GA ?
Apr 10 17:23:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	short-bike, thus the fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:23:48 <short-bike>	Gotcha Southern_Gentlem
Apr 10 17:23:54 <JEEB>	short-bike: yea I am upgrading to non-GA because it seems like freeze period is starting and the major blockers got closed with gnome session segfaulting etc
Apr 10 17:24:04 <JEEB>	(specifically the wayland compositor apparently crashing until now)
Apr 10 17:24:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:24:20 <JEEB>	yes, I was doing that
Apr 10 17:24:30 <JEEB>	just validating the paste link opens ok here
Apr 10 17:24:48 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/af6c19e7
Apr 10 17:24:50 <JEEB>	there you go
Apr 10 17:26:15 <JEEB>	should be pretty vanilla fc31 except I got used to enabling -testing because sometimes security updates took otherwise longer to get in
Apr 10 17:26:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	hmmm so why have you been playing in updates-testing
Apr 10 17:26:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	run your command again
Apr 10 17:27:05 <JEEB>	?
Apr 10 17:27:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	this time paste all including your command to paste.centos.org please
Apr 10 17:27:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32
Apr 10 17:27:42 <JEEB>	I can just post the two dnf.logs since those should have everything. the download and then the next reboot
Apr 10 17:27:49 <JEEB>	the download part succeeds as far as I can tell
Apr 10 17:27:55 <JEEB>	let me just post them
Apr 10 17:28:26 <JEEB>	and if you want me to downgrade everything to non-testing then if there's a quick command for that I can then do that
Apr 10 17:28:42 <JEEB>	although a lot of updates in testing just ends up in stable just a few days later
Apr 10 17:28:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well then what is this then http://up-cat.net/p/5bd6cf07
Apr 10 17:29:20 <JEEB>	that's a snippet from the post-reboot actual upgrade
Apr 10 17:29:25 <JEEB>	let me just post the log files
Apr 10 17:29:33 <JEEB>	I did think I noted that the download went seemingly OK
Apr 10 17:29:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	lets try the download again please
Apr 10 17:30:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am suspecting an out of date mirror
Apr 10 17:30:12 <JEEB>	ok, I will clear my caches and run it again if you don't want my older dnf.log from my previous run :)
Apr 10 17:30:26 <JEEB>	(although that was just a few minutes earlier)
Apr 10 17:30:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	the --refresh should clear your cache
Apr 10 17:30:41 <JEEB>	yes, I am always running that since I've had bad cases of updates not propagating
Apr 10 17:31:00 <JEEB>	anyways, clearing downloaded packages and retrying
Apr 10 17:31:17 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade clean and that one again
Apr 10 17:32:29 <JEEB>	I'll post the full stdout and stderr as it finishes
Apr 10 17:32:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	please include your command
Apr 10 17:33:04 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32 &> ~root/system-upgrade-download.log
Apr 10 17:33:45 <JEEB>	I don't think it logs it in the log, unless I bump verbosity, maybe? so if you are not trusting me to run what I say I run then we might have a problem
Apr 10 17:34:43 <JEEB>	I know that dnf recently got an upgrade with modules in -testing, so unless someone had an idea I'd probably try downgrading that to the previous one https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9
Apr 10 17:35:22 <short-bike>	Does --refresh clear out the downloaded meta-data - I though 'clean all' was the only arg that did that ?
Apr 10 17:35:36 <JEEB>	it at least always downloads new data
Apr 10 17:35:56 <JEEB>	you might need to clean all if you really want to get rid of all caches before that
Apr 10 17:36:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	man dnf
Apr 10 17:37:37 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: also btw if your hostility towards me that I'm perceiving here is due to there a separate channel for upgrades to not-yet-GA releases then I will just take the hint and move there if you can hint at a more proper venue.
Apr 10 17:38:09 <JEEB>	ok, the topic says F32 beta as well :P
Apr 10 17:38:41 <JEEB>	ok, it finished. uploading the stdout and stderr
Apr 10 17:38:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB,  i am not being hostile to you in anyway, i am sorry if you think i am
Apr 10 17:39:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	the man dnf was for short-bike
Apr 10 17:39:59 <JEEB>	ok, no problem then. my misreading then. I just read into the way my dnf log files etc weren't good enough, since they seem to be very similar to the stdout/stderr.
Apr 10 17:40:17 <JEEB>	now let me just get that stdout+err into a bin
Apr 10 17:40:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	i asked a question about updates-testing and you answered so i went on to something else
Apr 10 17:41:56 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: https://0x0.st/iSJE.log
Apr 10 17:42:18 <JEEB>	that's `dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32 &> ~root/system-upgrade-download.log`
Apr 10 17:42:26 <JEEB>	which did succeed previously as well
Apr 10 17:42:39 <JEEB>	the only failure came as I run the reboot into system upgrade
Apr 10 17:42:52 <JEEB>	when it started checking the packages downloaded, apparently
Apr 10 17:43:00 <JEEB>	for that you only have the dnf logs
Apr 10 17:43:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	try that now to see if you still get that same error
Apr 10 17:43:31 <JEEB>	roger that, although I'm not really hopeful :)
Apr 10 17:43:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	**crossing fingers**
Apr 10 17:44:41 <JEEB>	let's just say I did it the first time around 2AM today, and then one time with and one time without updates-testing enabled from 32 afterwards
Apr 10 17:44:44 <JEEB>	:)
Apr 10 17:44:47 <JEEB>	anyways, it started
Apr 10 17:45:43 <JEEB>	the new upgrade view which I think got enabled with 31 is pretty nice, although I did like the actual numbers X/Y
Apr 10 17:46:16 <JEEB>	ok, it rebooted at 0% so most likely another checksum error. I will post the dnf log from the system upgrade
Apr 10 17:46:56 <JEEB>	I have a hunch it might be the in-testing update to dnf and modules so I will attempt to downgrade to current updates
Apr 10 17:48:33 <JEEB>	anyways, back to normal desktop so posting hte log
Apr 10 17:49:47 <JEEB>	https://0x0.st/iSJk.log
Apr 10 17:50:08 <JEEB>	expected result, at this point
Apr 10 17:51:19 <JEEB>	apparently parts of the log ended up in dnf.log.1, so posting that as well. it has the download as well
Apr 10 17:51:31 <JEEB>	https://0x0.st/iSJn.1
Apr 10 17:52:31 <JEEB>	2020-04-10T16:44:10Z DDEBUG Extra commands: ['system-upgrade', 'reboot'] is where I initiated the reboot
Apr 10 17:52:43 <JEEB>	2020-04-10T16:45:06Z DDEBUG Extra commands: ['system-upgrade', 'upgrade']
Apr 10 17:52:53 <JEEB>	is where it booted into the system upgrade env
Apr 10 17:53:27 <JEEB>	also the dnf logs have the dnf version I'm currently running which is https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9 as noted
Apr 10 17:53:39 <JEEB>	I'll attempt to go back to stable update
Apr 10 17:53:48 <kwizart>	ledeni, I'm looking into this, because I have both ffmpeg and compat installed, but I still cannot play the stream (h264/adts/TS), so there is maybe another dependency involved
Apr 10 17:54:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb yes i see the issue but i cant tell if it was a mirror issue or a package issue
Apr 10 17:55:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	cat /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo |fpaste please
Apr 10 17:56:02 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/05dcaecf
Apr 10 17:56:09 <JEEB>	should be pretty vanilla, I think?
Apr 10 17:57:04 <JEEB>	I should also have teh cisco and the modular repos enabled
Apr 10 17:57:17 <JEEB>	I can just paste a grep of enabled based on the files in yum.repos.d
Apr 10 17:58:12 <mfilipe[m]>	hi folks! i'm running snap of skype but somehow it isn't communicating with pulseaudio. i have the same problem with slack. do you know how to enable pulseaudio in these apps in fedora?
Apr 10 17:58:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m],  contact the authors
Apr 10 17:58:46 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/e5f7e1ef
Apr 10 17:58:48 <JEEB>	there you go
Apr 10 17:59:00 <JEEB>	that's all the repos I have atm, and their enabled status
Apr 10 17:59:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb are you using anything from the modular repos
Apr 10 17:59:55 <JEEB>	that I think came up in the system upgrade, there were like four-five packages that for some reason got installed from modular
Apr 10 18:00:03 <JEEB>	like gimp, awk, meson and jinja
Apr 10 18:00:22 <JEEB>	I didn't specifically request them to get installed through there
Apr 10 18:00:42 <JEEB>	but the system upgrade seemed to correctly remove those if you look at the logs
Apr 10 18:00:48 <JEEB>	or well, decide to
Apr 10 18:00:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the old days the repo files had a baseurl link to the master mirror which has been removed
Apr 10 18:00:51 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: i do not have the same problem when i'm using ubuntu. i believe this is a problems between snapd and fedora, not a problem in the applications.
Apr 10 18:01:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	we dont use snap we use flatpak
Apr 10 18:01:48 *	cyberpear finds the baseurl removal annoying
Apr 10 18:02:01 <mfilipe[m]>	as far as i know fedora has a snapd package, so it uses snap as well
Apr 10 18:02:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb so my idea was to point your repos at the master mirror
Apr 10 18:02:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m],  dont mean we will support it here
Apr 10 18:02:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	if you think there is an error in the package please file a bugzilla
Apr 10 18:02:48 <mfilipe[m]>	why:
Apr 10 18:02:51 <mfilipe[m]>	 * why?
Apr 10 18:03:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	not many of us use it
Apr 10 18:03:07 <whatnow111>	hello. simple question. i was trying to open the app Transmission in the terminal by typing Transmission, but it didn't work. anyone know why?
Apr 10 18:03:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	at all
Apr 10 18:03:24 <mfilipe[m]>	i will try to find a way to debug this
Apr 10 18:03:42 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: so replace the baseurl with some specific mirror's baseurl?
Apr 10 18:03:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111,  rpm -qa |grep transmission  compare with dnf search transmission
Apr 10 18:04:15 <whatnow111>	i have the app already.
Apr 10 18:04:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb yep if we know that mirror is updated
Apr 10 18:04:37 <JEEB>	but this anyways is really weird
Apr 10 18:04:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	since we are seeing different packages with the same error to me its out of date mirrors
Apr 10 18:04:50 <whatnow111>	southern, ok. i will try.
Apr 10 18:04:57 <JEEB>	since it clearly downloads and is OK with the result?
Apr 10 18:05:37 <JEEB>	anyways, let me first try downgrading the packages from https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9 to stable updates
Apr 10 18:05:49 <JEEB>	dnf plugins and libdnf/-repo etc
Apr 10 18:05:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB,  besides that i will have to point you at the #fedora-qa to see if they have anyother ideas
Apr 10 18:06:12 <JEEB>	yeh
Apr 10 18:06:37 <JEEB>	it seems very weird and opaque, you'd think it would do the check after download as well, and if it does then that one passes
Apr 10 18:07:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so what is the result of rpm -qa |grep transmission
Apr 10 18:07:55 <JEEB>	but fedora has had a pretty good track record for me until now :D https://paste.centos.org/view/6f1afa81
Apr 10 18:07:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so what is the result of rpm -qa |grep transmission |fpaste
Apr 10 18:08:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, yeah at this point its over my head so #fedora-qa
Apr 10 18:08:53 <JEEB>	roger that
Apr 10 18:09:37 <whatnow111>	southern, actually, i'm using manjaro now. i thought it should work with all distros.  i think most people in manjaro channel are taking a nap so i just came here.
Apr 10 18:10:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, then why should i not ban you is the next question
Apr 10 18:10:38 <whatnow111>	southern, i use fedora too.
Apr 10 18:10:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	but you are not in fedora asking the question now are you
Apr 10 18:11:03 <whatnow111>	i dual boot on this computer.
Apr 10 18:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	so
Apr 10 18:11:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	the rpm command is think should work on both distros
Apr 10 18:11:58 <whatnow111>	ok. let me try.
Apr 10 18:12:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	and you didnt ever try
Apr 10 18:13:16 <whatnow111>	hmm. rpm doesn't work.
Apr 10 18:13:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	what package manager does manjaro use
Apr 10 18:13:56 <whatnow111>	pacman
Apr 10 18:14:07 <Khaytsus>	You're asking about a problem in manjaro in #fedora ?
Apr 10 18:14:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes he is
Apr 10 18:14:23 *	Khaytsus blinks
Apr 10 18:15:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, in your terminal if you type transmission and press tab what happens
Apr 10 18:17:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, https://paste.centos.org/view/6eea00db
Apr 10 18:23:19 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], i just install skype with snap and is working ok here
Apr 10 18:23:46 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: did you test your mic and webcam?
Apr 10 18:24:09 <mfilipe[m]>	they aren't communicating with pulseaudio here
Apr 10 18:24:10 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], yes just did it
Apr 10 18:24:24 <mfilipe[m]>	sounds like they are trying to communicate directly with alsa
Apr 10 18:24:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m], sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 18:24:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	ledeni,  you as well please
Apr 10 18:26:12 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/5d0637e8
Apr 10 18:27:17 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: do you use a p2, usb or bluetooth headset?
Apr 10 18:28:01 <ledeni>	Southern_Gentlem, https://paste.centos.org/view/8a459e60
Apr 10 18:29:10 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], no just mic from laptop and integreted cam
Apr 10 18:30:08 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], how you install snap
Apr 10 18:30:24 <mfilipe[m]>	i checked the configs in flatpak and snap... flatpak gets the sound channels from pulseaudio properly but the snap package gets the audio cards from alsa
Apr 10 18:30:54 <whatnow111>	southern, it worked. thanks.
Apr 10 18:30:59 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: dnf install snapd && snap install skype
Apr 10 18:31:40 <mfilipe[m]>	actually i installed the snap package through the snap store
Apr 10 18:33:48 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], did you make syslink 'sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap'
Apr 10 18:34:30 <mfilipe[m]>	yep: lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root      19 out 15 17:41 snap -> /var/lib/snapd/snap
Apr 10 18:37:31 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], when you run 'alsamixer' what is card
Apr 10 18:37:40 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: thank you very much for installing the packages to help me to troubleshooting this :)
Apr 10 18:37:45 <mfilipe[m]>	i see in your pastebin :)
Apr 10 18:38:20 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: it says PulseAudio
Apr 10 18:39:50 <mfilipe[m]>	i really believe this is a problem between snapd and fedora, and not a problem in the applications
Apr 10 18:40:32 <mfilipe[m]>	unfortunately i don't know how to dig more to report a bug to fedora yet :(
Apr 10 18:40:41 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], lol i just install skype and it is working
Apr 10 18:41:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	no you installed snap from outside of the repo
Apr 10 18:41:30 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: really? oh shit, let me see
Apr 10 18:41:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	ledeni, installed from inside and its working so go remove the snap you installed and install the one from the fedora repo
Apr 10 18:42:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	<mfilipe[m]> actually i installed the snap package through the snap store
Apr 10 18:43:22 <mfilipe[m]>	that's odd... how could i install snapd outside of the fedora repo? hahaha
Apr 10 18:44:51 <mfilipe[m]>	https://paste.centos.org/view/9539e866
Apr 10 18:44:55 <mfilipe[m]>	it is installed from the fedora repo
Apr 10 18:45:56 <mfilipe[m]>	or maybe I didn't get the point of your question Southern_Gentlem
Apr 10 18:46:32 <mfilipe[m]>	fedora had removed the snap plugin from gnome-software (to be honest, an ego decision in my opinion)
Apr 10 18:47:10 <mfilipe[m]>	so i need the snap store to install the packages or install using the snap commandline
Apr 10 18:50:37 <mfilipe[m]>	let me try install through the skype snap using the commandline
Apr 10 18:56:53 <mfilipe[m]>	same problem
Apr 10 18:58:33 <mfilipe[m]>	but i found out a new stuff here... skype works when i use the mic (sux) and the speaker of my laptop
Apr 10 19:00:25 <mfilipe[m]>	if i move the input/output channel in pulseaudio, it didn't work... actually skype didn't change, it keeps using my sound card rather than the pulseaudio channels
Apr 10 19:00:26 <mfilipe[m]>	lol
Apr 10 19:00:43 <mfilipe[m]>	and the skype config shows the alsa cards and not the pulseaudio channels
Apr 10 19:01:09 <mixfix411>	your fedora is a usb edition?
Apr 10 19:01:32 <mfilipe[m]>	fedora 31 workstation running in ssd
Apr 10 19:02:26 <mixfix411>	your lsblk has all those loop devices howd you get taht
Apr 10 19:02:44 <mixfix411>	my normal fedora workstation only works with the traditional partition scheme
Apr 10 19:03:28 <mfilipe[m]>	mixfix411: snapd creates those loop devices (squashfs) for each application that i install
Apr 10 19:07:27 <mixfix411>	oh i see its a snap stuff
Apr 10 19:07:40 <mixfix411>	that's pretty cool
Apr 10 19:08:28 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], do you have install 'pavucontrol'
Apr 10 19:08:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so did you get figued out
Apr 10 19:08:59 <whatnow111>	southern, it worked.
Apr 10 19:09:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	what was the issue
Apr 10 19:09:40 <whatnow111>	but i doesn't seem to work with all programs.
Apr 10 19:10:31 <whatnow111>	well, the key is transmission itself is incomplete. you need to type -gtk with it.
Apr 10 19:10:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes

Apr 10 19:20:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	well why do you think that doesnt work
Apr 10 19:21:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program no the type
Apr 10 19:21:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program no the type of program
Apr 10 19:21:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	vi nano pluma etc
Apr 10 19:21:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program not the type of program
Apr 10 19:22:54 <whatnow111>	i think it is the name of the program in manjaro. sorry to upset you. when i scrolled the mouse at the favorite bar on the left side of the screen, one of the apps there is called Text Editor.
Apr 10 19:23:48 <whatnow111>	let me reboot to fedora.
Apr 10 19:32:42 <whatnow111>	ok. officially using fedora.
Apr 10 19:33:14 <specing>	what now?
Apr 10 19:33:16 <whatnow111>	southern, text editor is the name of a program, no?
Apr 10 19:34:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	no thats a type of program
Apr 10 19:34:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf search "text editor"
Apr 10 19:34:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, what Desktop Environment are you using
Apr 10 19:35:05 <whatnow111>	gnome
Apr 10 19:36:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	the menus can say whatever it can be a type or the program name
Apr 10 19:36:40 <whatnow111>	ah, it's gedit in disguise.
Apr 10 19:36:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	bingo
Apr 10 19:38:21 <whatnow111>	but if you click show applications, it's not named as such.
Apr 10 19:39:16 <Khaytsus>	If you type "gedit" into gnome's search it doesn't come up?
Apr 10 19:40:07 <whatnow111>	nope.
Apr 10 19:40:08 <Khaytsus>	and had you done the smae with transmission, pretty sure it would have shown up in the menus....
Apr 10 19:40:11 <Khaytsus>	#doubt
Apr 10 19:40:14 *	Khaytsus installs Workstation
Apr 10 19:40:33 <whatnow111>	i can send you screenshot
Apr 10 19:40:40 <Khaytsus>	No thanks
Apr 10 19:40:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well the command is transmission-gtk but the menus show transmission
Apr 10 19:41:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, always remember the true power of the OS is in the commandline
Apr 10 19:42:38 <whatnow111>	southern, yes, it's very useful if you know how to harness it.
Apr 10 19:43:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111,  time in the seat you will learn
Apr 10 19:44:25 <Khaytsus>	whatnow111: If you type gedit in gnome, it comes up.  Period.
Apr 10 19:44:25 <whatnow111>	very cool. i've used it to reboot the computer and shut it down. i'm sure it can do much more.
Apr 10 19:45:14 <whatnow111>	khay, in the show applications area?
Apr 10 19:45:23 <Khaytsus>	...
Apr 10 19:45:34 <Khaytsus>	You click whatever at the top, type gedit, it comes up.
Apr 10 19:45:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	press f2
Apr 10 19:46:13 <Khaytsus>	"Activities" is what the text is, apparently...  had to look
Apr 10 19:46:31 <whatnow111>	ok. i searched gedit, but the app showing is text editor.
Apr 10 19:46:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	you type gedit and text editor appears
Apr 10 19:46:43 <Khaytsus>	good lord
Apr 10 19:47:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	which we already know it is correct
Apr 10 19:48:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the box you type "text" text editor and libreoffice-writer come up
Apr 10 19:49:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, why doesnt vim come up
Apr 10 19:49:46 <whatnow111>	it's part of the terminal?
Apr 10 19:50:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	close its a tui program not a gui program
Apr 10 19:50:55 <whatnow111>	ok. so tui programs are invisible from search.
Apr 10 19:50:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	terminal user interface vs graphics user interface
Apr 10 19:51:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 10 19:51:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	that application search yes
Apr 10 19:51:27 <whatnow111>	southern, how about hexchat? it didn't work.
Apr 10 19:51:38 <whatnow111>	from terminal.
Apr 10 19:53:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	does for me
Apr 10 19:54:05 <whatnow111>	did you have to quit hexchat first?
Apr 10 19:54:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Apr 10 19:54:35 <whatnow111>	ok. so you can't launch the app twice?
Apr 10 19:54:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	some apps you can, some you cant
Apr 10 19:56:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	and i advise to use hexchat && so it releases your terminal
Apr 10 19:57:47 <Khaytsus>	Or just run it in the gui, since it's a gui app..........
Apr 10 19:58:04 <whatnow111>	ah i see. that's what && is for? so that detaches the app from terminal once it's launched?
Apr 10 19:58:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	google
Apr 10 19:59:33 <Khaytsus>	Just & is sufficient btw..  && means if this command succeeds, run the next
Apr 10 20:00:53 <whatnow111>	ok. thanks for the lesson today. i appreciate it. good bye for now.
Apr 10 20:12:24 <mfilipe[m]>	basically fedora doesn't care about snapd: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=snapd&product=Fedora
Apr 10 20:12:27 <mfilipe[m]>	lol
Apr 10 20:12:54 <Khaytsus>	snap and flatpack are both utterly useless imo
Apr 10 20:14:23 <mfilipe[m]>	for me they are a revolution for the software vendors which want to offer support to linux
Apr 10 20:15:00 <Khaytsus>	Except they aren't in any way standalone..  they still depend on base libraries.  And if you don't have those libraries it won't work.
Apr 10 20:15:07 <Khaytsus>	So pointless.
Apr 10 20:16:04 <mfilipe[m]>	they are containers but for applications
Apr 10 20:16:15 <mfilipe[m]>	i love the container concept
Apr 10 20:16:38 <mfilipe[m]>	flatpak/snap are the docker for applications
Apr 10 20:16:58 <specing>	mfilipe[m]: they are just another distro
Apr 10 20:17:05 <specing>	you are putting a distro on top of your distro
Apr 10 20:17:10 <specing>	because you like distros
Apr 10 20:17:21 <specing>	and proprietary software vendors know that
Apr 10 20:18:03 <mfilipe[m]>	what is the problem about that? when you isolate an application, you improve security, build and install
Apr 10 20:18:21 <specing>	snap and flatpak aren't VMs
Apr 10 20:18:58 <mfilipe[m]>	exactly
Apr 10 20:19:51 <mfilipe[m]>	the unique problem that i see in the container concept is the storage
Apr 10 20:19:59 <mfilipe[m]>	naturally they consome more
Apr 10 20:20:02 <mfilipe[m]>	BUT
Apr 10 20:20:20 <mfilipe[m]>	storage is the cheapest hardware resource these days
Apr 10 20:20:44 <specing>	They aren't as secure as VMs
Apr 10 20:21:39 <mfilipe[m]>	specing: actually it is the same imo
Apr 10 20:21:52 <specing>	not even close
Apr 10 20:22:02 <jesse1010>	if I use a virtual connection in KVM through a 10gbe connection, will there be performance penalties vs pci passthrough of a 10gb nic?
Apr 10 20:22:07 <mfilipe[m]>	if you run a vm with privileged in the host, it won't be secure for your host
Apr 10 20:22:10 <specing>	I don't trust containers with security, too much code is involved for that
Apr 10 20:22:10 <jesse1010>	how much of one if so
Apr 10 20:22:47 <mfilipe[m]>	the same for flatpak/snap... if the dev doesn't configure the container in an isolate mode, it won't be secure for the host
Apr 10 20:23:19 <specing>	I'm telling you that it won't be secure even if you configure it in "isolate mode", whatever that is
Apr 10 20:25:13 <mfilipe[m]>	isolate mode means that the services inside of the container can't communicate with the host, except through proxies
Apr 10 20:27:32 <specing>	mfilipe[m]: and what would those proxies be?
Apr 10 20:27:53 <specing>	It's shared kernel. They can't do anything without talking to the host
Apr 10 20:28:44 <mfilipe[m]>	snap/flatpak, for example, you can communicate with wayland if your application uses the wayland proxy
Apr 10 20:29:10 <mfilipe[m]>	but they can't communicate directly, except if they aren't running in an isolate mode
Apr 10 20:29:54 <specing>	Great, so these proxies increase attack surface even more than using plain lxc with vnc?
Apr 10 20:29:56 <specing>	What a great idea
Apr 10 20:30:48 <mfilipe[m]>	i don't know what you mean by attack surface
Apr 10 20:30:55 <mfilipe[m]>	in this context
Apr 10 20:31:08 <specing>	As you said, storage is cheap these days and thus ther is nothing to be lost by going the VM route
Apr 10 20:32:58 <mfilipe[m]>	probably not but it's much easier to run a distro using docker than a vm
Apr 10 20:33:11 <mfilipe[m]>	$ docker run -it distro-name bash
Apr 10 20:33:35 <mfilipe[m]>	$ configure vm && start vm && connect to vm
Apr 10 20:34:19 <specing>	I rather put in some more work up-front than deal with the fallout of a security breach later on
Apr 10 20:34:49 <specing>	Fedora has an automated installer, which I'm learning to use right now (kickstart files)
Apr 10 20:35:15 <specing>	thus creating VMs should be as simple as creating containers, once the kickstart file is written
Apr 10 20:35:42 <dowdle>	specing: There is also virt-builder.
Apr 10 20:36:00 <plundra>	Cloud images \o/
Apr 10 20:36:34 <plundra>	Haven't tried with Fedora yet, but with Ubuntu I booted, inited, rebooted within <20 seconds.
Apr 10 20:36:35 <mfilipe[m]>	i don't know which kind of security you are trying to achieve but docker is already very well tested in the market  to have these "security breaches" that you are talking about
Apr 10 20:36:48 <specing>	is it?
Apr 10 20:37:07 <specing>	I'm yet to see bigger hosting companies offer LXC/Docker virtualisation and they actually have paid security experts on staff
Apr 10 20:37:09 <mfilipe[m]>	is it not?
Apr 10 20:38:08 <mfilipe[m]>	anyway, vm and docker are different concepts
Apr 10 20:38:12 <mfilipe[m]>	you can use both, depends of the problem you have to solve
Apr 10 20:40:58 <Pie-jacker875>	new firefox changes suck balls, how should I go about reverting? install old package?
Apr 10 20:41:17 <Pie-jacker875>	find changes and recompile without them?
Apr 10 20:42:18 <dowdle>	Pie-jacker875: You talking about in Firefox 75?
Apr 10 20:42:23 <Pie-jacker875>	yeah
Apr 10 20:42:36 <Pie-jacker875>	I don't want single click on address bar to highlight the whole thing
Apr 10 20:42:59 <Pie-jacker875>	it's a pointless change in behavior as far as I'm concerned and it's annoying
Apr 10 20:44:06 <mfilipe[m]>	Pie-jacker875: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/266888/can-i-force-dnf-to-install-an-old-version-of-a-package
Apr 10 20:44:26 <mfilipe[m]>	use the reference there to firefox-74
Apr 10 20:44:36 <specing>	Pie-jacker875: it's probably burried in about:config
Apr 10 20:44:55 <Pie-jacker875>	specing: I've spent several minutes looking for it, as well as reading through the reddit thread of people complaining
Apr 10 20:45:06 <Pie-jacker875>	seems like they've removed the option for it in about:config
Apr 10 20:45:28 <specing>	if you want to really fix firefox, youhave to revert to before webextensions :)
Apr 10 20:45:43 <mfilipe[m]>	Pie-jacker875: probably in #fx-desktop-community:mozilla.org they can help you to configure the new version to work the way you expect
Apr 10 20:46:05 <Pie-jacker875>	is that a matrix channel?
Apr 10 20:46:11 <mfilipe[m]>	yep
Apr 10 20:46:15 <Pie-jacker875>	cool, heading there no
Apr 10 20:46:16 <Pie-jacker875>	now
Apr 10 21:22:16 <srbaker>	Heya folks. For some reason I can't join #fedora-cloud from polari, so I'll just ask here: is there a non-standard username in the AWS images for Fedora Server?
Apr 10 21:22:25 <srbaker>	I'm getting permission denied when I try to ssh as root@ per AWS' instructions
Apr 10 21:23:46 <mfilipe[m]>	did you try ec2-user?
Apr 10 21:24:04 <mfilipe[m]>	probably it's better to ask this in ##aws
Apr 10 21:25:06 <srbaker>	I've tried root, admin (which is what it is on debian images), ec2-user, and fedora because I ran out of ideas.
Apr 10 21:25:41 <bugs_>	i think aws provides you with a key to use so you ssh -i key host
Apr 10 21:25:53 <srbaker>	Yes, I am using that key.
Apr 10 21:26:12 <mfilipe[m]>	but he doesn't know which user to use
Apr 10 21:26:30 <bugs_>	ssh -i ec2-one.pem ec2-user@host
Apr 10 21:26:57 <srbaker>	Yes. That does not work. That's why I'm here.
Apr 10 21:31:53 <bugs_>	srbaker:  two more things to check that i can think of
Apr 10 21:32:45 <bugs_>	chmod 600 keyfile - in case the permissions are dangerous
Apr 10 21:32:56 <bugs_>	and second if you downloaded the key file with windows it may need dos2unix
Apr 10 21:33:01 <srbaker>	Got it, thanks. It's fedora.
Apr 10 21:33:07 <srbaker>	I typo'd when I tried fedora.
Apr 10 21:33:09 <srbaker>	Thanks
Apr 10 21:33:38 <Khaytsus>	I wish they'd just stick to ec2-user
Apr 10 21:46:42 <whatnow111>	hello. can someone help me with video card issue? it's not a big one. the problem is after the computer wakes up, the screen looked washed up with purplish tint.
Apr 10 22:00:38 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, I prefer cloud-user - not AWS specific ec2-user
Apr 10 22:00:51 <plarsen>	But I would like consistency too

Apr 11 00:08:28 <Egyptian>	hey there - is it safe to disable and/or uninstall dnsmasq on my laptop? i didnt install it
Apr 11 00:10:08 <Sokel>	it's likely safe to remove.
Apr 11 00:13:48 <Khaytsus>	It's default and used by default, but sure, do whatever you like to your own system.  Just don't ask us when dns resolution doens't work, it'll be on you ;)
Apr 11 00:14:17 <Egyptian>	Khaytsus: its a dhcp and dns server .. however .. is some other software using it?
Apr 11 00:14:35 <Khaytsus>	...  "it is used by default"
Apr 11 00:15:27 <Egyptian>	default ? used by what ? trying to figure things out .. i wan to install a dns server and i saw the port being used
Apr 11 00:16:05 <wwalker>	Egyptian: could be installed by a virtual machine/container application.  Why do you want to remove it?  Is it causing a problem?
Apr 11 00:16:21 <Egyptian>	i want to replace it with nxfilter
Apr 11 00:26:56 <wwalker>	Egyptian: systemctl status dnsmasq   is it running?  On my machines, it is installed but not running
Apr 11 00:28:14 <Egyptian>	hmm.. research shows that i can have dnsmasq point to a different dns server - will give that a try .. thank you
Apr 11 00:28:24 <Egyptian>	wwalker: yes its running
Apr 11 00:28:54 <wwalker>	does it show enabled?
Apr 11 00:29:02 <Egyptian>	and yes i have a huge list of dependencies like virt* and cockpit  and their dependencies
Apr 11 00:29:08 <Egyptian>	yes its enabled
Apr 11 00:30:39 <wwalker>	look in /etc/dnsmasq.d  if there are files there then see what installed them :  rpm -qf /etc/dnsmasq.d/foo.conf
Apr 11 00:31:09 <wwalker>	oh, missed your dependencies post
Apr 11 00:32:43 <wwalker>	Egyptian: are you using virtual machines or cockpit
Apr 11 00:33:37 <cantstanya>	if you're using libvirt with the default bridge interface that will use dnsmasq.
Apr 11 00:34:09 <cantstanya>	but it shouldn't overlap you using another dns cache/server if you plan accordingly.
Apr 11 00:34:26 <daniel-wtd>	Egyptian: you can find out which installed packages is a dependency from another installed package via "rpm -q --whatrequires package_name". For dnsmasq, at least podman-plugins and afaik some libvirt is depending on dnsmasq.
Apr 11 00:35:37 <cantstanya>	also, iirc, libvirt doesn't use dnsmasq as a systemd service, it executes the program and monitors the process on its own.
Apr 11 00:36:30 <daniel-wtd>	same for podman afaik
Apr 11 00:37:01 <cantstanya>	and it's bound to the private network gateway address, so it REALLY shouldn't interfere with anything unless you don't plan accordingly.
Apr 11 00:37:16 <cantstanya>	in libvirt's case iirc the default is 192.168.122.1
Apr 11 00:37:51 <cantstanya>	if you use something else expecting it to listen on all interfaces, well that was an error in planning.
Apr 11 00:55:57 <Egyptian>	i am using both cockipt and libvirt as well as docker - this machine is like my home server where i throw everythign on it .. i guess its began to complain :rofl:
Apr 11 00:58:06 <guiekguiek>	Has anyone had issues with conflicting packages for virtualbox when upgrading to fedora 32?
Apr 11 01:00:40 <Sokel>	How and where did you install virtualbox from?
Apr 11 01:02:15 <guiekguiek>	using virtualbox's repo from their website

Apr 11 09:10:55 <ledeni>	indr, once you remove kernel did you update grub via 'grub2-mkconfig'
Apr 11 09:12:46 <indr>	Oh right. Three options show up there
Apr 11 09:13:22 <indr>	I thought when I dnf update my system that grub2-mkconfig command would be called and hence my grub config updated accordingly
Apr 11 09:14:17 <ledeni>	indr, how many kernel show 'rpm -qa kernel'
Apr 11 09:14:28 <indr>	Three
Apr 11 09:15:40 <ledeni>	indr,ok witch system you have uefi of bios
Apr 11 09:15:48 <indr>	uefi
Apr 11 09:16:07 <indr>	I think (I'm sorry)
Apr 11 09:16:40 <indr>	Btw thank you very much for helping me!
Apr 11 09:18:34 <ledeni>	indr, uefi --> run 'grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg' bios --> run 'grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg'
Apr 11 09:18:59 <indr>	Great. Thank you
Apr 11 09:19:17 <indr>	What are /etc/grub/grub2.cfg and /etc/grub/grub2-efi.cfg files for?
Apr 11 09:26:37 <ledeni>	indr, best check with 'google'
Apr 11 09:42:26 <indr>	ledeni, allright, just sym links, thank you very much!
Apr 11 09:43:11 <indr>	What scares me about these cfg files is that the newly generate files are significantly different from the old ones?
Apr 11 09:52:02 <indr>	I'm not doing anything here, lol
Apr 11 10:40:03 <sincorchetes>	Morning
Apr 11 10:53:14 <drOdo>	hi
Apr 11 10:53:30 <drOdo>	cannot boot fedora 31 after today update
Apr 11 10:54:10 <drOdo>	"System BootOrder not found. Initializing defaults."
Apr 11 10:55:04 <drOdo>	anyone can help pls?
Apr 11 11:12:17 <drOdo>	exactly as this https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/askfedora/original/2X/f/f8f58d9127f510fd04186c6ee98e7e143f53c715.jpeg
Apr 11 11:42:43 <drOdo>	i have managed to manually boot from \EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi
Apr 11 11:43:30 <drOdo>	dnf history info on last upgrade shows some errors for package grub2
Apr 11 12:08:57 <drOdo>	ok, posted the bug to bugzilla
Apr 11 13:53:42 <miscing>	Hi, anyone have idea of a package that depends on a lot of the kf5 utilities? I've looked at what they all depend on all but dnf only answers each other, and I can't figure out why they're installed on my system given that I don't have plasma. I also checked the groups installed and don't see groups that would install them
Apr 11 13:54:31 <miscing>	I ran 'dnf repoquery --whatdepends $package' on each of the kf5 packages

Apr 11 14:11:59 <jgjorgji>	anyone have an idea why gnome-desktop3 is pulled in when i'm upgrading the kde spin f31-f32 ?
Apr 11 14:16:50 <M_aD>	jgjorgji: #fedora-kde is the official spin support channel, maybe they can help you there
Apr 11 14:21:12 <miscing>	quick question, what's the rpmfusion-*-source repositories for?
Apr 11 14:23:53 <Khaytsus>	miscing: the source rpms, just like every other repo
Apr 11 14:26:08 <miscing>	khaytsus: Why are the source repos disabled by default? Also pardon my ignorance but what's the difference between source rpm's and say the 'fedora' repo rpm's?
Apr 11 14:31:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing,  you build the rpm from the srpms you dont need them unless you are going to do a custom build of a package
Apr 11 14:32:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing,  do you really want the extra 500G of space taken up on your machine for nothing ?
Apr 11 14:34:16 <miscing>	Southern_Gentlem: thanks, is there somewhere a description of repositories and what they're for? best I found was https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/repositories/ and it's not very useful. For example i'm also wondering about the modular repo
Apr 11 14:34:21 <Khaytsus>	miscing: fedora's source rpm repos are also disabled by default
Apr 11 14:34:41 <Khaytsus>	https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/
Apr 11 14:35:14 <miscing>	Khaytsus thanks!
Apr 11 14:35:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing, a repopository of software
Apr 11 14:36:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	i advise staying away from modulars for now
Apr 11 14:36:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	i disable the modules and modules-updates repos on my machines
Apr 11 14:37:00 <Khaytsus>	Well, modular lets you install different versions of software at once.  Not something most users need
Apr 11 14:38:03 <miscing>	aight thanks that cleared it all up. I'll disable them, but good to know for future use
Apr 11 14:42:51 <mpduty>	#chair
Apr 11 15:06:54 <akdev>	question: why does DNF/YUM check for UID==0 ? I want to use it to build container images like `yum install --installroot=/home/me/images/mycontainer --releasever=/ install httpd` but it won't work as non-root
Apr 11 15:07:37 <kb1000>	you can probably disable that, check its docs
Apr 11 15:09:18 <akdev>	I've looked but found nothing
Apr 11 15:09:54 <akdev>	the source code suggests it cannot be disabled: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/blob/master/dnf/cli/commands/install.py#L64
Apr 11 15:10:28 <akdev>	I'm trying to build dnf to see if I can patch it out but the instructions in the README don't work for me either...
Apr 11 15:12:02 <kb1000>	what was the exact error message it prints then again? I don't currently have my fedora machine running
Apr 11 15:12:36 <akdev>	Error: This command has to be run with superuser privileges (under the root user on most systems).
Apr 11 15:18:09 <kb1000>	you should request that feature then if you need it
Apr 11 15:20:45 <akdev>	I'd rather implement it myself and send a PR, if I could figure out how to build DNF
Apr 11 15:31:16 <jidar>	what would be the reason that my password prompt takes almost a minute to load after typing in my user?
Apr 11 15:31:24 <jidar>	I checked nssswitch.conf, looks fine
Apr 11 15:33:50 <kb1000>	akdev: what of the build doesn't work for you then?
Apr 11 15:45:05 <akdev>	kb1000, installing dependencies
Apr 11 15:45:37 <akdev>	the latest commit on the master branch requires a newer version of python3-libdnf than what is available in F31
Apr 11 15:45:49 <akdev>	going back to the release that my system is using works
Apr 11 15:46:23 <akdev>	I was going to try a rawhide container next but I have somehow broken podman
Apr 11 15:47:10 <kb1000>	well...
Apr 11 15:51:55 <akdev>	rootless podman is finicky... rawhide container works
Apr 11 16:11:16 <Khaytsus>	akdev: rootless podman is finicky how?
Apr 11 16:12:42 <kb1000>	hmm
Apr 11 16:23:44 <Khaytsus>	Hmm, Plex seems to work in podman on F31 now, it didn't before although don't recall what the failure was
Apr 11 16:24:09 <nocnoc>	0/ test-images are signed for secur boot?
Apr 11 16:35:53 <akdev>	Khaytsus, it requires setting up the /etc/suduid and /etc/subgid correctly so I can have write access into my user files
Apr 11 16:36:09 <akdev>	can't do podman-in-podman yet
Apr 11 16:36:30 <Khaytsus>	akdev: Sure, but that happens automatically since like F29.  If your system was upgraded from there you would just have to edit the files yourself.
Apr 11 16:36:36 <Khaytsus>	No idea about nesting podman.
Apr 11 16:37:01 <akdev>	my system was a clean F31, I don't think it happened automatically
Apr 11 16:37:49 <akdev>	I mean it would work by default but it would map my root user in the container to some UID in a high range
Apr 11 16:38:37 <akdev>	so I couldn't just do `podman -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD fedora:latest` and have it work
Apr 11 16:39:12 <Khaytsus>	k..   tbh I have no idea how the mapping works, but I know on new installs it will map all new users (and any added later) with like user:1000000:65536
Apr 11 16:39:28 <Khaytsus>	Try the :Z flag for volumes?  Sure it wasn't just selinux?
Apr 11 16:39:34 <Khaytsus>	I had to add :Z to all of my volumes
Apr 11 16:41:13 <akdev>	I don't think it was SELinux, I was running in permissive mode and I did add an selinux fcontext rule to add the files and relabeled properly before enabling enforcing mode
Apr 11 16:41:23 <akdev>	now I hit this:   Error processing tar file(exit status 1): there might not be enough IDs available in the namespace (requested 192:192 for /run/systemd/netif): lchown /run/systemd/netif: invalid argument
Apr 11 16:42:27 <akdev>	no clue what that's about, I think I broke it when playing with /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, I repaired the files but the error still happens
Apr 11 16:42:30 *	akdev shrugs
Apr 11 16:48:29 <akdev>	reboot fixed it
Apr 11 18:06:52 <mr_johnson22[m]>	hi, does anyone know which flatpak apps (if any) use the webcam portal? as opposed to full /dev/ access?
Apr 11 18:13:49 <kk4ewt>	mr_johnson22[m]; sorry i dont use flatpaks period
Apr 11 18:25:33 <openface>	As per the planned schedule, the final production version of Fedora 32 is scheduled for release on April 21, 2020
Apr 11 18:25:46 <openface>	i am with 31
Apr 11 18:26:44 <openface>	maybe will be terrible idea to upgrade it from console or auto-update by graphical UI becouse will be fail like many things/versions to this time of meaning
Apr 11 18:27:07 <openface>	so all data gone if you want to upgrade by one-to-one
Apr 11 18:27:13 <openface>	:{}
Apr 11 18:27:33 <openface>	:'((
Apr 11 18:35:42 <mr_johnson22[m]>	is there a problem with f31/32 in particular that would make upgrading a bad idea? or is that just a general comment about distro updates :P
Apr 11 18:43:08 <linuxmodder>	mr_johnson22[m], to my knowledge the all use /dev/XXX
Apr 11 18:43:36 <linuxmodder>	is there a need for not using cheese   or similar as packaged in fedora repos
Apr 11 18:44:28 <kk4ewt>	linuxmodder; only one reason for flatpak is skype
Apr 11 18:44:59 <linuxmodder>	skype should burn a fiery death imo but okay I'll agree there
Apr 11 18:45:22 <mr_johnson22[m]>	linuxmodder, i'm just curious is all. Writing a report on android security and i'd like to compare how android & flatpak handle dynamic camera access
Apr 11 18:45:27 <kk4ewt>	openface;  yes you can upgrade now (recommended is the commandline method) and you will be on f32 when it releases (i think that is your question)
Apr 11 18:46:58 <linuxmodder>	mr_johnson22[m], major differnces and I'd even argue not worth a peaches to oranges comparision mobile linux (android/ios) is a whole different animal
Apr 11 18:47:44 <sdgathman>	Why is testing in a VM helpful for test day?  Wouldn't all VMs be the same, and covered by automated regression testing?
Apr 11 18:48:02 <sdgathman>	Obviously, testing on a variety of weird hardware is needed.
Apr 11 18:48:07 <mr_johnson22[m]>	linuxmodder, alright, thanks
Apr 11 18:48:41 <linuxmodder>	not really sdgathman  some have compat issues and configurations
Apr 11 18:48:54 <kk4ewt>	sdgathman; as in #fedora-qa
Apr 11 18:53:45 <pefi>	[Fedora 31,] I have problem with jami (https://jami.net, it's not in fedora repos yet) showing some unexpected error on my laptop. I did a test in virtual machine - jami works fine. So I need to verify my main system. rpm -Va doesn't show anything interesting )ot I don't understand it). The error is related to Qt - is there a way of veryfying that Qt installation is OK or even better resetting all Qt setting to defult values?
Apr 11 18:56:52 <kk4ewt>	pefi;  sorry i am not installing that to help you troubleshoot
Apr 11 18:57:11 <kk4ewt>	first thing i would try is creating a new user and test in that
Apr 11 18:57:51 <kk4ewt>	it will never be in the fedora repos becasue they have hard coded the codecs which are not allowed in fedora
Apr 11 18:58:37 <Gestra_>	spelling out that "some unexpect error" would probably help in solving the problem
Apr 11 18:58:54 <pefi>	kk4ewt, thanks :-) I tested new user - didn't fly. I did local build - no go, I checked the code - looks like Qt wants to show an error and complains about fonts.
Apr 11 18:59:46 <kk4ewt>	#fedora-kde might can help
Apr 11 18:59:49 <pefi>	Gestra_, thanks for interes :-) [SIGABRT] QFontDatabase: Must construct a QGuiApplication before accessing QFontDatabase.  full report here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-lrc/issues/428
Apr 11 18:59:53 <linuxmodder>	pefi,  uses hardcoded codecs as kk4ewt  stated already better luck asking in that dev groups irc channel

Apr 11 19:01:20 <linuxmodder>	ah thought that sounded familiar that broke in the 28/29 cycle and the old maintainer (in copr iirc )  ran from it like the black plague
Apr 11 19:01:25 <linuxmodder>	pefi, ^
Apr 11 19:01:38 <linuxmodder>	might try the snapd or flatpak for ring
Apr 11 19:02:27 <pefi>	linuxmodder, interesting idea... thanks! I'll be back!
Apr 11 19:03:08 <linuxmodder>	be advised nothign of those are fully supported here but they are use at your own risk options
Apr 11 19:03:43 <linuxmodder>	supported as in non fedora repos aspect ( ask the respective projects with issues/bugs)
Apr 11 19:04:00 <pefi>	kk4ewt, do you have any info about those hard-coded codecs? I don't like that :-/
Apr 11 19:04:21 <linuxmodder>	pefi,  you have the gitlab repo it's in the readme unless they moved it
Apr 11 19:04:42 <pefi>	linuxmodder,  thanks!
Apr 11 19:04:45 <linuxmodder>	but ring has been  hard-coded for some time
Apr 11 19:06:20 <linuxmodder>	just my personal opinion if the OTR aspect is your thing try another client like pidgin or *tox
Apr 11 19:07:05 <linuxmodder>	*tox at least uses stuff from the supported 3rd party rpmfusion
Apr 11 19:08:19 <linuxmodder>	pefi, i.e. https://fedora.pkgs.org/31/rpmfusion-free-x86_64/qtox-1.16.3-2.20191018gita44cce6.fc31.x86_64.rpm.html
Apr 11 19:08:38 <pefi>	linuxmodder, I guess conversations with my mother in law doesn't need anything special, but I'm advertising jami as good open source stuff. I need to re-think it.
Apr 11 19:09:03 <linuxmodder>	qtox is also opensource and does not have hard coded codecs
Apr 11 19:09:40 <linuxmodder>	pefi, https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md#fedora-easy
Apr 11 19:09:57 <pefi>	thanks!

Apr 11 19:27:01 <kk4ewt>	gambl0re;  because you need the full filename

Apr 11 19:29:35 <gambl0re>	dowdle: that rpm command returns nothing
Apr 11 19:30:02 <linuxmodder>	gambl0re,  you have installed libreoffice yes? or is this gnome where it was preinstalled at install
Apr 11 19:30:30 <linuxmodder>	gambl0re,  does which libreoffice return anything
Apr 11 19:30:42 <gambl0re>	linuxmodder: it was already preinstalled with the distro

Apr 11 19:32:03 <dowdle>	gambl0re: If from packages, I'm guessing you typed it wrong.
Apr 11 19:32:16 <kk4ewt>	then ooffice will work from the cli
Apr 11 19:32:25 <gambl0re>	is fpaste supposed to be slow?

Apr 11 19:37:23 <kk4ewt>	gambl0re;  open a terminal and type ooffice & what happens
Apr 11 19:37:48 <gambl0re>	i tried ooffice, loffice, libreoffice and none of them worked. "command not found"
Apr 11 19:38:08 <tnelis>	@gambl0re: you can also use xdg-open directly on your documents from the terminal; that's usually what you actually want to do. that'll open libreoffice if appropriate.
Apr 11 19:38:25 <kk4ewt>	what DE are you using
Apr 11 19:38:28 <gambl0re>	kde
Apr 11 19:38:56 <pefi>	gamblOre, what do you see after "which ooffice"?
Apr 11 19:39:16 <gambl0re>	oh wow. xdg-open worked.
Apr 11 19:39:20 <gambl0re>	tnelis: thanks
Apr 11 19:39:25 <kk4ewt>	linuxmodder;  boot the kde respin and see if if libreoffice is installed
Apr 11 19:40:55 <gambl0re>	just looked at the man pages for xdg-open. i shouldve been using this command from the start..
Apr 11 19:45:21 <dowdle>	xdg-open - opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application
Apr 11 19:45:51 <dowdle>	gambl0re: but oowriter should work just fine.
Apr 11 19:46:14 <dowdle>	gambl0re: For me xdg-open opens Textmaker (because that is what is set as my default word processor)

Apr 11 19:49:57 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Maybe zsh doesn't have /usr/bin/ in it's path?
Apr 11 19:50:08 <dowdle>	gambl0re: ls -lh /usr/bin/oo*
Apr 11 19:51:06 <gambl0re>	ls: cannot access '/usr/bin/oo*': No such file or directory
Apr 11 19:53:16 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Does "flatpak list" show libreoffice?
Apr 11 19:53:23 <linuxmodder>	it does dowdle:  echo $PATH on my zsh /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/home/linuxmodder/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/var/lib/snapd/snap/bin
Apr 11 19:54:04 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: Well, with snap in there, it's probably a snap package.
Apr 11 19:54:59 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: Or sorry... that's YOUR system.
Apr 11 19:55:15 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: And just because you have something in your path doesn't mean everyone else does. :P~
Apr 11 19:55:58 <linuxmodder>	nonsense I never do anything custom :P
Apr 11 19:56:28 <dowdle>	Ok, I think the mystery is solved.  The KDE Plasma spin DOES NOT have Libreoffice installed.  Period.  It ships with the Caligra office applications.
Apr 11 19:57:46 <dowdle>	gambl0re: My guess is that xdg-open $documentfile is giving you Calligra Words.
Apr 11 19:58:02 <linuxmodder>	what dowdle  said my system was just being slow
Apr 11 19:58:35 <linuxmodder>	sudo dnf install libreoffice-writer OR libreoffice-core whichever floats thy boat best
Apr 11 19:59:03 <linuxmodder>	core is the basics including the excel and ppt variants in libreoffice
Apr 11 20:02:31 <gambl0re>	dowdle: it shows libreoffice on my computer
Apr 11 20:04:04 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Show me a screenshot?  If it is there, you installed it as it is NOT part of the stock KDE Plasma spin... and since the binaries aren't /usr/bin/oo* it wasn't installed with regular rpm packages but either Flatpak or Snap... or something else.
Apr 11 20:05:48 <gambl0re>	dowdle: https://i.imgur.com/dICxCvk.jpg
Apr 11 20:05:52 <gambl0re>	convinced?
Apr 11 20:06:01 <tnelis>	it's likely via flatpak, on my system it doesn't put it in PATH and the XDG app uses flatpak-run
Apr 11 20:06:30 <dowdle>	tnelis: As previously said, xdg-opens whatever your default application is defined for the given document type.
Apr 11 20:06:57 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Yes, and I already mentioned how it got there. :)
Apr 11 20:07:34 <dowdle>	gambl0re: So, the question is, and I don't care if you answer or not... was it installed via flatpak or snap or some other method (like a .tar.gz|xz)?
Apr 11 20:08:03 <gambl0re>	im pretty sure it was installed when i installed the distro
Apr 11 20:08:13 <gambl0re>	i cant remember to be honest..
Apr 11 20:08:18 <tnelis>	@gambl0re: type flatpak run org.libreoffice.LibreOffice to confirm it works via flatpak or not
Apr 11 20:08:43 <gambl0re>	guys it's fine....xdg-open works perfectly.
Apr 11 20:08:48 <gambl0re>	thanks for the help
Apr 11 20:09:55 <dowdle>	gambl0re: If you installed from Fedora F31 GA KDE Plasma media or respin media... it doesn't included LibreOffice.  I just verified that by booting an .iso in a KVM VM.
Apr 11 20:11:34 <gambl0re>	tnelis: it works with that command. so i mustve installed using flatpak.
Apr 11 20:12:18 <gambl0re>	maybe libreoffice comes preinstalled with ubuntu...
Apr 11 20:12:40 <whatnow111>	dowdle, do you use any other distro?
Apr 11 20:13:03 <dowdle>	whatnow111: CentOS, RHEL, and various others in VMs usually just trying to keep up.
Apr 11 20:13:30 <whatnow111>	i see. so basically derivatives of redhat?
Apr 11 20:13:39 <dowdle>	gambl0re: LibreOffice does come preinstalled on the GNOME spin... and maybe a few other spins, but not the KDE Plasma one.
Apr 11 20:14:01 <dowdle>	gambl0re: The reason for that is that KDE has their own office suite named Caligra so that's what they have pre-installed.
Apr 11 20:14:28 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Some of the spins/DEs aimed and lower resource usage might have GNUmeric and Abiword.
Apr 11 20:15:07 <gambl0re>	dowdle: so i have two text editors? libreoffice and caligra?
Apr 11 20:15:31 <gambl0re>	when search for caligra, no results found...
Apr 11 20:15:32 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Most likely.  They aren't "text editors" but yeah. :)
Apr 11 20:15:44 <dowdle>	gambl0re: I might not be spelling it wrong... and maybe you deleted it.
Apr 11 20:16:04 *	dowdle boots the KDE spin one-more-time;
Apr 11 20:17:23 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Or perhaps you used the netinstall media and picked stuff alacart.
Apr 11 20:18:07 <gambl0re>	i installed kde spin...
Apr 11 20:18:17 <gambl0re>	https://i.imgur.com/6fZcxwO.png
Apr 11 20:18:30 <gambl0re>	anyone know why the menu at the top is pixelated?
Apr 11 20:18:56 <gambl0re>	the icons for example are pixelated
Apr 11 20:19:58 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Calligra has two lls
Apr 11 20:20:12 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Here's a screengrab from the Live KDE media I just booted - https://www.montanalinux.org/files/fedora-31-kde-live-office-category-20200411.png
Apr 11 20:20:22 <gambl0re>	oh you're right. i do have calligra words installed
Apr 11 20:24:21 <dowdle>	gambl0re: It is pixelated (and it only seems to be a few icons) that's how the flatpak shipped it.  Generally flatpaks include everything they need or rely on one or more dependency framework flatpaks.
Apr 11 20:25:39 <dowdle>	gambl0re: My stock rpm-based libreoffice writer doesn't seem to have those few pixelated icons.
Apr 11 20:26:10 <dowdle>	gambl0re: It may also be a property of the icons / theme you are using?!?
Apr 11 20:26:47 *	dowdle gets ready to leave the lab dowdle was proctoring.  Later
Apr 11 20:27:37 <tnelis>	(no pixelated issue with flatpak install on my system either)
Apr 11 20:28:18 <tnelis>	gambl0re: look for HiDPI-related issues, that might be the keyword you're looking for
Apr 11 20:28:56 <gambl0re>	it could be because i increased the font-scaling on my computer
Apr 11 20:36:03 <CustosLimen>	ji
Apr 11 20:36:06 <CustosLimen>	hi
Apr 11 20:36:12 <CustosLimen>	I want a USB drive with persistence
Apr 11 20:36:22 <CustosLimen>	but livecd-iso-to-usb does not work that well
Apr 11 20:36:49 <CustosLimen>	If I just install fedora to the USB it should work, but I don't exactly want to boot a VM or something to do that
Apr 11 20:37:07 <specing>	Why not?
Apr 11 20:37:27 <specing>	booting a vm to do that is quite easy
Apr 11 20:41:18 <CustosLimen>	takes more time than just running a script
Apr 11 20:41:24 <CustosLimen>	and doing it over and over again is a bore
Apr 11 20:41:40 <CustosLimen>	I guess I can just try recall how to do a chroot install
Apr 11 20:43:51 <Mershl>	I'd like to use Gnome 3.36 but am usually careful with Beta release. When do you consider a new Fedora release as stable enough?
Apr 11 20:54:12 <tnelis>	Mershl: the current schedule is at https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-32/f-32-key-tasks.html
Apr 11 21:15:03 <rdieter>	Mershl: depends on your definition of "stable enough".  One the conservative side, it's stable enough when it gets released (ie, all blocker bugs are resolved)
Apr 11 21:23:49 <openface>	mr_johnson22[m]: this is not funny, you cant upgrade fedora without failure, or use windows..
Apr 11 21:24:53 <whatnow111>	anyone used m.2 or pcie stick?
Apr 11 21:25:15 <[R]>	whatnow111: what's that?
Apr 11 21:25:32 <whatnow111>	storage device.
Apr 11 21:25:34 <[R]>	so cool
Apr 11 21:25:36 <[R]>	tell me more
Apr 11 21:26:00 <whatnow111>	i read that it's much faster than ssd.
Apr 11 21:26:05 <[R]>	NO WAY
Apr 11 21:27:05 <whatnow111>	it looks like a ram stick. just curious if anyone is using it now.
Apr 11 21:27:16 <[R]>	sounds pretty wicked
Apr 11 21:28:53 <whatnow111>	much faster yet just slightly more expensive. so it's kinda enticing.
Apr 11 21:30:04 <[R]>	very exciting

Apr 11 22:17:08 <wwalker>	for anyone interested in my cursor size problems, I finally found that, in xfce4-mouse-settings, I had the "default" Theme selected, and size set to 48 pixels.  Apparently, although it allows you to set the size, the "default" theme cursor is always 16 pixels.
Apr 11 22:18:56 <wwalker>	So, some apps, were using "default" while others were using other sursor settings (there are a myriad of places you can set the cursor).  firefox and chrome, were both using the xfce "default"
Apr 11 22:19:01 <wwalker>	I selected the only other theme "Adwaita"

Apr 12 00:22:17 <smurfendrek123>	Hi, i had java 14 installed, and then ran sudo dnf install java-13-openjdk, and then my java 14 (which came from the java-latest-openjdk package) turned into java 13 (which also came from the latest package). Is this because the java-latest version got downgraded in the repos of f32? Is this possible since f32 is still in beta?
Apr 12 00:24:48 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps it's a modular thing
Apr 12 00:26:12 <Sokel>	alternatives
Apr 12 00:27:04 <Khaytsus>	Yep, that's likely the way to flip between them
Apr 12 00:28:57 <tnelis>	to expand on what Sokel pointed out in case that wasn't clear, double-check `alternatives --display java`
Apr 12 00:41:54 <smurfendrek123>	@Sokel, yea i can switch with alternatives but 14 isn't available anymore
Apr 12 00:42:13 <smurfendrek123>	@Sokel, only 8 and 13, and i assume 11 if i would install it

Apr 12 01:28:58 <CustosLimen>	I can do it with dnsmasq but it is a bit of a hassle
Apr 12 01:34:46 <akdev>	what do you mean by manage?
Apr 12 01:43:10 <Sokel>	CustosLimen: if you mean manage as in, controlling the PXE menu, mac reservations, kickstarts, repos, etc, look into cobbler.
Apr 12 01:43:35 <CustosLimen>	I think I'm looking for something like MaaS or foreman
Apr 12 01:44:21 <CustosLimen>	seems cobbler may be it also
Apr 12 01:47:29 <akdev>	I am still confused about foreman vs katello vs cobbler
Apr 12 02:53:50 <Sokel>	akdev: katello is a life cycle management plugin for foreman. you use katello to manage machines, pull content repos, create subscriptions, etc.
Apr 12 02:54:03 <Sokel>	the repos are pulled in and managed via pulp.
Apr 12 02:55:29 <Sokel>	foreman, as a whole with its plugins, allows you to provision, config, monitor servers.
Apr 12 02:56:25 <Sokel>	All cobbler is for is automating network based installs.

Apr 12 15:30:57 <FixPleaseTo>	I don't feel good about grub2
Apr 12 15:31:34 <Khaytsus>	Bummer.
Apr 12 15:31:54 <FixPleaseTo>	this is one of the things about linux which I can't get past, I just can't - you read something today, and then tomorrow everything might change. and I mean little weird changes, that slip by your attention
Apr 12 15:32:53 <FixPleaseTo>	right now I renamed my swap partition, and it's in grub.cfg but it does not appear at boot time. I needa manually edit the vmlinuz line (what the hell's a linuz, anyway?)
Apr 12 15:34:32 <FixPleaseTo>	I was under the impression grub is a binary thingy which is driven by configuration commands in a plaintext file.  I ran grub2-mkconfig... what else is missing?
Apr 12 15:37:47 <FixPleaseTo>	in my spare time I thought a thing like computing can really benefit from speculative design, which accounts for future revision/expansion.  I'm not saying you break your head to make something, just don't make something for today, bc today's got only one place it can go!
Apr 12 15:39:27 <FixPleaseTo>	in the spirit of that, I'm going 2 spend my sunday re-learning grub from page 1 - I guess.  maybe I can beat it at its own icky game, or maybe I'll be booting with 'e' from this day on
Apr 12 15:41:53 <FixPleaseTo>	but what I won't do, by god, the next time around, is homebrew my own partition scheme.  vanilla all day long baby, or if it's an option, starch flavor!
Apr 12 15:43:16 <FixPleaseTo>	(this problem arose originally from my allocating a relatively small amount of disk space for my swap partition)

Apr 12 17:54:28 <minall>	Hello Fedora community!
Apr 12 17:56:19 <minall>	Fedora has support for some of my wifi drivers, from which some other 'libre' distros don't have... This apparently are called blobs, and they aren't open source. But Fedora does have support for this, does Fedora contain open source drivers for my wifi driver or is just that these 'libre' distros don't have enough support?
Apr 12 17:57:51 <rdieter>	minall: firmware is probably the difference
Apr 12 17:58:09 <minall>	rdieter: I'm reading about it, trying to understand what these 'blobs' are
Apr 12 17:58:40 <minall>	This of course affects experience since I need to use my wifi but, isn't fedora Open Source?
Apr 12 17:58:43 <rdieter>	minall: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Binary_Firmware  hopefully that clarifies a bit.
Apr 12 17:59:02 <minall>	rdieter: Thanks, I'll read it and come here if there's any questions
Apr 12 17:59:04 <rdieter>	minall: opensource *software*, yes.  firmware policy is a bit more lenient
Apr 12 18:02:35 <minall>	rdieter: I see!, Fedora allows these binaries under some circumstances depending on licencing, that's fine
Apr 12 18:03:02 <minall>	But, are these binaries reversed engineered or checked?
Apr 12 18:07:04 <minall>	Since Fedora is an Open Source community, I want to know that these binaries don't contain harmful code
Apr 12 18:12:38 <FixPleaseTo>	have a good conclusion to your weekend, every1
Apr 12 18:13:16 <specing>	Hello
Apr 12 18:14:01 <specing>	Where is the documentation on the repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d?
Apr 12 18:14:57 <specing>	Specifically, how to change the urls. I see metalink urls, but I'm not sure... is one supposed to use the metalink keyword or something else when refering to a static web server directory?

Apr 12 19:01:46 <plarsen>	How is the "enterprise login" the live workstation image asks for on the first boot supposed to work?
Apr 12 19:02:08 <plarsen>	I find it's rather "dumb" and fails in my case because the hostname right after installation isn't set and isn't FQDN
Apr 12 19:02:27 <plarsen>	ipa-client-install right after setting the proper hostname works just fine
Apr 12 19:04:17 <dowdle>	plarsen: I believe that just lets you join a Microsoft AD domain.
Apr 12 19:04:54 <plarsen>	dowdle, ehhh no. Why in the WORLD would it try to do that? This is Linux?   It errors out that ipa-client-install failed - that's not AD
Apr 12 19:05:03 <dowdle>	plarsen: I've not really used that so I'm not positive.  I wonder if the install docs say.  I would hope so.
Apr 12 19:05:09 <plarsen>	Well it can be inddirectly if freeipa is setup to trust an AD - but that's pretty advanced
Apr 12 19:05:39 <dowdle>	plarsen: I bet you that there are more Linux hosts joined to MS AD than IPA.
Apr 12 19:05:45 <plarsen>	I'm just wondering why the hostname FQDN isn't part of the steps to join a newly installed fedora to IPA
Apr 12 19:06:11 <plarsen>	Ok - you go survey it and when you come back we can talk about how relevant that is.
Apr 12 19:06:12 <dowdle>	plarsen: You can set the hostname during the install.
Apr 12 19:06:30 <plarsen>	dowdle, nope - well, not the FQDN - hostname yes
Apr 12 19:06:43 <plarsen>	And it fails because FQDN isn't there (required)
Apr 12 19:06:56 <dowdle>	plarsen: I don't see a difference between the hostname and an FQDN.
Apr 12 19:10:27 <dowdle>	plarsen: Unfortunately the F31 Installation Guide shows F21 screenshots and doesn't mention the Enterprise Login thing at all. :(
Apr 12 19:10:31 *	dowdle checks RHEL documentation
Apr 12 19:15:44 <dowdle>	Not finding it mentioned there either.
Apr 12 19:18:01 <minall>	The download of the Fedora 32 ISO isn't working?
Apr 12 19:18:10 <minall>	Or is it me? https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/
Apr 12 19:18:25 <minall>	I'm trying to download the beta, but no luck
Apr 12 19:19:34 <minall>	I'm getting 404
Apr 12 19:19:47 <minall>	The's no problem with Fedora 31
Apr 12 19:20:55 <plarsen>	minall, try torrent.fedoraproject.org
Apr 12 19:22:26 <dowdle>	minall: The beta .iso link works for me.
Apr 12 19:23:14 <dowdle>	minall: Looks like the link gives a mirror that uses a mirrorlist so we most likely get different sites.
Apr 12 19:23:32 <minall>	dowdle: Oh, depending on the location
Apr 12 19:23:33 <dowdle>	minall: I can give you a direct URL if you want...
Apr 12 19:23:43 <minall>	Don't worry dowdle, I'm using torrent now
Apr 12 19:24:03 <plarsen>	dowdle, seems that the "enterprise login" isn't really used on the live image then.  Which leads me to think it should be removed as an option.
Apr 12 19:24:13 <plarsen>	It's very easy to setup once the system is installed anyway ...
Apr 12 19:24:46 <plarsen>	YEah - careful with mirrors - not every mirror is good at keeping their inventory consistent and up to date.
Apr 12 19:28:44 <minall>	btw, is redhat free? I wanted to give it a try but It seems they only give me 30 days of try but, what happends after those 30 days?
Apr 12 19:29:32 <[R]>	it self destructs
Apr 12 19:30:07 <dowdle>	plarsen: Looks like they were complaining about the Enterprise Login stuff back in 2013 - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=965888
Apr 12 19:32:44 <minall>	Lol
Apr 12 19:35:53 <mrhubrisje>	question, i was looking into transitioning from ubuntu to fedora and i've got fedora running in a VM. All is going fine but i was trying to customize my shell and wanted to install the extension user-theme. Problem is, it's already installed but gnome tweaks is not showing it ...
Apr 12 19:36:17 <mrhubrisje>	the interwebs aren't very helpful so i'm trying here
Apr 12 19:39:49 <mrhubrisje>	for clarity, it's Fedora Workstation with Gnome
Apr 12 19:40:15 <plarsen>	hehe
Apr 12 19:40:48 <plarsen>	minall, https://developers.redhat.com/topics/linux/
Apr 12 19:51:38 <greatgatsby>	Is RedHat/fedora going all-in with c# ?  I'm glad it's an open-source language, and .net core being cross-platform, just a little worried about having the rug pulled out from underneath it.
Apr 12 19:51:52 <Khaytsus>	greatgatsby: What makes you say anhting bout C#
Apr 12 19:51:57 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, what does "all in" mean?
Apr 12 19:52:01 <Khaytsus>	I don't know of any fedora tools offhnad that are C#
Apr 12 19:53:20 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, it is Microsoft who made dotNet core open source - they're maintaining it upstream. Not really something Red Hat controls. But you probably won't find anyone who thinks open sourcing dotNet was a bad idea.
Apr 12 19:54:55 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: My understanding is that Microsoft is phasing out the proprietary / Windows-only flavors of .Net in preference for the CORE version that is multiplatform.
Apr 12 19:55:08 <plarsen>	dowdle, +1 correct
Apr 12 19:55:28 <plarsen>	It's a different microsoft than 10 years ago, that's for sure.
Apr 12 19:56:11 <Khaytsus>	Considering how much MS profits off Linux these days of course they support some things in it
Apr 12 19:56:19 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: But yeah, Microsoft and Red Hat have quite a few collaborations... getting Windows to work well in KVM, getting Linux to work well in HyperV... Microsoft contributing to the Linux kernel, etc.  And Microsoft wants their development tools to work well on RHEL.
Apr 12 19:57:01 <Khaytsus>	And mark my word, 3 years we'll see a Windows desktop with Linux kernel.  I called it 5 years 2 years ago, so...  sticking with that timeline
Apr 12 19:57:27 <dowdle>	Windows these days is a hybrid with Linux... well, the Windows 10 2004 release has a Linux kernel included for Linux subsystem for Windows... and they are updating File Explorer so that it can read Linux filesystems.
Apr 12 19:57:58 <dowdle>	Khaytsus: Not 3 years from now... but RSN when 2004 is released to GA.
Apr 12 19:58:21 <dowdle>	Khaytsus: They don't use the Linux kernel for Windows... but for the Linux Subsystem for Windows.
Apr 12 19:58:27 <Khaytsus>	#soon
Apr 12 19:58:39 <dowdle>	Oh, I think I'm writing that backwards... the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Apr 12 19:58:51 <dowdle>	Yeah, WSL 2 ships with a Linux kernel.
Apr 12 19:58:59 <Khaytsus>	Just wait.  3 years there will be a Windows desktop that uses the linux kernel
Apr 12 19:59:06 <[R]>	Khaytsus: you're a linux kernel
Apr 12 19:59:24 <dowdle>	Umm, and they have included OpenSSH client installed by default for several releases now, and OpenSSH server an be added easy in the "add Windows features" installer.
Apr 12 19:59:33 <[R]>	Khaytsus: i wonder how far they are into porting their graphical system onto the kernel already
Apr 12 20:05:59 <dowdle>	plarsen: Looks like the Enterprise Login feature is designed to work with IPA, LDAP, and AD.
Apr 12 20:06:55 <greatgatsby>	Khaytsus, plarsen dowdle:  Just followed the RHEL link that was posted, and reminded my that I see so much C# promoting from Red Hat.  Was just curious if this is part of a longer term strategy.
Apr 12 20:09:13 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, having C# on RHEL is a benefit to Red Hat - it breaks one of the last platform barriers. It's also why Microsoft is hard at work breaking the same barriers to Windows. Both sides want _all_ workloads to be compatible with their platform.
Apr 12 20:09:53 <plarsen>	There's a ton of dotNet out there in "enterprise land" and there's a ton of "lamp" and other stacks available that doesn't run on Windows (yet) - so yes, you'll find a lot of happy faces on both sides here seeing potentials
Apr 12 20:10:25 <greatgatsby>	plarsen, understood.  Please don't take my comments as anti C#.  I'm really just geniunely curious if there's a move away from Java and towards C#, where that type of language is appropriate.
Apr 12 20:10:53 <greatgatsby>	plarsen, for sure, I think it's great actually.
Apr 12 20:11:09 <plarsen>	Just know it's really driven by a huge change at Microsoft.  But don't be surprised that companies like Red Hat is all on board with the changes at Microsoft ....
Apr 12 20:12:01 <Pie-jacker875>	should I expect working kde wayland when I choose to update to fedora 32?
Apr 12 20:20:07 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: I doubt Red Hat is moving away from Java since a significant amount of their funds (I've heard, I have no real data) comes from the Java stuff they bought... I forget the name of it... and they maintain various Java versions after Oracle abandons them.
Apr 12 20:20:39 <greatgatsby>	dowdle, I see.  Thanks.
Apr 12 20:21:44 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: Perhaps my info is outdated... on this page (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/) they have Jboss as retired.
Apr 12 20:28:22 <dowdle>	I think maybe they renamed the Java product line.
Apr 12 20:29:44 <dowdle>	Oh, and lots of other JBoss things on that same page that aren't retired.
Apr 12 20:30:27 <dowdle>	COBOL is where it is at for the moment. :)  Given that a lot of U.S. states have unemployment systems written in it.
Apr 12 20:31:50 <MICROburst>	Any walk-throughs for strongswan available? - filetree looks different and some file won't be found: https://paste.centos.org/view/ede053c6
Apr 12 20:45:32 <vbgunz>	hello all. I have an external disk luks encrypted. when I used to attach it to an older distro, it would unlock and follow my fstab to mount it automatically. I'm trying to do the same thing on Fedora 31. I have the right crypttab and key file (and entries in fstab) *but* plugging it in no longer automatically unlocks and mounts it. how can I troubleshoot this?
Apr 12 20:51:22 <Pie-jacker875>	vbgunz: I seem to recall there being something other than fstab where it needs to be, but maybe I'm mistaken
Apr 12 20:51:46 <Pie-jacker875>	perhaps I'm thinking of having it mount when you boot
Apr 12 20:52:49 <vbgunz>	it's an external disk. I have the correct crypttab entries along with the correct key. permissions 0600 and 0400 respectively. the entries in fstab are correct but doing a mount -a doesn't unlock and mount anything
Apr 12 20:53:12 <vbgunz>	I can do it manually but I liked just plugging  it in and it automatically unlocking and mounting
Apr 12 21:03:06 <vbgunz>	hmm.. it seems I have systemd-cryptsetup service files generated for these entries but I can't "enable" them. I get failed to enable unit ... is transient or generated. *but* starting the service file and then calling mount -a works a lot quicker than what I was manually doing
Apr 12 21:03:32 <vbgunz>	but how to make it even quicker (automatically do this after plugging in the external disk)?
Apr 12 21:13:53 <vbgunz>	I'll just settle on running it through a script but do very much appreciate the automatic version (no script)
Apr 12 23:32:57 <dtrainor>	Howdy.  I'm trying to figure out how to run a command after my system has been idle for X period of time.  There's a lot of really strange suggestions out there but it sounds like using dbus-monitor might be the best approach.  I'm not quite sure which data to interpret so that I can make this happen.  Anyone done this before?  Can you point me in the right direction?
Apr 12 23:33:23 <dtrainor>	I have a rack of lab hardware, I'd like to power a lot of it down if I walk away from my workstation for a few hours, power it back up when I return etc.
Apr 12 23:36:15 <dtrainor>	dbus and "Presence" seem to be the name of the game but I'm having trouble gluing these things together.
Apr 12 23:42:32 <CustosLimen>	hi
Apr 12 23:42:56 <CustosLimen>	is there some public smtp server that needs no auth that I can use for sending notifications
Apr 12 23:42:59 <CustosLimen>	like from dnf automatic
Apr 12 23:43:18 <vdamewood>	Probably not, that would quickly become a spam gateway.
Apr 12 23:45:49 <CustosLimen>	😭
Apr 12 23:50:53 <torbjorn>	CustosLimen: your isp might offer one
Apr 12 23:51:08 <torbjorn>	(that is limited to their customer network)
Apr 13 00:27:11 <CharlesIC>	hello, for some reason, the default video player in f31 doesnt open videos
Apr 13 00:27:14 <CharlesIC>	at least .webms
Apr 13 00:27:24 <CharlesIC>	so in cheese, if you click on it, it does nothing
Apr 13 00:27:25 <CharlesIC>	a video
Apr 13 00:27:40 <CharlesIC>	its totem
Apr 13 00:29:22 <CharlesIC>	if i do it from command line, it works - totem foo.webm, but not by clicking on it in the GUI, it just has a clock that moves forever
Apr 13 00:30:47 <CharlesIC>	yeah, it seems to crash
Apr 13 00:52:22 <plarsen>	CustosLimen, I'm sure old fashioned spammers would be thrilled if such a thing existed
Apr 13 02:32:44 <kk4ewt>	CharlesIC; sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 13 02:36:40 <CharlesIC>	kk4ewt, ok
Apr 13 02:36:48 <CharlesIC>	it does it for cheese to a degree also. i have to start cheese in a special way
Apr 13 02:36:52 <CharlesIC>	something with gnome apps for me

Apr 16 16:40:53 <specing>	matt3o12: you can copy the first 2MB (bootloader), then use fdisk to delete the partition table and add a new partition with the same number as on the old hdd but with new start-end sectors, then just dd fedora to that new partition
Apr 16 16:41:53 <matt3o12>	Do I also need the other drives? Like /boot/uefi/ and /boot/? Or is the lvm partion enough?
Apr 16 16:43:20 <matt3o12>	Or are the automatically regenerated?
Apr 16 16:44:49 <Khaytsus>	Fastest way would be a fresh install
Apr 16 16:45:20 <Khaytsus>	But yes if you're moving to a new drive you would need all of the partitions, such as boot, efi, etc
Apr 16 16:45:50 <matt3o12>	I think it would be faster to just copy everything (including windows), and then removing windows in my new drive and remove linux in my old
Apr 16 16:46:21 <Khaytsus>	You could do that I suppose.  And resize partitions, and resize filessytems, and fix stuff, and update fstab, etc.  Up to you :)
Apr 16 16:47:12 <matt3o12>	Where can I learn how to use fstab? I have never sued it before. Resizing the partiations should be easy enough in gnome right?
Apr 16 16:49:06 <Khaytsus>	No idea about 'gnome' but I imagine you'd use the partd guid
Apr 16 16:49:08 <Khaytsus>	gui..
Apr 16 16:57:42 <specing>	matt3o12: ah, I thought it was pre-UEFI. on UEFI my answer does not apply
Apr 16 16:58:15 <matt3o12>	yeah I am using UEFI
Apr 16 16:58:49 <Khaytsus>	Still say you could do a fresh install and migrate much faster
Apr 16 16:59:34 <Khaytsus>	4 days, 22 hours, 0 minutes, 8 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Apr 16 16:59:43 <matt3o12>	I honestly don't want to restore from a backup, that takes way longer (the hard drive is quite slow, maxes out at 40MB after 10min), meanwhile my ssd is at least 200MBs

Apr 16 23:09:44 <renich>	Fedora Core 1 x86_64 ?
Apr 16 23:09:47 <renich>	¬_¬
Apr 16 23:10:26 <cyveris>	Ah, FC1.
Apr 16 23:10:29 <cyveris>	Those were the days.
Apr 16 23:10:33 <renich>	... I wonder how do I get the mouse to work? in Fedora core 1...
Apr 16 23:10:42 <renich>	cyveris: yeah, I remember when I tried it for the first time.
Apr 16 23:10:57 <renich>	what I don't remember is x86_64 in FC1
Apr 16 23:11:16 <renich>	And, btw, the installation fails with x86_64. It only works with i386
Apr 16 23:19:25 <renich>	ha! mouse started working by removing the "tablet" device from the KVM/qemu guest. :D
Apr 16 23:29:22 <renich>	Fixed the repos. :D. Now, I am applying updates! Let's see how that goes...

Apr 17 09:57:03 <ledeni>	chilversc, using Kernel driver in use: nouveau for nvidia gpu driver is open source and sometime make glitches but if you want you can try nvidia driver from rpmfusion repos
Apr 17 10:00:17 <ledeni>	chilversc, check --> https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration  &  https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA?highlight=%28CategoryHowto%29
Apr 17 10:10:00 <chilversc>	ledeni: yeah, I was trying to avoid setting up prime, etc as it seems nouveau is gaining better support for hybrid now
Apr 17 10:10:36 <chilversc>	though I don't thing this is graphics card related this time, as the system worked fine, I just ended up having to log out and log back in to unbreak the overlay
Apr 17 10:11:45 <chilversc>	https://paste.centos.org/view/e172dee8
Apr 17 10:12:01 <chilversc>	though not sure if any of those missing objects are related to the logging out
Apr 17 10:12:36 <chilversc>	maybe the ones around the 28 minute mark, but the error at 26 minutes is what I suspect broke the overlay?
Apr 17 10:15:04 <ledeni>	chilversc, could be
Apr 17 11:20:18 <slavic>	Where would one find the repository for the downstream modified packages for Fedora, say gnome-software?
Apr 17 11:25:11 <[Enrico]>	slavic: https://src.fedoraproject.org/
Apr 17 11:29:22 <slavic>	Thanks Enrico.
Apr 17 11:46:28 <[Enrico]>	slavic: you're welcome
Apr 17 12:59:11 <slavic>	https://pastebin.com/raw/ex3Ci8KT   -- gnome-software compiles on F32 but not on F31. Any insight into the error?
Apr 17 13:00:29 <slavic>	libXau is installed (both 32 and 64 versions)
Apr 17 13:26:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic, rpm -q libgcrypt
Apr 17 13:27:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic,  no idea of why you are installing from source on a packaged distro
Apr 17 13:27:39 <slavic>	I'm trying to fix a bug with gnome-software
Apr 17 13:28:29 <slavic>	rpm -q libgcrypt returns libgcrypt-1.8.5-1.fc31.x86_64 and the 32bit equiv
Apr 17 13:29:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic,  has there been a bugzilla reported
Apr 17 13:29:27 <slavic>	This has been reported everywhere :)
Apr 17 13:30:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	ok then this should be in #fedora-qa and or #fedora-devel
Apr 17 13:30:03 <slavic>	I'm fixing upstream though. I can't get it to compile on a locla machine that exhibits the bug: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/793
Apr 17 13:30:26 <slavic>	ok, I'll move
Apr 17 13:30:28 <slavic>	thanks
Apr 17 13:43:00 <johnfg>	so, just to verify, with fedora, /boot can *not* be on lvm?  No workaround possible?
Apr 17 13:44:16 <Khaytsus>	The bootloader can not read lvm, so no.
Apr 17 13:48:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	lvm isnt started until after the boot loader so there is no way for it to boot if boot was in a lvm
Apr 17 13:49:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	lvm isnt started until after the boot loader so there is no way for it to boot if /boot was in a lvm
Apr 17 13:53:29 <EffSquared>	Hi guys. Does anybody here know where I can find the source of a package if it is not listed on src.fedoraproject.org?
Apr 17 13:53:46 <EffSquared>	I am talking about firefox-wayland in particulat.
Apr 17 13:54:56 <Khaytsus>	EffSquared: Is it not just output from the FF srpm?
Apr 17 13:55:24 <Khaytsus>	Yes it is.
Apr 17 13:57:11 <johnfg>	K thanks.  I'll try and get some non-lvm space for /boot.
Apr 17 13:57:39 <johnfg>	On latest fedora, is there a minimal size for /boot recommended?
Apr 17 13:58:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	EffSquared, dnf info firefox-wayland tells you the source rpm  if nothing else you can get it from koji.fedoraproject.org
Apr 17 13:59:42 <Khaytsus>	johnfg: 500M is the default.  I have 210M used here with a normal setup.
Apr 17 14:00:20 <Khaytsus>	So just make it 500M.  If you make it smaller you'll be fighting with it at some point.
Apr 17 14:04:30 <EffSquared>	@Southern_Gentlem @Khaytsus Thank you for the info, I will have a look at the source package then. I am just looking for some wayland patches to bring over to NixOS.
Apr 17 14:04:56 <EffSquared>	With everybody working from home know, I need pipewire support! ;-)
Apr 17 14:05:13 <Khaytsus>	Everyone needs a hobby
Apr 17 14:05:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	*** Kernel 5.5.17 has been pushed to Testing for F30 and F31: Please test and give Karma on https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=kernel  ***
Apr 17 14:05:41 <johnfg>	I think I have this (which is now not usable for Fedora) at 1 gb.
Apr 17 14:06:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	johnfg, if in the future you are planning to use dnf system-upgrade i advise /boot at 1G
Apr 17 14:06:40 <EffSquared>	Not sure where to report this but all the "Link to raw patch" links on app.fedoraproject.org are broken if there is not direct source package, e.g.  https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/firefox-wayland/sources/patches/
Apr 17 14:06:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	EffSquared, known issue
Apr 17 14:07:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	app is known to be behind the curve
Apr 17 14:07:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	thus use koji which is the fedora builder
Apr 17 14:07:36 <johnfg>	Southern_Gentlem: I will.  especially if I decide I want, like in the case of trying those new kernels, a number of kernels around.
Apr 17 14:08:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	johnfg,  fedora default is 3
Apr 17 14:10:14 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: dnf system-upgrade doesn't use any space in /boot
Apr 17 14:10:22 <Khaytsus>	Maybe one additional kernel?  I dunno
Apr 17 14:11:32 <prussian>	^ can confirm, given my /boot is like 512MiB, I wouldn't be able to install otherwise lol
Apr 17 14:12:21 <Khaytsus>	My /boot has been 477M (why that size, no idea) for years
Apr 17 14:13:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	same here
Apr 17 14:14:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	grrr libvirt update gotta reboot
Apr 17 14:14:59 <Khaytsus>	I had it at just under 250M before this current install (circa f17 as I recall) and I had to randomly fight with it for space in /boot
Apr 17 14:15:02 <\n3p\>	arc-theme is obsolete for fedora 32 or there will be updated?
Apr 17 14:17:45 <Khaytsus>	\n3p\: I see arc-theme built for 32?  Whatever it is.
Apr 17 14:18:00 <Khaytsus>	Ah, it failed, nevermind
Apr 17 14:21:44 <ziff>	what's the right place to report a suspected bug in the SELinux targeted policy in Fedora?
Apr 17 14:23:36 <Khaytsus>	bugzilla
Apr 17 14:23:42 *	Khaytsus points to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla
Apr 17 14:23:49 <Khaytsus>	If it's a Fedora package, of course.  Third party package, no.
Apr 17 14:24:09 <ziff>	yep, vanilla Fedora 31
Apr 17 14:24:09 <ziff>	thanks!
Apr 17 14:25:02 <Khaytsus>	ziff: Make sure your system is labeleled correctly first, wouldn't be a bad idea to relabel the whole system and test.  Unless you're absolutely sure selinux has never been off, never moved files around with non-selinux suoporting tools, etc
Apr 17 14:46:42 <EffSquared>	\quit Thanks for the help
Apr 17 14:56:19 <ziff>	Khaytsus: thanks for the suggestion, doing an autorelabel seems to have resolved it (I don't quite understand why though - the labels of the involved process and file don't seem to have changed).
Apr 17 15:00:24 <mulletman>	Hey, i know this isnt a gaming channel (is there a linux gaming channel?) but for gaming on linux, for things like 0ad and maybe doom 2016 or the older halflifes would something with like an AMD A4-7300B and 8G mem be enough?
Apr 17 15:00:47 <mulletman>	Im not looking for a super system, just "good enough"
Apr 17 15:01:40 <billings>	what kind of GPU?  or does that have an integrated GPU?
Apr 17 15:01:57 <rudrab>	in f32, workspace is not visible. 4-finger swipe is working, but there is no indecator on the right of the screen
Apr 17 15:02:06 <mulletman>	integrated i think, was looking at refuirbished options on newegg
Apr 17 15:02:10 <plundra>	A4-7300B sounds very underpowered? https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+A4+PRO-7300B+APU&id=2439
Apr 17 15:02:49 <mulletman>	if i popped a GPU in there would that compensate for the older cpu?
Apr 17 15:03:08 <plundra>	The cpu it self seems super slow.
Apr 17 15:03:54 <mulletman>	thats a pity, does anyone know of any (used is fine) sub $400 systems that can play older games?
Apr 17 15:04:23 <mulletman>	(doom 2016 being the newest i have on my list)
Apr 17 15:05:15 <plundra>	I got a new system last weekend, and have been playing DOOM 2016 for the first time. Replacing my old Skull Canyon NUC, which has this cpu: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=intel+core+i7-6770hq+%40+2.60ghz&id=2759
Apr 17 15:05:38 <plundra>	And I wouldn't even think of trying DOOM 2016 on it. But maybe I'm wrong, don't know how low it scales. Maybe it's great.
Apr 17 15:07:10 <mulletman>	doh, that is way out of my price range.
Apr 17 15:07:23 <plundra>	Yeah no, not suggesting it, just for comparsion
Apr 17 15:07:24 <mulletman>	maybe i will jsut replay half life again a few times lol
Apr 17 15:07:41 <plundra>	https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+A8+PRO-7600B+APU&id=2352 That is even cheaper than the HP I assume you were looking at, in the refurb section?
Apr 17 15:07:49 <plundra>	The Lenovo one, at newegg.
Apr 17 15:08:01 <mulletman>	so you think that your system wouldnt run doom 2016?
Apr 17 15:08:07 <mulletman>	i was indeed
Apr 17 15:09:09 <plundra>	Not really, but I haven't tried :) And it's in iffy shape, cut screen in the beginning of HL2 it crashes.
Apr 17 15:09:16 <plundra>	It's running Debian, so probably why :P
Apr 17 15:11:21 <mulletman>	:)
Apr 17 15:13:03 <plundra>	mulletman: Going by the Minimum spec for DOOM 2016 in Steam, they have these cpus https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-FX-8320-Eight-Core-vs-Intel-i5-2400/1782vs793
Apr 17 15:13:47 <plundra>	To get a feel for it. I'm sure there's a million more factors, but I'd try and compare cpu mark score to get a feel for what might be doable.
Apr 17 15:14:25 <plundra>	That's a 2010 and 2012 cpu, but higher end ones at that time maybe.
Apr 17 15:17:58 <mulletman>	thanks for looking that up, i need to use cpubenchmarks more :)
Apr 17 15:21:06 <mulletman>	I know this isnt a lin/fed question but on spubenchmarks i see they have the option to buy now but the link doesnt seem to point to a page that one can buy said system, is there a way? (that would be the most super custom option i have ever seen but had to ask)
Apr 17 15:21:35 <mulletman>	agh. nix that previous question
Apr 17 15:21:57 <mulletman>	i had it in my head those were prices for systems not cpus. duh.
Apr 17 15:24:46 <plundra>	mulletman: If you are comfortable building a system by yourself? :-) https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/wQscCJ/budget-homeoffice-build
Apr 17 15:25:21 <mulletman>	am lazy :P but can put a sys together
Apr 17 15:25:30 <mulletman>	thanks for the link
Apr 17 15:25:33 <plundra>	(Just found as an example of within budget and as a starting point)
Apr 17 15:25:57 <mulletman>	am cheaper than lazy though so might end up going this route, thanks :)
Apr 17 15:26:32 <plundra>	No worries. I haven't built a system for like 15 years, before this last week when I finally did it again. Have been using Intel NUCs and playing games accordingly.
Apr 17 15:27:30 <mulletman>	lol, i usually avoid it but ended up having to put my server together last year as i coudnt find anything prebuilt that wasnt an absolute fortune
Apr 17 15:27:39 <plundra>	So very happy with it, everything just worked out of the box with no issues. Went with the Fedora 32 beta, because felt fine for new home/game pc. Graphics and all, just works great. Having steam as a third party repo built in just enabling was nice, just like in Debian.
Apr 17 15:28:20 <plundra>	Well yeah, I've liked the NUCs and been fine with the premium of them, price/performance. Because I just want something that works. Not having to figure out parts and pick the right thing.
Apr 17 15:28:32 <mulletman>	I hear ya!
Apr 17 15:28:39 <plundra>	But being budget constrained, I'd definitly go with building myself.
Apr 17 15:29:09 <mulletman>	btw, have you used steam? does that require CDs?
Apr 17 15:29:10 <plundra>	Specially after building this one successfully :D
Apr 17 15:29:19 <plundra>	Yes a lot, and no never.
Apr 17 15:29:35 <plundra>	You can at most enter a CD-key of old games you own (Like, a hardcopy of Half-Life) to add to it :)
Apr 17 15:30:15 <plundra>	Not sure if you ever could use a CD/DVD with Steam actually, for copying data I mean. I think it's been over the internet always.
Apr 17 15:30:39 <mulletman>	sweet! still got that, was going to try playonlinux but wasnt looking forward to it (wine, even a sanitized version, and I never have gotten along it seems)
Apr 17 15:31:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	mulletman, use the wine in fedora
Apr 17 15:32:16 <mulletman>	i do, mainly for foobar2000 but i have used it for a few other things but things usually end up working suboptimally (ie buggy)
Apr 17 15:32:52 <plundra>	I'm really impressed by Steam and the proton-magic, making DOOM 2016 available. Totally seamless, ps aux shows a .exe but nothing would make me think it wasn't native from the experience.
Apr 17 15:33:35 <plundra>	No like, "install on windows, copy the files, rotate computer towards the moon, pray some winetricks fixes helps, and then MAYBE it works"
Apr 17 15:34:08 <mulletman>	yeah, thats what i have heard - hence my renewed interest (plus the whole not going out thing lol)
Apr 17 15:35:45 <plundra>	Bing stuck at home definitly helped push me to pull the trigger :)
Apr 17 15:35:56 <johnfg>	What do you think is the *safest* way to shrink lvol1, in the current os (on vg0) or with gparted,           or can fedora installer handle this?
Apr 17 15:36:48 <johnfg>	that may not have  been a clear question: use my current os to adjust lvm, use gparted, or fedora installer?
Apr 17 15:37:52 <plundra>	I'd prep as much as possible before launching the installer. Just in general.
Apr 17 15:39:00 <plundra>	But are you using the filesystem currently? Then booting up the install media seems the right way to do it.
Apr 17 15:39:48 <plundra>	I always use xfs when having the option, so shrinking filesystem isn't an option, so no need to worry about it.
Apr 17 15:40:35 <RagingBuffalo>	Hi here, is there a pro with thunderbolt who could help me understand how to force recognise the docking again, on Fedora 31? as in a command to rescan or something
Apr 17 15:40:43 <RagingBuffalo>	as I do "boltctl list" I get nothing
Apr 17 15:41:18 <RagingBuffalo>	I also systemctl restart bolt.service
Apr 17 15:41:50 <RagingBuffalo>	I get this now with status: https://paste.centos.org/view/434ff28d
Apr 17 15:43:40 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: Hey I did $ xmodmap -e "keycode 89 = NoSymbol"  and it did the trick, the F5 key no longer works, thanks a lot, I love this keyboard I didn't want to discard it for a key
Apr 17 15:49:12 <RagingBuffalo>	seems that unplugging the mini DP cable on the docking side (and not on the computer side)
Apr 17 15:49:20 <RagingBuffalo>	made it automatically recnogised again
Apr 17 15:49:56 <RagingBuffalo>	that did not make the screen read again the signal, they are still blank
Apr 17 15:51:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	RagingBuffalo, reboot with dock attached?
Apr 17 15:51:29 <RagingBuffalo>	yes that usually work, after a few reboots. Sometimes immediately
Apr 17 15:51:39 <RagingBuffalo>	sometimes I have to disconnect the power of the docking
Apr 17 15:51:51 <RagingBuffalo>	I was trying a less disrupting workaround
Apr 17 15:52:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	so shutdown power cycle the dock and then restart the computer
Apr 17 15:52:14 <RagingBuffalo>	I usually waste 20min-1h everyday with that j*nk
Apr 17 15:52:59 <RagingBuffalo>	im int he middle of a training, thats why I don't want to reboot right now, I have several labs running
Apr 17 15:53:09 <RagingBuffalo>	I lost the screens
Apr 17 15:53:12 <RagingBuffalo>	beside laptop screen
Apr 17 15:53:56 <RagingBuffalo>	a bit ugly errors: https://paste.centos.org/view/2df966b2
Apr 17 15:57:53 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: Still seems a bit crazy that you have issues with f5..  what keyboard?
Apr 17 15:58:39 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: is an HP wireless one, is really comfortable
Apr 17 15:59:13 <RagingBuffalo>	it crashed, once I reconnected the docking, it froze the laptoip
Apr 17 15:59:30 <Khaytsus>	ew, low profile chicklets.  but odd f5 is in the way.  Anywho, glad it sorted it out fo ryou
Apr 17 15:59:44 <RagingBuffalo>	it just had the time to generate a report
Apr 17 15:59:46 <RagingBuffalo>	list_del corruption, ffff8e4aa25cf6a8->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100) [thunderbolt]
Apr 17 16:00:11 <RagingBuffalo>	so funny... POISON1 (dead)
Apr 17 16:00:15 <RagingBuffalo>	looks scary
Apr 17 16:01:11 <RagingBuffalo>	In the end I had to reboot after all, lost all my lab servers great...
Apr 17 16:08:40 <Robby>	question, so, we have https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages where we can lookup package info, what I am missing, however, is the ability to see a list of dependencies
Apr 17 16:08:40 <RagingBuffalo>	is there a way to check detection of screens in Wayland, I googled a lot I can't find much
Apr 17 16:08:45 <stofflswelt>	Hi! How can I view, what iss et as default browser?
Apr 17 16:09:12 <Robby>	the question is: is there some other fedoraproject webapp that shows this info?
Apr 17 16:11:39 <stofflswelt>	The funny thing is when I try xdg-open http://fedoraproject.org - Mozilla Thunderbird is openen.... *puzzled*
Apr 17 16:13:28 <RagingBuffalo>	stofflswelt, right click on html file and "open with"?
Apr 17 16:13:33 <RagingBuffalo>	if you use Gnome
Apr 17 16:15:34 <Robby>	found a workaround to my issue I guess, its to use https://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/
Apr 17 16:16:28 <Robby>	that one shows a "requires" section
Apr 17 16:17:05 <RichardET>	My personal opinion is that Fedora Mate seems to be the most easy to use of the Fedora spins
Apr 17 16:17:19 <RichardET>	any other views out there?
Apr 17 16:19:28 <matt3o12>	Hey, according to disks I have a 980GB block storage device with a ext file system (it is part of a LVM partition, the LVM is 997GB and the hard drive is 1000GB). When I mount the partition and write df -h, it only shows 898G (assuming df uses GiB not GB), I am missing about ~15GiB, where did they go?
Apr 17 16:21:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	RichardET, please see the channelfaq in the topic
Apr 17 16:22:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	basicly comes down to dsdf
Apr 17 16:25:48 <matt3o12>	 I ran resize2fs on that drive before that (without any specific size), maybe it didn't increase the file system all the way?
Apr 17 16:31:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	1000000000/1024
Apr 17 16:46:16 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: yeah, must be a hardware issue, but with this fix I have keyboard for some more time
Apr 17 16:49:46 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/02/hp-wireless-elite-keyboard-v2-primary-with-mouse-100789040-large.3x2.jpg
Apr 17 16:50:09 <sincere_fox>	chiclet indeed
Apr 17 17:03:10 <Khaytsus>	So curious.. how do you keep hitting F5? :P
Apr 17 17:03:31 <sincere_fox>	Not me
Apr 17 17:04:06 <sincere_fox>	it starts registering F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5
Apr 17 17:04:22 <sincere_fox>	so the websites start loading and loading and loading lol
Apr 17 17:06:29 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: OH.  The keyboard is broken?  Stuck key?
Apr 17 17:10:53 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: exactly, very frustrating
Apr 17 17:11:30 <Khaytsus>	So it's still going to cause you some issues with rollover etc, but if it works......  maybe you should fix it though ;)  Probably some crumb or something in it.
Apr 17 17:14:30 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: I've tried to clean it but doesn't seem to be the problem,
Apr 17 17:14:51 <Khaytsus>	Try whacking it with a hammer?
Apr 17 17:15:20 <peque>	Hi there! :-) I created a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. I can load this configuration with Firefox and everything works as expected. When I try to configure Chromium to do the same, the browser opens the GNOME network settings. I can configure the Network Proxy from there: select "Automatic" and pass `file:///my/path/to/pac.js` as the configuration URL, just like I would do with Firefox. I turn off the wired connection, then
Apr 17 17:15:21 <peque>	turn it on again and... nothing happens. The proxy does not seem to work and I can not use Chromium to get to the domains behind the proxy. Any idea on what could be wrong? Using Fedora 31 Workstation. Thanks in advance! ^^
Apr 17 17:16:05 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: well, that's something I havent try for sure
Apr 17 17:17:36 <vwbusguy>	I'm having some trouble upgrading to f32 since some modules are stuck looking for f31 release (gimp, libgit2).  I could just uninstall reinstall these, but is there an obvious way to upgrade them?
Apr 17 17:17:56 <Khaytsus>	Yuck, still weirdness updating with modules? :(
Apr 17 17:18:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	vwbusguy,  uninstall the modules
Apr 17 17:18:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	then try again
Apr 17 17:18:26 <whatnow111>	hey southern.
Apr 17 17:19:19 *	Southern_Gentlem grabs a dryer sheet to clear away the static cling 
Apr 17 17:20:54 <whatnow111>	southern, i found one thing i overlooked when try to make the computer less noisier.
Apr 17 17:21:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	what was that
Apr 17 17:21:27 <whatnow111>	a good case.
Apr 17 17:22:41 <whatnow111>	with thicker panel. the one i was using was a cooler master haf and i think due to thinner side panel, the noise was audible.
Apr 17 17:24:59 <whatnow111>	i had an ancient antec case. when i transferred the same motherboard over, i hear much less fan noise.
Apr 17 17:26:06 <vwbusguy>	Southern_Gentlem, disabling the modules worked
Apr 17 17:26:23 <vwbusguy>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks
Apr 17 17:26:43 <mangoicedtea>	how do I install soulseek? http://www.soulseekqt.net/news/node/1
Apr 17 17:27:10 <mangoicedtea>	please help, thanks
Apr 17 17:31:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, what have you done
Apr 17 17:31:40 <mangoicedtea>	Southern_Gentlem, just downloaded the .tgz file
Apr 17 17:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	and its a compressed file
Apr 17 17:32:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	so uncompress it
Apr 17 17:32:47 <mangoicedtea>	ok done there is an appimage
Apr 17 17:33:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	have you read their documentation on how to install
Apr 17 17:34:38 <mangoicedtea>	nope
Apr 17 17:34:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am not going to install that on my system to tell you how to install it
Apr 17 17:34:39 <peque>	I have used the GNOME Settings to try to configure a proxy loading a local Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. The configuration is taking no effect. Any idea on what could be wrong? (the configuration file is fine, since it works when loaded with Firefox)
Apr 17 17:36:09 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, If it's an appimage, normally you can run it directly
Apr 17 17:36:36 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, like it's an executable.  Make sure you really trust where you downloaded it from!
Apr 17 17:37:36 <mangoicedtea>	vwbusguy, https://paste.centos.org/view/dba55f33
Apr 17 17:38:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, dnf search xcb
Apr 17 17:38:29 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, It's not packaged by Fedora so your support here will be pretty limited for that
Apr 17 17:40:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, we highly discourage stuff like this but it is your machine so your issue
Apr 17 17:41:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, there is a client for soulseek in the repos
Apr 17 17:42:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf search soulseek
Apr 17 17:49:57 <mangoicedtea>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks
Apr 17 18:02:48 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: 32 only?  I don't see anything here.
Apr 17 18:03:13 <Khaytsus>	Oooh, gotcha.  not that name, I see it now
Apr 17 18:04:16 <Khaytsus>	So what is soulseek anyway, besides piracay
Apr 17 18:04:18 <Khaytsus>	piracy
Apr 17 18:06:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	p2p network
Apr 17 18:07:36 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, piracy
Apr 17 18:12:53 <peque>	Khaytsus, I usually use p2p networks to download Fedora images :-P
Apr 17 18:14:14 <Khaytsus>	...

Apr 17 18:16:19 <yates_home>	i'm trying to get sdk installed
Apr 17 18:16:29 <yates_home>	per https://gradle.org/install/
Apr 17 18:16:43 <yates_home>	is aws-sdk-java THAT sdk?
Apr 17 19:16:28 <overflyer>	So ChanServ directed me here from #redhat
Apr 17 19:16:33 <overflyer>	Hello everyone, is the project of bpfilter different from what Facebook is planning to replace iptables/nftables with using eBPF technology? I heard there is supposed to be a Facebook talk out there from the BPDF summit on November 12, 2019 but I cant find it.
Apr 17 19:29:03 <dowdle>	overflyer: Find the homepage of bpfilter?
Apr 17 19:29:59 <overflyer>	no not the home page just some third-party articles about it
Apr 17 19:30:02 <dawud>	overflyer: https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2019/talks/bpf-at-facebook/ but slideshare is down for me at the moment
Apr 17 19:30:27 <overflyer>	I can see the slideshare and use it
Apr 17 19:30:29 <overflyer>	awesome
Apr 17 19:30:33 <overflyer>	thank you!
Apr 17 19:30:46 <dowdle>	https://linux-audit.com/bpfilter-next-generation-linux-firewall/
Apr 17 19:30:58 <overflyer>	ah yes I got this article open
Apr 17 19:31:36 <overflyer>	So lets see if facebook is doing something different or if it is just using bpfilter....

Apr 17 20:40:47 <aterius>	I updated to Fedora 32, and I'm not having issues with DNS resolution in docker, (I can't use podamn currently I've filed a few pending bugs) of the form ```Err1: 1 https://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security

Apr 17 20:40:58 <aterius>	Anyoen else having issues?
Apr 17 20:49:48 <Khaytsus>	aterius: No, but perhaps you need some proxy stuff if you use a proxy
Apr 17 20:50:06 <Khaytsus>	I had to set proxy vars in docker envs at work because we have a proxy we have to manually set
Apr 17 20:50:11 <aterius>	 * Anyone else having issues?
Apr 17 20:51:17 <aterius>	Yeah, I'm not using a proxy. Just a standard networking environment

Apr 17 21:29:35 <vwbusguy>	Fedora 32 upgrade went fine.  I did have to remove some py2 libs and disable a couple of modules.  I didn't lose anything important with the py2 libs.
Apr 17 21:29:49 <vwbusguy>	dnf check showed empty after the upgrade
Apr 17 21:39:52 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: about 7 weeks too early IMO ;)
Apr 17 21:40:16 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: but that's.... interesting.  modules, eh..  I dunno why those don't upgrade, that seems buggy.. but python modules?
Apr 17 21:40:23 <vwbusguy>	Khaytsus, that is your opinion and you're welcome to it.  I upgrade a week or two before GA so I can hel pout my coworkers.
Apr 17 21:40:27 <vwbusguy>	*help put
Apr 17 21:40:30 <vwbusguy>	*help out...
Apr 17 21:40:46 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: I do too.. in a vm ;)
Apr 17 21:40:48 <vwbusguy>	Khaytsus, Not python modules.  gimp was one of them.  libgit2 was another.  and jmx.
Apr 17 21:41:05 <Khaytsus>	erm, py libs...sorry
Apr 17 21:41:18 <vwbusguy>	I had to remove some python libs via dnf first
Apr 17 21:41:24 <Khaytsus>	Odd...
Apr 17 21:41:36 <vwbusguy>	I don't remember which ones but they didn't take anything important with them
Apr 17 21:41:55 <Khaytsus>	I guess I'll see when I update in a few months
Apr 17 21:42:07 <vwbusguy>	I think they were probably orphaned gnome deps from older versions
Apr 17 21:42:25 <vwbusguy>	(I know, you don't like gnome...)
Apr 17 21:47:25 <Khaytsus>	I'm not allowed to talk about gnome anymore
Apr 17 21:50:53 <peque>	For anybody interested, I ended up creating an issue in GNOME Settings (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/957) it seems the problem is with trying lo use a local file (i.e.: `file:///...`)
Apr 17 21:54:29 <akuhcap>	Hey im trying out wayland instead of xorg on this install and im wondering how i should go about with drivers.  I have a nvidia 1660
Apr 17 21:58:52 <piston>	Can anyone suggest If conflicting services are on here? I am not able to connect wifi.
Apr 17 21:58:57 <piston>	https://pastebin.com/PVYmu9H7
Apr 17 22:01:14 <piston>	I shouldnt have installed with deepin as primary environment,
Apr 17 22:01:54 <piston>	thats where the conflict started I feel, now not able to connect on any environment.
Apr 17 23:05:25 <mrvenkman>	Question about partitioning: I have just removed some space from my windows partition using gparted. Freed up ~10G how do I now allocate that to my home? https://pasteboard.co/J4hJWS7.png
Apr 17 23:07:40 <tolland>	hey, im getting loads of peculiar scrambled windows problems since the last update
Apr 17 23:08:51 <tolland>	firefox and chrome keep crashing with glitched windows
Apr 17 23:11:11 <mrvenkman>	Nailed it.
Apr 18 00:07:13 <mrvenkman>	I think I might of just fucked up my /home partition.
Apr 18 00:07:13 <Khaytsus>	mrvenkman: This is a family channel, such language is not acceptable.  Please remember children and their grandmothers may be watching.
Apr 18 00:07:47 <Jordan_U>	mrvenkman: What exactly did you do to your /home/ partition?
Apr 18 00:08:41 <mrvenkman>	Well, I tried to add to it from my Windows partition. I freed up some space (only 10Gb) using gparted. Then I couldn't move the new space so I thought ,,,
Apr 18 00:08:57 <mrvenkman>	Maybe it's because I am using the swap space etc.
Apr 18 00:09:04 <mrvenkman>	so I used a LIVE usb stick
Apr 18 00:09:19 <mrvenkman>	and tried with that. It's complicated.
Apr 18 00:09:28 <mrvenkman>	I am here so it's not all bad.
Apr 18 00:11:12 <mrvenkman>	Actually it's not as bad as I thought.
Apr 18 00:13:56 <mrvenkman>	What is the difference between a root partition and a home partition?
Apr 18 00:14:40 <mrvenkman>	tmpfs                                     3040896  1899040   1141856  63% /tmp

Apr 18 00:15:48 <mrvenkman>	Shouldn't the most space be allocated to "home2?
Apr 18 00:16:27 <kk4ewt>	lsblk|fpaste please
Apr 18 00:16:36 <kk4ewt>	and df -h |fpaste

Apr 18 00:19:25 <mrvenkman>	Not even a screenshot! It's selectable!
Apr 18 00:19:33 <mrvenkman>	I am really enjoying Fedora
Apr 18 00:20:12 <mrvenkman>	I selected the defaults when I installed it ... just don't know why I don't have much space.
Apr 18 00:20:53 <mrvenkman>	So I took 10G off winblows and it's now free to use. I would like that to use.
Apr 18 00:24:41 <BobLfoot>	mrvenkman: root is systemspace while home is userspace
Apr 18 00:25:25 <mrvenkman>	BobLfoot, ok thanks. Can I basically not re-allocate space to home?
Apr 18 00:25:53 <mrvenkman>	kk4ewt, sorry for the pasting of text .. that fpaste utility is amazing!
Apr 18 00:26:28 <Khaytsus>	Looks like the 10g is just a partition, not allocated to anything, not part of the lvm
Apr 18 00:27:27 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, I took it off my windows partition using gparted. Then I reformatted it to be lvm in the hope I could add that 10g to my home
Apr 18 00:27:41 <Khaytsus>	it's just a partition, not part of your lvm
Apr 18 00:28:10 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, ok. But it id formatted as lvm?
Apr 18 00:28:19 <Khaytsus>	doesn't really matter
Apr 18 00:28:24 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, ok
Apr 18 00:28:27 <mrvenkman>	:(
Apr 18 00:28:55 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, how would I go about moving it to home?
Apr 18 00:29:46 <Khaytsus>	First off, you said your /home is broken..  is it?
Apr 18 00:29:57 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, no ... I thought it was
Apr 18 00:30:08 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, I am using it right now.
Apr 18 00:30:38 <BobLfoot>	mrvenkman: As I understand it you can allegedly add the new partition to the lvm and then to home, but I've never had success doing that.  Crashed many a system trying.  YOu could also format the partition and mount it to your existing system and have a /home2 or /stuff section for files.  That's probably clear as mud but best I can desscribe it.
Apr 18 00:30:42 <Khaytsus>	then you just pvcreate on the new partion then vgextend existinglvm /new/partition
Apr 18 00:30:50 <mrvenkman>	I thought I lost any remaining space from /home but it seems I haven't.
Apr 18 00:30:55 <Khaytsus>	https://www.krenger.ch/blog/linux-lvm-how-to-adding-a-new-partition/    read through that
Apr 18 00:31:08 <Khaytsus>	basically this person is adding /dev/sdb1 (a new partition) to his existing lvm, named 'pandora'
Apr 18 00:31:48 <Khaytsus>	but that just adds the space, you'd have to extend etc
Apr 18 00:31:53 <BobLfoot>	disclaimer it has been a few fedora releases since I messed with lvm/pvm I'm sure things have improved.  Khaytsus's instructions would be more current than mine
Apr 18 00:31:54 <mrvenkman>	BobLfoot, and Khaytsus thank you :) :) I'll read through the help. BobLfoot Thank you :)
Apr 18 00:32:06 <Khaytsus>	Honestly the _easiest_ thing.....  is just format that new partition as ext4 and use it as storage
Apr 18 00:32:20 <BobLfoot>	Khaytsus: ++
Apr 18 00:32:43 <Khaytsus>	Messing about with the lvm is a neat exercise but...  well..  a lv spread over two drives is twice as much failure opportunity
Apr 18 00:33:16 <Khaytsus>	If you can find 10g of chunk of stuff you can move to it, or whatever, that'll work out just as well
Apr 18 00:33:28 <Khaytsus>	and you don't have to do nearly as much..  just format it and mount it
Apr 18 00:34:10 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, interesting.
Apr 18 00:34:40 <Khaytsus>	You can do that booted from the system itself.. make sure it's working, pretty trivial..  add it to fstab
Apr 18 00:34:51 <mrvenkman>	Yeh
Apr 18 00:35:14 <Khaytsus>	you can then chown the mount point as your user and write to the whole drive, or mkdir something and chown it..
Apr 18 00:35:24 <mrvenkman>	Yeh
Apr 18 00:35:47 <mrvenkman>	I answered a question on the fedora website about that...
Apr 18 00:36:26 <mrvenkman>	https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/vagrant-up-not-mounting-the-directory/6040/2
Apr 18 00:37:08 <mrvenkman>	But forget that, my issue is that I just need the space
Apr 18 00:37:36 <mrvenkman>	I'm gonna read that link you gave me and report back.
Apr 18 00:37:48 *	dowdle gives mrvenkman a few spacebars, some commas, and finally a period.
Apr 18 00:37:50 <mrvenkman>	Thank you, Khaytsus and BobLfoot
Apr 18 00:44:37 <mrvenkman>	Right .. am gonna reboot using the live usb. wish me luck! if I'm not back in an hour - call tech support!
Apr 18 01:24:13 <ossifrage>	This is annoying, wireshark in f31 can't read from a pipe without being a member of the wirshark group
Apr 18 01:25:11 <ossifrage>	"ssh ... tcpdump -i eth0 -s 1800 -w - udp port 53 | wireshark -k -i -" used to work, now it fails with a permission denied error dialog (for /usr/bin/dumppcap
Apr 18 01:26:04 <ossifrage>	 /usr/bin/dumppcap is now 0750

Apr 18 18:21:19 <retentiveboy>	`iptables -L INPUT` shows first entry ACCEPT's related traffic as expected but second entry ACCEPT's all from anywhere to anywhere.
Apr 18 18:21:36 <retentiveboy>	Am I reading this correctly?
Apr 18 18:22:22 <retentiveboy>	3rd rule jumps to INPUT_direct and 4th to INPUT_ZONES.  That 2nd one though seems to short-circuit and accept anything.
Apr 18 19:43:29 <dowdle>	So, when there is a package for something AND a module... and the module is older... how to I get dnf to install the newer package?
Apr 18 19:43:46 <dowdle>	I'm guessing that I've got something set saying the module is preferred... but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot that.
Apr 18 19:44:17 <dowdle>	The package in question is gimp-2.10.18 package vs the gimp-2.10.14 module (in Fedora 32)

Apr 18 20:02:05 <sincere_fox>	maybe gets pressed faster than xmodmap has the chance to register?
Apr 18 20:02:10 <zuvy>	Im attempting to install from a source and it says I need TypeScript 3.8, dnf cant find it. Help please!
Apr 18 20:02:17 <[R]>	xmodmap isn't a deamon
Apr 18 20:02:21 <[R]>	it remaps the keyboard in X
Apr 18 20:02:39 <[R]>	zuvy: you'll have to talk to the author if they dont provide a good dependency list
Apr 18 20:02:54 <dowdle>	zuvy: What version of Fedora?
Apr 18 20:03:08 <zuvy>	dowdle: 32
Apr 18 20:03:10 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: Broken keyboard bruh
Apr 18 20:03:35 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: But how is the name of everything on earth and elsewhere is this broken keyboard bypassing xmodmap
Apr 18 20:04:26 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: pay shipping and I'll mai you a proper keyboard
Apr 18 20:04:27 <Khaytsus>	IBM M

Apr 18 20:31:23 <NoOova>	Guys i have a problem with wireguard via network namager.
Apr 18 20:31:56 <NoOova>	nmcli connection up "Linode WireGuard"
Apr 18 20:32:00 <NoOova>	Error: Connection activation failed: The VPN service 'org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wireguard' was not installed.
Apr 18 20:32:31 <NoOova>	I have a "wireguard-tools-1.0.20200319-1.fc30.x86_64" installed
Apr 18 20:33:55 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: I am even getting the roll over problems you waid
Apr 18 20:34:00 <sincere_fox>	said* lo
Apr 18 20:34:04 <sincere_fox>	lol*
Apr 18 20:34:52 <Khaytsus>	NoOova: You have wireguard itself?
Apr 18 20:35:35 <Khaytsus>	the module, that is
Apr 18 20:35:43 <Khaytsus>	Just wireguard-utils isn't going to do it
Apr 18 20:35:51 <NoOova>	I have a 'wg' command in my desktop fedora. Also i setted up a connection in network preferences (in network manager interface)
Apr 18 20:36:01 <Khaytsus>	rpm -qa | grep wireguard
Apr 18 20:36:11 <Khaytsus>	if you don't have a kmod-wireguard you missed a step ;)
Apr 18 20:36:24 <NoOova>	i have no kernel module
Apr 18 20:36:41 <NoOova>	ok. thx
Apr 18 20:39:59 <zaccanasta>	hi guys, i'm playing with dwm and wanna run few programs upon login. none of .Xclients, .xprofile, .xinitrc seem to work
Apr 18 20:41:05 <[R]>	how are you starting dwm
Apr 18 20:42:01 <zaccanasta>	now i'm playing with it in rawhide on a VM. It's started by gdm
Apr 18 20:42:27 <[R]>	none of those files have antyhing to do with autostart
Apr 18 20:42:36 <[R]>	your wm needs to support autostart if you want things to autostart
Apr 18 20:43:49 <zaccanasta>	[R]: ok so those files are only sourced when starting X via startx
Apr 18 20:45:04 <kk4ewt>	zaccanasta; yes but you are starting gdm which is wayland by default
Apr 18 20:45:20 <kk4ewt>	grab something other than gnome and text
Apr 18 20:45:55 <zaccanasta>	kk4ewt: what if i start gdm on X11?
Apr 18 20:47:41 <kk4ewt>	are you?
Apr 18 20:51:38 <zaccanasta>	i changed it now, let's see
Apr 18 20:55:18 <M_aD>	dowdle: when is the go/nogo meeting for fedora 32?
Apr 18 20:56:30 <dowdle>	M_aD: It was last Thursday.
Apr 18 20:56:36 <dowdle>	M_aD: And it was a no-go.
Apr 18 20:56:51 <dowdle>	M_aD: I'll have to check the schedule to see when the next one is.

Apr 18 20:57:20 <dowdle>	I can't get there because my DNS is being very weird.
Apr 18 20:57:51 <tnelis>	(Next thursday yes.)
Apr 18 20:58:03 <M_aD>	tnelis: thanks
Apr 18 21:22:57 <zaccanasta>	oh well, kwm is messing up with my wifi driver
Apr 18 21:23:24 <Khaytsus>	How so

Apr 18 22:09:15 <schmuck>	not large but very long man boobs.
Apr 18 22:09:39 <schmuck>	AndyCap and andy|, read the above.
Apr 18 22:09:55 <zaccanasta>	cool, there's an "autostart" patch that works well
Apr 18 22:10:25 <schmuck>	zaccanasta: yep. SO what do you think about the informatoin that I provided above?
Apr 18 22:11:35 <zaccanasta>	schmuck: what did I miss?
Apr 18 22:11:58 <nauticalnexus>	zaccanasta: ignore them
Apr 18 22:12:26 <zaccanasta>	nauticalnexus: I guess

Apr 19 00:13:55 <Taim>	dnf history is an option.
Apr 19 00:14:39 <golanv1>	I would use dnf history also. If it isn't listed there, it's probably a dependency you shouldn't remove.

Apr 19 10:45:04 <cr0ssw1nd>	I have a fresh installation of Fedora on my old laptop
Apr 19 10:45:32 <cr0ssw1nd>	so far so good, but something is wrong with DNS resolving when I connect WiFi
Apr 19 10:46:14 <cr0ssw1nd>	 /etc/resolv.conf get only 1 dns server
Apr 19 10:46:34 <cr0ssw1nd>	though I set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 via nm-connection-editor

Apr 19 13:01:09 <FranciscoD>	jezebel: they're used for organisation, but generally not used by end-users
Apr 19 13:01:18 <FranciscoD>	use `dnf grouplist --hidden` to list them
Apr 19 13:01:21 <FranciscoD>	etc.
Apr 19 13:12:53 <miku>	FranciscoD, tnelis, I would like to solict your opinions if you'd be so kind as to spare the time
Apr 19 13:13:11 <miku>	the program: https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte
Apr 19 13:13:51 <miku>	seeing as the version listed in that changelog hasn't been bumped for 11 years, I'm tempted to assume it's B.S by this point in time
Apr 19 13:14:46 <miku>	name: gambatte-sdl, version: 0.4.1, release: 1.20200308git56e3371
Apr 19 13:15:20 <miku>	I feel I shouldn't use 0.1.20200308git... as it isn't explicitly stated to be a prerelease
Apr 19 13:15:33 <FranciscoD>	best to ask upstream
Apr 19 13:15:56 <FranciscoD>	these can be considered as post-release snapshots, or pre-release
Apr 19 13:16:02 <FranciscoD>	depends on what upstream's plans are
Apr 19 13:16:33 <FranciscoD>	either case will work for the package: the idea is that the version-release bits always increase, so that the "upgrade path" is maintained
Apr 19 13:16:46 <miku>	upstream = author of program?
Apr 19 13:17:03 <FranciscoD>	yes, the developers are "upstream"
Apr 19 13:17:18 <FranciscoD>	we package maintainers and linux distributions are "downstream" of them
Apr 19 13:17:33 <FranciscoD>	(like a river: developers are the source, and we're all downstream from the source)
Apr 19 13:17:43 <FranciscoD>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects
Apr 19 13:17:55 <miku>	gotcha
Apr 19 13:19:17 <miku>	suppose I make 3 changes to 0.4.1, so fooapp-0.4.1-1.blabla, 0.4.1-2.blala, 0.4.1-3.blabla
Apr 19 13:19:38 <FranciscoD>	yes, then when a new release comes out, you get 0.4.1-...
Apr 19 13:19:40 <FranciscoD>	er
Apr 19 13:19:43 <FranciscoD>	0.4.2-...
Apr 19 13:19:47 <miku>	then comes 0.4.2, do I go 0.4.2-1.blabla or continue 0.4.2-4.blabla?
Apr 19 13:19:48 <FranciscoD>	so the upgrade will be OK
Apr 19 13:19:57 <soda2[m]1>	i have one question - why updating by gnome-software is so slow? when i use dnf all is ok
Apr 19 13:19:58 <FranciscoD>	no, the release can be reset for each version
Apr 19 13:20:08 <miku>	great!
Apr 19 13:20:12 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: define "slow"?
Apr 19 13:20:13 <miku>	I am happy when I learn new things
Apr 19 13:20:32 <FranciscoD>	miku: reading the guidelines is a good start, lots of information there
Apr 19 13:20:42 <soda2[m]1>	5-10 minutes of searching packages to update for example
Apr 19 13:21:02 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: it downloads the metadata, then checks for updates
Apr 19 13:21:08 <FranciscoD>	dnf runs a timer that updates the cache periodically
Apr 19 13:21:24 <soda2[m]1>	yup, but why so slow? when i use dnf or yum everything is fast
Apr 19 13:21:58 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: if you use `sudo dnf --refresh` it'll also take time: it'll download the metadata again
Apr 19 13:22:16 <soda2[m]1>	because of this gnome-software seems broken
Apr 19 13:22:21 <miku>	FranciscoD, guideline documents tend to be too dense for community outsides to grasp on their first few tries...
Apr 19 13:22:22 <soda2[m]1>	in my opinion
Apr 19 13:23:06 <FranciscoD>	miku: there are lots of other documents: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package for example
Apr 19 13:23:18 <FranciscoD>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers is step by step
Apr 19 13:23:44 <miku>	a lot like manpages in that they are helpful when you already know a program and seek to improve your utilization of it
Apr 19 13:23:54 <miku>	but very frustrating and not much use when you are new to program
Apr 19 13:24:08 <FranciscoD>	miku: depends on the man page: most contain examples, which are great for beginners
Apr 19 13:24:26 <FranciscoD>	also depends on the person :)
Apr 19 13:24:47 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: file bugs, provide information, the developers will see what can be done to improve the user experience
Apr 19 13:25:12 <miku>	I definitely do have somewhat of those TL;DR genes
Apr 19 13:27:46 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Maybe try using pkcon which is a CLI for PackageKit, which is the component behind GNOME Software (if you observe noticably better perf you could exclude PK and focus on the GNOME Software, otherwise it could be a problem in either of these)
Apr 19 13:29:03 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Note that apparently (per Wikipedia) PK might use hawkey/librepo directly (i.e. not via DNF), meaning it's very possible there are differences between both as you observe.
Apr 19 13:30:44 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: One example you could check: Support for Zchunk added in F30 <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Zchunk_Metadata>. This improved perf immensely for me with DNF, but I'm not sure if it's supported by PK/GNOME Software -- so if not it could explain what you're observing.
Apr 19 13:32:31 <soda2[m]1>	i was traying run gnome-software by terminal command to check logs but i noticed memory error ;/ probably i cant run this program in terminal
Apr 19 13:33:32 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Actually that might help figure it out. What kind of error? An OOM condition?
Apr 19 13:34:16 <soda2[m]1>	Memory protection violation
Apr 19 13:34:26 <soda2[m]1>	i think this is not related
Apr 19 13:35:02 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Well if you have some time it'd be great if you could report it still. Regardless of whether you're launching from the CLI or the shell it shouldn't happen.
Apr 19 13:35:12 <soda2[m]1>	probably conflict with running dnf/yum/gnome-software
Apr 19 13:35:46 <soda2[m]1>	an you try run gnome-software by terminal?
Apr 19 13:36:06 <soda2[m]1>	i think you cannot do that, just like me
Apr 19 13:36:47 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: I'll reinstall it and check, but again this shouldn't result in memory violation (that's usually wording for segmentation faults).
Apr 19 13:37:53 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Assuming it's a subprocess, and nondeterministic, and the app retries repeatedly, then with a little imagination it could also explain your issue (I know, lots of assumptions, but just sayin' ;P)
Apr 19 13:38:32 <soda2[m]1>	hmm, i wondering how i can check what is up with that wihout command output xd
Apr 19 13:39:31 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Well again try pkcon, that would give you a chance to split to search in two and exclude one half.
Apr 19 13:45:22 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Also use pkmon (while using GNOME Software and pkcon) to monitor PackageKit events/transactions.
Apr 19 13:45:46 <soda2[m]1>	updates check in pkcon is fast too so this is not related
Apr 19 13:46:02 <soda2[m]1>	ok i will check it
Apr 19 13:46:43 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Interesting, so it's pkmon + GNOME Software might yield something interesting. For the record I tried launching GNOME Software from the CLI, no problem on my machine, definitely no memory violation.
Apr 19 13:48:20 <soda2[m]1>	yup! pkmon can show me output so we have step one :D
Apr 19 13:54:25 <soda2[m]1>	now when i run software-gnome updating is short and i cant reproduce issue. ;/
Apr 19 13:54:36 <soda2[m]1>	but i know how check it in future :) thx
Apr 19 13:55:37 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Given launching it from the CLI is supposed to work, it'be extra cool if you could file that memory violation if you still have the log! Otherwise yes, would have to wait until it reappears.
Apr 19 13:56:30 <soda2[m]1>	ahhh probably i know what is the problem with terminal running
Apr 19 13:56:49 <soda2[m]1>	when i use suda i recive memory valation
Apr 19 13:56:53 <soda2[m]1>	sudo*
Apr 19 13:57:13 <soda2[m]1>	but when i enter just gnome-software all is right
Apr 19 13:58:08 <tnelis>	Ah, alrighty!
Apr 19 13:58:44 <soda2[m]1>	thanks a lot :)
Apr 19 15:51:35 <jim87>	Hello! I'm having an issue with an intel I211 ethernet port. On windows I'm able to connect to the router with a 1000Mbps connection, but on linux I'm only able to reach 100mbps
Apr 19 15:51:44 <jim87>	How can I sort this out?
Apr 19 15:56:14 <jim87>	Somehow autoneg was off and set to 100 Mbps... I've now set autoneg still to off, but 1000 Mbps

Apr 19 16:34:19 <bitlord>	Hi, have some complex question regarding networking seutp. I have an old box which I use as a hypervisor it has two interfaces in two networks (wifi goes outside), and lan which is used locally. I'm using libvirt and used default firewalld rules. Now I want access to that box and to VMs inside virtual network, to do that I changed default firewalld zone for `virtbr0` to `dmz`, that did solve one issue, but now VMs cannot go to the internet using
Apr 19 16:34:19 <bitlord>	that wifi interface. Is there any easy guide on how to achieve something similar?
Apr 19 16:45:46 <securerootd>	hello
Apr 19 17:18:07 <jidar>	I just switched over to systemd-resolved, did a few things like enable DNSOverTLS, disable DNSSEC, and now I'm trying to understand why something like ping takes forever (roughly 10s) to being pinging my local address. All things point to working, valid, and speedy DNS responses timing dig against 127.0.0.53, and resolvectl query take far less than 1 second; running strace -w, shows me poll is
Apr 19 17:18:09 <jidar>	waiting 99.9% of the time, and I note that eventually it calls out to: connect(5, {sa_family=AF_UNIX, sun_path="/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket"}, 110) = 0; but this is > 10 seconds
Apr 19 17:18:59 <jidar>	the same can not be said for ping -6, against the same address
Apr 19 17:24:33 <bitlord>	does `ping -n` do the same?
Apr 19 17:26:22 <jidar>	> time ping b-wing.local -c 1 -n 1
Apr 19 17:26:28 <jidar>	> real    0m20.014s
Apr 19 17:26:40 <jidar>	> time resolvectl query b-wing.local
Apr 19 17:26:46 <jidar>	> real    0m0.012s
Apr 19 17:28:07 <bitlord>	oh, I thought you were pinging local IP directly not DNS and I was thinking some reverse lookup maybe took that much :(
Apr 19 17:28:34 <jidar>	oh!
Apr 19 17:28:54 <jidar>	yeah, I was reading the man page on that going, hurm, not sure what this will do lol
Apr 19 17:29:44 <jidar>	time ping -c 1 -6 b-wing.local -> real    0m0.846s
Apr 19 17:29:46 <jidar>	just as a FYI
Apr 19 17:44:34 <jidar>	ok, it was LLMNR
Apr 19 17:44:44 <jidar>	MulticastDNS seems quick, but LLMNR is super super slow
Apr 19 18:07:10 <soda2[m]1>	i have one question. i am going to buy someking server (hp or lenovo probably). i want to create home lab for learning openstack,openshift,ansible is there something I should pay special attention to? from your experience?
Apr 19 18:07:48 <soda2[m]1>	buy somekind*
Apr 19 18:21:36 <ledeni>	soda2[m], check topic of the channel --> /topic
Apr 19 18:32:43 <kk4ewt>	soda2[m]; lots of cpu power (lots of processors min 16) and at least 1-2G of ram per processor (min 32G) and it most be able to do virtualization
Apr 19 18:33:10 <kk4ewt>	and with that lots of storage space for VMs
Apr 19 18:33:25 <\n3p\>	jidar, what dns server do you use?
Apr 19 18:35:59 <kk4ewt>	soda2[m] take a look at "https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/ "

Apr 19 19:17:35 <Bayesian_Coffee>	getting an error when trying to use GUI GNOME Software Update: `Unable to download updates: could not do untrusted question as no klass support`
Apr 19 19:17:35 <Bayesian_Coffee>	a quick Google search reveals that this has something to do with the repo mirrors being out of sync? what's up with that? why would that not work while `# dnf update` would?
Apr 19 19:22:42 <Mac101>	anyone got any suggestions for a really cheap/small portable device to run fedora on?
Apr 19 19:50:48 <Taim>	Raspberry PI
Apr 19 19:51:21 <Taim>	Just not a PI 4 quite yet.
Apr 19 20:08:07 <golanv1>	No Pi4 yet?
Apr 19 20:08:43 <Foxfir3>	Silverblue. How to go about Wine?
Apr 19 20:09:14 <Foxfir3>	Should wine be run from a toolbox?
Apr 19 20:14:38 <Taim>	Golanv: PI 4, It...works-ish....on Fedora 32...sort of.  It still needs some time to mature there, imo.
Apr 19 20:21:08 <golanv1>	Oh I see.
Apr 19 20:21:24 <golanv1>	I don't have one (yet).
Apr 19 20:33:07 <Foxfir3>	so all the guys who were on IRC at work, are now watching Netflix?
Apr 19 20:33:54 <Foxfir3>	third Silverblue install. in doubt now. Almost no documentation. IRC channel almost dead silent.
Apr 19 20:34:33 <Foxfir3>	its things like how to install Wine that makes it frustrating. Am I supposed to dump all those packages into the ostree?
Apr 19 20:35:16 <bitlord>	probably just not many people here use Silverblue :(
Apr 19 20:37:03 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: okay. Maybe I invested too early in Silverblue. Its a great idea, but so many things are shaky. Like broken Flatpaks. Seems like there are no money behind the project, and no one writing documentation. I would offer my help, but the Fedora community seems closed.
Apr 19 20:37:56 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, have you tried on mailing lists?
Apr 19 20:38:22 <Foxfir3>	And there is the Gnome bleatware. I dont get the meaning of that. Silverblue is definately not for beginners, so why Gnome? Why not some desktop that is easy to remove.
Apr 19 20:38:28 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: I didnt know there was a mailing list. Maybe I should I should try that
Apr 19 20:39:18 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: Who is paying for Fedora?
Apr 19 20:39:40 <caterfxo>	red hat sponsors it
Apr 19 20:39:47 <caterfxo>	o-rt
Apr 19 20:39:57 <Foxfir3>	okay. So thats the trouble. There is money behind CoreOS, but not Silverblue.
Apr 19 20:41:12 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/contribute I hope those are valid still
Apr 19 20:41:56 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, so it seems there is a forum like platform, instead of mailing list
Apr 19 20:43:24 <tnelis>	Yeah I receive digests from the community forum, most of the discussion is about Silverblue.

Apr 20 10:24:40 <[Enrico]>	gintonyc: depends what you want to do
Apr 20 10:24:51 <[Enrico]>	for normal desktop I would say it's a very bad idea
Apr 20 10:27:52 <gintonyc>	Yes, its on a desktop.
Apr 20 11:52:29 <plarsen>	gintonyc, unplug it from the network?
Apr 20 12:04:26 <gouf>	how to make fedora use xorg instead of wayalnd ?
Apr 20 12:06:18 <bitlord>	gouf, if you ask about fedora workstation, on the login you can select gnome on xorg session

Apr 20 14:01:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	gintonyc, why do you want to disable all outgoing traffic
Apr 20 14:02:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	gintonyc, plarsen was basicly saying if yo disable all outgoing traffic you dont need a network connection

Apr 20 14:37:03 <corshmock>	It's for Nicotine+
Apr 20 14:41:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	all outgoing connections should open incoming
Apr 20 14:43:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: mmmmm.  I'm getting IP: 78.16.51.68 Port: 15000/tcp CLOSED
Apr 20 14:44:25 <Khaytsus>	You sure your ISP isn't doing it?
Apr 20 14:44:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  so open the port in your firewall
Apr 20 14:45:10 <Khaytsus>	Some ISPs block p2p ports etc
Apr 20 14:51:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, what Desktop environment are you using
Apr 20 14:55:05 <corshmock>	Khaytsus: not sure pal
Apr 20 14:55:36 <corshmock>	Is it a firewalkd command?  Sorry I'm quite new to Linux?
Apr 20 14:56:02 <corshmock>	I'm on Fedora 31
Apr 20 15:00:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 20 15:02:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, give us the output url of that command
Apr 20 15:07:15 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/25915cf8
Apr 20 15:08:00 <corshmock>	That's a neat command
Apr 20 15:10:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  so you are using gnome
Apr 20 15:10:49 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: apologies, I wasn't sure
Apr 20 15:11:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, fedora has many desktop environments thats why i asked you your answer should of been gnome or workstation
Apr 20 15:11:46 <linuxkeitaro>	thank @FranciscoD
Apr 20 15:12:23 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: I get you.  So does the command vary from one environment to another?
Apr 20 15:12:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 20 15:12:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well i am going to instruct in using the gui
Apr 20 15:15:25 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: is the gui standard part of the os?
Apr 20 15:15:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Apr 20 15:15:52 <corshmock>	Lovely
Apr 20 15:16:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	soon as i can find it in gnome
Apr 20 15:16:14 <gintonyc>	Southern Gentlem: It was just to control the outgoing connection
Apr 20 15:16:37 <corshmock>	Can I search for it in apps?
Apr 20 15:18:31 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: What are yo ulooking for, the firewalld gui?
Apr 20 15:18:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 20 15:18:54 <Khaytsus>	Isn't it just firewall-config
Apr 20 15:19:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	not comeing up in the live
Apr 20 15:19:35 <Khaytsus>	Dunno.  I don't keep a WS VM on hand, makes me queasy it just being on disk.
Apr 20 15:19:46 <corshmock>	I've found Firewall Configuration - not installed yet
Apr 20 15:20:13 <corshmock>	Should I install it?
Apr 20 15:20:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats strange
Apr 20 15:20:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  hold on a few
Apr 20 15:20:33 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: sure
Apr 20 15:20:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, what did you use to install your fedora
Apr 20 15:21:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am installing in a vm to see whats up
Apr 20 15:21:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: Oh dear, I can't remember, but I think I know what you mean.  gui should be in standard build?
Apr 20 15:21:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	from getfedora or the updated isos in the topic
Apr 20 15:22:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: Sorry, I don't understand
Apr 20 15:23:41 <Khaytsus>	I doubt that matters Southern_Gentlem
Apr 20 15:23:53 <Khaytsus>	But odd that firewall-config isn't in the base ks
Apr 20 15:25:12 <corshmock>	The firewall configuration tool in software gets very good reviews!
Apr 20 15:25:24 <corshmock>	Should I install it?
Apr 20 15:25:52 <Khaytsus>	dnf install firewall-config
Apr 20 15:26:28 <ohmyfish>	hi .. sry short question .. it's gnome related .. is there a way to reduce the size of the symbols (overview - on the left - gnome panel (i do not want to use an extension .. like dash2panel ect ..)?  per css or something else..
Apr 20 15:26:40 <Khaytsus>	It's installed here though...  so..  I'm a bit confused why it wouldn't be in WS
Apr 20 15:26:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	no
Apr 20 15:26:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	ohmyfish, no
Apr 20 15:27:09 <ohmyfish>	uh .. ok thx southern
Apr 20 15:27:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	its gnome you have to use the tweaktool and an extension
Apr 20 15:27:36 <corshmock>	That's installed now
Apr 20 15:28:08 <corshmock>	and running now
Apr 20 15:28:14 <ohmyfish>	yep, but i can't change the size per tweaks & i do not want to install dash2panel .. to many extensions
Apr 20 15:28:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, ok f2 type firewall
Apr 20 15:28:43 <corshmock>	f2 type firewall
Apr 20 15:28:53 <corshmock>	?
Apr 20 15:28:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	press f2
Apr 20 15:29:11 <dowdle>	alt+f2?
Apr 20 15:29:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	f2
Apr 20 15:29:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	or the windows key
Apr 20 15:29:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	or click applications at the top left
Apr 20 15:30:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	dowdle, **tag your it*
Apr 20 15:30:18 *	Southern_Gentlem runs away
Apr 20 15:30:19 <corshmock>	I've got firewall configuration running.  Sorry nothing happening on f2 or windows key
Apr 20 15:31:53 <corshmock>	Should I add port 15000 (the one that's closed)?
Apr 20 15:32:09 <Khaytsus>	I thought you just clicked the applications text at the top, because ya know, that's obvious user design
Apr 20 15:32:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  you need 2234
Apr 20 15:32:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	tcp open that under public
Apr 20 15:32:44 <corshmock>	Yep
Apr 20 15:33:51 <corshmock>	I've added 2234 into ports, but it isn't showing up.  No errors
Apr 20 15:37:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	2234 select tcp enter
Apr 20 15:37:41 <corshmock>	So I've added that into public
Apr 20 15:37:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	and restart the firewall
Apr 20 15:37:50 <corshmock>	and it's showing up as entered
Apr 20 15:37:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	now test with nicotine
Apr 20 15:40:40 <corshmock>	I add the port, then reload firewalld, and the port disappears.  Still not connecting in nicotine+
Apr 20 15:41:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the firewall select permanet
Apr 20 15:41:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	public
Apr 20 15:41:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	port 2234 tcp
Apr 20 15:42:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, why have you not updated this computer in over a month
Apr 20 15:42:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	you are still on the 5.4 kernel
Apr 20 15:45:29 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: afraid that it might break :(  Do you update regularly?
Apr 20 15:46:06 <corshmock>	So I've restarted with systemctl restart firewall d, but still no joy
Apr 20 15:46:53 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: That is funny, firewall-config is not on the WS spin, but is on XFCE.  That seems quite odd.  Maybe gnome has some other specific firewall tool I'm unaware of?
Apr 20 15:49:18 <corshmock>	It's not saving the port I add.  If I restart firewalld, or the firewall config app, port 2234 disappears
Apr 20 15:49:35 <corshmock>	I wonder could I add 2234 through cli?
Apr 20 15:50:17 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps you didn't tell it persistent or whatever it is in firewalld
Apr 20 15:51:13 <corshmock>	Ah
Apr 20 15:51:24 <corshmock>	Does anyone know the exact command?
Apr 20 15:51:33 <jidar>	--permanent
Apr 20 15:52:02 <jidar>	which doesn't make it immediate, you need to restart it after that iirc
Apr 20 15:53:37 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it was my understanding that the "gui tools" for administration was part of Cockpit now ... now specific to a DE?
Apr 20 15:53:54 <plarsen>	s/now specific/not specific/
Apr 20 15:55:14 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: huh..  interesting.  Let me look
Apr 20 15:56:55 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: I wonder how one discovers cockpit.  It's not a default link in Firefox, it's not in the menus, etc
Apr 20 15:57:31 <Khaytsus>	And cockpit isn't enabled by default anyway
Apr 20 15:57:34 <plarsen>	It's definitely a separate install; like so many other things, it's stuff you need to understand
Apr 20 15:57:37 <plarsen>	to ue
Apr 20 15:57:38 <plarsen>	use*
Apr 20 15:57:43 <plarsen>	grrr - fingers are on strike!
Apr 20 15:57:44 <corshmock>	sudo firewall-cmd --zone=dmz --add-port=2234/tcp --permanent - success
Apr 20 15:58:08 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: So no I can't imagine they'd use that as the default administration since it isn't even installed.  Being able to adjust a firewall seems like a pretty common thing to me for users.
Apr 20 15:58:09 <corshmock>	But systemctl restart firewalld fail - timeout
Apr 20 15:58:18 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps less than it used to be, with firewall and dynamic ports etc, but
Apr 20 15:58:20 <plarsen>	That said, Cockpit has definitely been enhanced a lot over the last few years - tons of articles and more to explain how to use it.
Apr 20 15:58:47 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: I am not really referring to cockpits function/disfunction, rather its end-user discoverability.  How would a user even know to use it.
Apr 20 15:59:07 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it's a question if you need to reinvent the wheel for every DE and even a TUI interface, or have a single web interface that works regardless of how you have things installed/setup
Apr 20 15:59:47 <plarsen>	I'm sure something could be done to help users to find it. Red Hat definitely uses Cockpit to show how 'user friendly'  RHEL is to a Windows user.
Apr 20 15:59:59 <plarsen>	That said - I rarely use it .... :D
Apr 20 16:00:12 <Khaytsus>	If it's replacing the GUI tools, then it should be installed by default and have links in the menus.  That simple.
Apr 20 16:01:24 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, most of the GUI tools we used to have are gone. With the exception of NetworkManager, you don't have GUI tools for partitioning, boot management, DE configuration etc.  the few that we have, are ancient left-overs?
Apr 20 16:01:55 <Khaytsus>	Given most of those arne't needed anymore...
Apr 20 16:02:03 <Khaytsus>	gparted works fine for partitions, the rest.. useless
Apr 20 16:02:23 <plarsen>	I haven't used GUI tools to configure a server for ages ...
Apr 20 16:02:40 <plarsen>	So I can only tell you I don't see the tools listed anymore when I look for packages
Apr 20 16:03:17 <plarsen>	Fedora used to have an admin menu with all kinds of "control panel" gui apps for everything from users, networking, disks etc.
Apr 20 16:03:28 <plarsen>	Do anyone use the "disk administrator" gui??
Apr 20 16:03:35 <plarsen>	It's AWFUL ....
Apr 20 16:03:54 <plarsen>	Hasn't changed in a long long time
Apr 20 16:06:11 <Piston>	hi folks, I getting following error while connecting via nm , any pointers would help..
Apr 20 16:06:23 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it's announcements/requests like this I remember: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/CockpitManagementConsole

Apr 21 01:49:06 <gambl0re>	what's the most straight forward to install postgresql?
Apr 21 01:49:45 <Sokel>	dnf...
Apr 21 01:50:12 <plarsen>	gambl0re, dnf install postgresql
Apr 21 01:50:39 <plarsen>	ehhh + -server.. So, dnf install postgresql-server
Apr 21 01:50:46 <gambl0re>	is that all it takes? why am i reading docs online that i have to do all these other steps
Apr 21 01:51:15 <Sokel>	you install it, init the database, start it up.
Apr 21 01:51:16 <Sokel>	done
Apr 21 01:51:17 <plarsen>	Depends on what exactly you want, the type of features, libraries you need available to different programming languages etc.
Apr 21 01:52:02 <gambl0re>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PostgreSQL
Apr 21 01:52:17 <mutk>	gambl0re, https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/database/postgresql/about.html     is best.
Apr 21 01:52:26 <mutk>	Its a good recipe
Apr 21 01:53:00 <gambl0re>	mutk: thanks
Apr 21 01:53:47 <gambl0re>	if i run this command...$ sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
Apr 21 01:54:00 <gambl0re>	what's the difference if i just did $ dnf install postgresql?
Apr 21 01:54:45 <Sokel>	you need sudo unless you're running the command as root, obviously.
Apr 21 01:55:16 <gambl0re>	i'm not talking about sudo.
Apr 21 01:55:26 <gambl0re>	postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
Apr 21 01:55:59 <mutk>	postgresql-server   is the SERVER package.  postgresql-contrib  is a package that has a lot of useful contributed tools for postgres.
Apr 21 01:57:07 <gambl0re>	does dnf install postgresql include both server and contrib?
Apr 21 01:57:15 <mutk>	gambl0re, I don't know
Apr 21 01:57:16 <Sokel>	no, it doesn't.
Apr 21 01:57:31 <mutk>	gambl0re,   dnf info postgresql-contrib         have a look
Apr 21 01:57:33 <Sokel>	dnf info explains that postgresql is not the server package.
Apr 21 01:57:34 <gambl0re>	then why wouldnt the docs just say to do 'dnf install postgresql'?
Apr 21 01:58:22 <Sokel>	the postgresql package is for the client portion.
Apr 21 01:58:29 <plarsen>	gambl0re, because that's not the database. That's tools/software to connect and use database
Apr 21 01:58:33 <Sokel>	Summary      : PostgreSQL client programs
Apr 21 01:59:17 <Sokel>	dnf info postgresql-server: Summary      : The programs needed to create and run a PostgreSQL server
Apr 21 02:02:16 <gambl0re>	is postgresql-server the actual postgres database?
Apr 21 02:02:38 <gambl0re>	im confused with which packages to install. there's postgres postgres-contrib postgres-server postgres-client
Apr 21 02:02:49 <gambl0re>	i just want to install postgres db on my computer
Apr 21 02:02:53 <mutk>	gambl0re, dnf info  tells you
Apr 21 02:03:22 <mutk>	You have already had this explained :0
Apr 21 02:03:31 <gambl0re>	ok nevermind. thanks anyways
Apr 21 02:03:36 <plarsen>	gambl0re, you can see what each package contains like this: https://paste.centos.org/view/65bddbb6
Apr 21 02:04:19 <gambl0re>	yea i get. what makes me confused is when i do a google search on how to install postgres i'll get like 4 different answers
Apr 21 02:04:51 <plarsen>	Welcome to Linux - where having one way to do things is NEVER good enough :D
Apr 21 02:05:45 <plarsen>	gambl0re, you need to consider the distribution, when things were written up (things change) and what the actual goal is.  Some guides assume a specific type of installation/setup of the database and include more stuff than you may need to
Apr 21 02:05:56 <gambl0re>	plarsen: you use centos?
Apr 21 02:06:04 <plarsen>	Among others, yes
Apr 21 02:06:08 <gambl0re>	but why?
Apr 21 02:07:03 <Sokel>	...because it's an enterprise distro?
Apr 21 02:09:17 <plarsen>	gambl0re, one of the reasons I found Linux so helpful back in the days was that it's not just done one way. There are options for EVERYTHING.   Not just between distributions, but within them. It makes it possible for you to pick the right tool for the right project
Apr 21 02:10:21 <plarsen>	I use Fedora every day on my workstations. It's very current with things, I get to use great virtualization and containerization tools right out of the standard/official repos.  With CentOS I know what I design today will work 5 years from now. Unmodified (well, people probably wouldn't use it if I didn't keep it up to date though)
Apr 21 02:23:09 <sonik_hex>	plarsen, that pastebin is a great example of a dnf search.  very useful
Apr 21 02:24:57 <gambl0re>	how do i search packages in rpm fusion?
Apr 21 02:25:46 <gambl0re>	anyone know how i can install pgadmin, i dont see it in software management when i searched
Apr 21 02:26:14 <plarsen>	gambl0re, install the repo(s) and use the command I showed you. You can add --enablerepo and --disablerepo to control which repos it will query
Apr 21 02:27:12 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Did you _really_ look? ;) <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/s/pgadmin>
Apr 21 02:27:51 <zuvy>	gambl0re: rtfm
Apr 21 02:28:10 <gambl0re>	tnelis: yea when i searched in software manager for pgadmin, it returned empty
Apr 21 02:28:58 <gambl0re>	https://i.imgur.com/5c8Aj8v.png
Apr 21 02:29:06 <gambl0re>	just in case you don't believe me
Apr 21 02:31:03 <Sokel>	https://paste.centos.org/view/a5a76c27
Apr 21 02:32:40 <zuvy>	You cannot trust output from KDE Discovery or from Gnoma Software, do a real dnf search
Apr 21 02:32:54 <gambl0re>	zuvy: why not?
Apr 21 02:32:59 <sonik_hex>	gambl0re, $ dnf search pgadmin
Apr 21 02:33:10 <Sokel>	pgadmin3 is the package.
Apr 21 02:33:21 <Sokel>	I would never rely on the software centers of a DE, ever.
Apr 21 02:33:23 <sonik_hex>	gambl0re, $ dnf info pgadmin3.x86_64
Apr 21 02:33:59 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Indeed. I think not all packages are considered "applications" as in "AppStream" apps. It's not a question of trust or anything IMO; it's just that they're like "app stores", not for low-level components/packages or server software.
Apr 21 02:34:23 <zuvy>	gambl0re: years decades of use
Apr 21 02:34:52 *	sonik_hex nods
Apr 21 02:36:17 <gambl0re>	zuvy: oh
Apr 21 02:36:50 <zuvy>	gambl0re: see tnelis comment above
Apr 21 02:37:57 <tnelis>	gambl0re: I just realized pgAdmin 4 is not packaged yet, yet that's perhaps the only one with a Qt implementation. If pgAdmin 3 is strictly a web application (which I think it is), then it would explain why it doesn't appear in "app stores" (it requires server components that don't fit the traditional app model).
Apr 21 02:39:20 <tnelis>	gambl0re: This would be a good fit for a flatpak, but I don't see any on Flathub, you might be out-of-luck if you want the latest version outside of third-party repos (Copr has a couple you might want to check out <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=pgadmin>).
Apr 21 02:39:28 <gambl0re>	is pgadmin 4 better than pgadmin3?
Apr 21 02:40:42 <tnelis>	gambl0re: I don't know, I'm kind of a psql guy myself ;). I would imagine there are improvements yes, though of course a version bump does not _always_ means strictly better.
Apr 21 02:41:39 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Actually, check this out <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771823>; it seems it's no longer supported upstream so yeah, the situation is not ideal right now.

Apr 21 18:20:42 <grant>	installing gtk3 downgrades glib2 on fedora 32, is there a way around this?
Apr 21 18:23:09 <Khaytsus>	dowdle: Well, that was easy, I had to delete the pool I'd set up for my custom location and the "default" pool, then just recreate 'default' at my custom path.  Pretty trivial, no data loss or moving or such
Apr 21 18:24:04 <Khaytsus>	Be niceer if there were just a "default" flag, not literally "default" as the name of the pool
Apr 21 18:24:07 <Khaytsus>	but ah well

Apr 22 12:40:14 <DaFiN>	hi
Apr 22 13:19:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	@f32release
Apr 22 13:19:52 <fedbot>	Fedora 32 is planned for release on 2020-04-28, which is 6 days, 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds from now
Apr 22 14:37:49 <SeeM2>	I already upgrade to 32 on desktops and vps and screwed only one thing: Python version changed, which broke virtualenv and backend for a simple webpage was not feeding new data. :) And certbot warned me about expiring certificates, since it did not renewed them automaticcaly. Upgrade process was very clean and simple. The only thing I didn't like is how dnf handles appstreams during system update. It's a
Apr 22 14:37:55 <SeeM2>	known issue and among wild proposals for Fedora 33
Apr 22 14:53:44 <ikonia>	in F31 I'm on a host with one physical network interface, I'm considering making two bridge devices hanging off the single physical interfaces
Apr 22 14:54:20 <ikonia>	normally I do this on servers with the bridge config files in the sysconfig/network-scripts section, but I'm wondering if there is anyway to do this with the network manager gui in F31 ?
Apr 22 14:54:54 <ikonia>	also is there any issues with the primary IP being on a bridge device rather than the physical interface, I cant' think of any, but I've never had reason to put it on a bridge device before
Apr 22 14:59:03 <rationaltech>	ikonia You can have the primary IP be on a bridge in most cases a bridge has the physical ports IP in it anyway since that's what you're doing...making a bridge and a one way bridge wouldn't be super useful unless all you wanted to do was monitor.  No idea on the network manager bit.
Apr 22 15:01:20 <ikonia>	rationaltech: not quite,
Apr 22 15:02:02 <ikonia>	rationaltech: my use case is I'm running and hold workstation while I'm at home as a kvm host, it only has one interface on it, so I want to put all VM's against the bridge so that they are exposed to the network with a network IP and just use the interface as a pass through
Apr 22 15:02:18 <ikonia>	for this to work the interface can't have it's own ip
Apr 22 15:02:20 <ikonia>	so I'd need a second bridge for the host to appear on the network
Apr 22 15:06:33 <akik>	ikonia: i've done it with the nmcli tool. would that help you? i've listed the commands i ran
Apr 22 15:16:00 <ikonia>	akik: tht would really help
Apr 22 15:16:05 <ikonia>	akik: did you have any problems with it ?
Apr 22 15:16:19 <ikonia>	(out of interest)
Apr 22 15:19:33 <akik>	ikonia: https://pastebin.com/raw/TLpSkW8F no problems, eth0 is on dhcp and eth1 on that static ip
Apr 22 15:19:50 <akik>	br0 and br1 that is
Apr 22 15:20:15 <akik>	somebody said they needed this option but i didn't need it
Apr 22 15:20:29 <akik>	nmcli connection modify eth0 connection.autoconnect yes
Apr 22 15:20:39 <ledeni>	ikonia: you can run 'nm-connection-editor' GUI not sure about setting up your network but you can look at
Apr 22 15:23:31 <akik>	ikonia: i use this setup to give a lxc container network access to both those network(s)
Apr 22 15:26:10 <fedorafan>	if you like q and would like to talk about it join ##qanon
Apr 22 15:26:36 <akik>	nice person
Apr 22 15:28:36 <ikonia>	akik: that sounds like a similar usecase for just a different reason, sounds like what I'm using for
Apr 22 15:29:31 <ikonia>	akik: looks really good, thank you
Apr 22 15:30:04 <ikonia>	ledeni: didn't know about nm-connection-editor either, thankyou
Apr 22 15:30:17 <akik>	i had to learn it because fedora 31 removed those network-scripts configs
Apr 22 15:30:26 <akik>	or was it fedora 30
Apr 22 15:37:33 <ledeni>	ikonia:you're welcome
Apr 22 16:03:38 <plundra>	Hmm, how do I run a polkit agent under sway? I only see a reference to polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 which doesn't seem tobe available.
Apr 22 16:04:36 <plundra>	I assume it's built into gnome or somehing now. So maybe ome other agent or way is possible?
Apr 22 16:05:07 <plundra>	Ah, lxpolkit was even installed, let me try that.
Apr 22 16:06:46 <plundra>	lxpolkit worked great. Let me add that to the startup :-)

Apr 22 16:52:14 <gintonyc>	Hi, in Grub2 / Fedora 31, it's not enough to put a GRUB_BACKGROUND in /etc/default/grub (and update command) ? Thanks
Apr 22 17:02:03 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Is this a new setup with a new image file?
Apr 22 17:02:18 <gintonyc>	Yes
Apr 22 17:02:50 <gintonyc>	New to Fedora, i thought grub has a background :D

Apr 22 17:11:40 <gintonyc>	sorry, i will try with PNG, thanks
Apr 22 17:11:41 <dowdle>	gintonyc: And I put it in /boot/grub2/themes/system/
Apr 22 17:12:23 <gintonyc>	and the parameter "GRUB_BACKGROUND=/boot/grub2/themes/system/background.PNG" on /etc/default/grub, yes ?
Apr 22 17:12:28 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Also, I think you need to comment out this line #GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
Apr 22 17:12:54 <gintonyc>	oh ok, i thought when you use a theme, not just a background, so it's sure, i didn't comment this line.
Apr 22 17:13:21 <dowdle>	gintonyc: I believe that line needs to be commented out for the background image to show up.
Apr 22 17:13:46 <gintonyc>	Ok thanks
Apr 22 17:18:00 <dowdle>	gintonyc: And of course, every time you change /etc/default/grub you need to rerun grub2-mkconfig with the proper parameters (depending on boot mode)
Apr 22 17:18:39 <gintonyc>	depending on boot mode ?
Apr 22 17:20:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	bios or efi
Apr 22 17:20:54 <gintonyc>	i'm on EFI
Apr 22 17:21:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	so what is the parameters for efi
Apr 22 17:24:23 <mrproper>	I'm using Fedora Cinnamon 31 in VMware Fusion and when I'm in the terminal and do an alt-left (or right) to move forward or back whole words, it prints D or C respectively instead of moving the cursor.
Apr 22 17:25:13 <gintonyc>	I update with this command : grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg and i see that i have another file "/etc/grub2-efi-.cfg" ! I think i didn't update the right file after my "nano /etc/default/grub"
Apr 22 17:26:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	thus the depending on boot mode
Apr 22 17:26:15 <dowdle>	gintonyc: If you are UEFI boot, It'd be the /etc/grub2-efi-.cfg
Apr 22 17:26:42 <dowdle>	 (which is a symlink to /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
Apr 22 17:26:44 <dowdle>	)
Apr 22 17:27:19 <gintonyc>	Ok so another reason it didn't work :D
Apr 22 17:27:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrproper, so are you in bash or in vim
Apr 22 17:27:57 <mrproper>	Southern_Gentlem: Bash, zsh really.
Apr 22 17:28:06 <mrproper>	Hmmmm it works in bash so zsh is broke.
Apr 22 17:28:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	or it has different setting
Apr 22 17:29:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	expecting zsh to act like bash is a PEBCAK to me
Apr 22 17:29:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suggest looking at the zsh documentation
Apr 22 17:29:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	then if it says that should work then file a bugzilla
Apr 22 17:33:17 <mrproper>	Southern_Gentlem: Control works so it's a different setting.
Apr 22 17:33:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	so it was a pebcak
Apr 22 17:35:13 <mrproper>	It wa.s

Apr 22 17:47:08 <unun>	Hello, I am just getting started with docker, and was trying to find a lightweight redhat based distro to base my container off of.
Apr 22 17:47:15 <unun>	I found atomic, which turned into CoreOS, which has now turned into a different CoreOS?
Apr 22 17:47:50 <unun>	But I am not even sure if coreos is an OS for container hosting, or to tuned to be hosted
Apr 22 17:47:55 <unun>	could anyone help clarify?
Apr 22 17:49:33 <plundra>	unun: It's to host the containers.
Apr 22 17:51:06 <akik>	unun: i use centos 7 as my docker host(s)
Apr 22 17:51:55 <akik>	centos 8 also works with some modifications
Apr 22 17:55:59 <unun>	Ah, ok. Is there a lightweight redhat distro that is specialized to be used as a container operating system? I am currently using fedora which is 400mb size wise. which isnt bad, but I would think there would be better out there, no?
Apr 22 18:00:34 <unun>	alpine by contrast is only 5 mb
Apr 22 18:03:14 <chncynic[m]>	Besides silverblue all others will be exactly as you know it
Apr 22 18:07:54 <unun>	ok. thanks
Apr 22 18:29:22 <gintonyc>	So i tried again to configure the background of Grub but nothing... I have an error message but i not have the time to see it... I can find a log somewhere ? boot.log begin with plymouth right ?
Apr 22 18:29:57 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Given that there is no OS / logger when in grub, I wouldn't think there is a way to get a log entry.
Apr 22 18:32:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	dmesg maybe
Apr 22 18:32:25 <gintonyc>	so i put a PNG in /boot/grub2/themes/system (i see 2 others PNG "background" and "fireworks". I put the paramater grub_background on /etc/default/grub. Launched the grub2-mkconfig for EFI. Its talk about the background... But it didn't work.. Maybe i will stay with the black style :D
Apr 22 18:34:15 <gintonyc>	I found nothing about grub in dmesg
Apr 22 18:36:45 <dowdle>	gintonyc: You might look into what limitations there are with images you can use.  I've not done it with UEFI.
Apr 22 18:36:51 <Sokel>	gintonyc: EFI?
Apr 22 18:36:57 <dowdle>	Sokel: Yep.
Apr 22 18:37:48 <gintonyc>	dowdle, i can try with background.png which is already in the system folder right ? If it's work, it's my image which has the problem.
Apr 22 18:43:16 <gintonyc>	Ok, i take a movie so i have the error message, same with the background.png ! "It's : error: ../../grub-core/fs/fshelp.c:257:file ` /EFI/fedora/locale/fr.gmo` not found"
Apr 22 18:44:00 <Sokel>	that is not related to backgrounds.
Apr 22 18:44:25 <gintonyc>	yeah but i didn't see this error before change the background :D
Apr 22 18:44:42 <Sokel>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1592124 doesn't matter.
Apr 22 18:46:12 <ledeni>	gintonyc: try this steps --> https://paste.centos.org/view/84d28230
Apr 22 18:46:23 <gintonyc>	I didn't have the locale folder xD
Apr 22 18:46:28 <Sokel>	https://paste.centos.org/view/5c96374b - this worked for me immediately.
Apr 22 18:48:25 <ledeni>	Sokel: :)
Apr 22 18:49:12 <dowdle>	Sokel: So you used gfxterm_background.mod for it and didn't use the line in /etc/default/grub?
Apr 22 18:51:41 <gintonyc>	Ok i followed the link, thanks. You know where i can find the locale folder ?
Apr 22 18:57:14 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Looks like it takes a bit more work with UEFI boot... but be that as it may... what locale folder?
Apr 22 18:58:15 <ledeni>	 gintonyc: copy "/boot/grub2/locale" to "/boot/efi/EFI/fedora/locale"
Apr 22 18:59:17 <gintonyc>	The problem is i don't have the folder locale in /boot/grub2
Apr 22 19:00:18 <gintonyc>	dowdle: the fr.gmo not found error

Apr 22 20:00:59 <omajid>	hey folks. is there a way to generate a list of members of a fas group automatically on the wiki? i would rather not have to maintain https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet#Members by hand :)
Apr 22 20:03:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	go into fas and cut and paste ?
Apr 22 20:03:29 <omajid>	well, manual operations like cut+paste is what i am trying to avoid
Apr 22 20:05:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	that group is small
Apr 22 20:05:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	omajid, #fedora-admin may can help
Apr 22 20:06:16 <omajid>	thanks
Apr 22 20:07:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	omajid, also you need to check with every group member that their info is on the webpage (some have private settings enabled in FAS)
Apr 22 20:10:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	is ok to have on the wiki rather
Apr 22 20:19:32 <dowdle>	How can I troubleshoot an sshd.service that is enabled but sometimes doesn't start on boot?
Apr 22 20:19:37 <dowdle>	I'm not seeing any log entries.
Apr 22 20:21:44 <dowdle>	The last log entry for it shows that it shutdown prior to me rebooting the system.
Apr 22 20:22:38 <omajid>	what does `systemctl status sshd.service` say?
Apr 22 20:23:51 <dowdle>	omajid: That is is enabled and not running.
Apr 22 20:24:40 <dowdle>	omajid: With the same last log entry.  No mention of a failure to start.  It just didn't.
Apr 22 20:25:00 <janos_>	dowdle: maybe check the boot log?
Apr 22 20:25:09 <janos_>	in /var/log/boot.log iirc
Apr 22 20:25:54 <dowdle>	Also, the stock sshd.service file has Restart=on-failure and RestartSec=42s
Apr 22 20:28:40 <dowdle>	janos_: Nothing relevant in the boot.log.  grep ssh /var/log/boot.log shows two lines, one for x2dkeygen.slice and the other for sshd-keygen.target
Apr 22 20:28:52 <janos_>	dang
Apr 22 20:29:07 <dowdle>	It's like it forgot to start and doesn't realize it isn't running... a double wammy.
Apr 22 20:41:32 <dowdle>	It's been doing this for a few months... maybe 1 out of 3 boots... started in F31... and still here in F32 pre-release.
Apr 22 20:41:38 <dowdle>	But that's the only system I've had the trouble with.

Apr 22 22:55:45 <Caterpillar>	do you know if there is an utility that shuts down the computer if it detects that the fan is running at 0 RPM? I need that because I have a liquid cooling system and the motherboard detects the pump RPM as if it is a regular fan
Apr 22 23:01:08 <tnelis>	Caterpillar: That's a good question. I don't know of any though somebody else might know more. Worst case you could hack something up quick quickly by polling with lm-sensors or something. All that being said, I don't know how easy it is to fry a modern CPU or GPU -- my understanding is that virtually every hardware package now has thermal safeties built-in (first with throttling then shutting down
Apr 22 23:01:14 <tnelis>	completely).
Apr 22 23:08:58 <Caterpillar>	tnelis: yes, but with a liquid cooling system, you may trigger liquid to go to boiling point, which can trigger cooling system to destroy

Apr 23 10:58:20 <stemid>	I have to keep the pavucontrol app running when I start MS Teams or Teams won't recognize my microphone. odd. since pavucontrol running fixes it, I figure there must be some way to automate this? without keeping the pavucontrol gui app running visibly on my desktop. what does it do? starts some service in the background perhaps?
Apr 23 10:58:25 <stemid>	or releases some lock, I can only speculate
Apr 23 11:00:24 <stemid>	pstree on its PID shows no tree.
Apr 23 11:07:36 <stemid>	I did this so far. added pavucontrol to autostarting programs. installed auto move window gnome extension and placed pavucontrol on workspace 2. that'll do I guess.

Apr 23 11:59:58 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: rpm -ql / rpmls
Apr 23 12:00:17 <FranciscoD>	for installed rpms, or dnf repopquery -l for packages in the repositories
Apr 23 12:00:32 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: ah, thanks
Apr 23 12:00:54 <FranciscoD>	rpm -q --provides will tell you the capabilities an installed rpm provides also
Apr 23 12:01:16 <FranciscoD>	and similarly dnf repoquery --provides applies to packages in the repos,
Apr 23 12:03:58 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: i want to search for a certain contained filename by pattern - dnf repoquery -l doesn't do that
Apr 23 12:09:51 <FranciscoD>	sudo dnf whatprovides '*/<filename>'?
Apr 23 12:10:00 <FranciscoD>	(sudo is optional, I always use the root cache)
Apr 23 12:10:33 <FranciscoD>	rpm -ql etc, give you the file list if you know the package name
Apr 23 12:10:48 <FranciscoD>	whatprovides tells you packages that contain/provide the capability

Apr 23 15:38:25 <CrazySam>	Fedora 31 comes with VBox GA preinstalled?
Apr 23 15:39:08 <CrazySam>	The VBox GA installer tells me that the system appears to have a version of it already installed.

Apr 23 17:42:43 <Khaytsus>	autopsy_: 1/3.
Apr 23 18:16:26 <ziff>	kk4ewt: not sure why, but after a full shutdown + power cycle (removed laptop battery and psu) my mobile broadband connection is working now. I did numerous reboots during troubleshooting, but that didn't help. Lets see if it keeps working.
Apr 23 18:16:44 <ziff>	kk4ewt: thanks again for your help
Apr 23 18:18:49 <ziff>	I had inserted the sim card while the laptop was running, maybe that was part of the problem
Apr 23 18:26:57 <kk4ewt>	Fedora 32 Final is GO
Apr 23 18:28:48 <ledeni>	kk4ewt, nice
Apr 23 18:35:44 <M_aD>	So the release is next week the 28th then
Apr 23 18:37:41 <kk4ewt>	@f32release
Apr 23 18:37:41 <fedbot>	Fedora 32 is planned for release on 2020-04-28, which is 4 days, 20 hours, 21 minutes, and 55 seconds from now
Apr 23 18:41:39 <Khaytsus>	Cool, missed the meeting today, was going to watch for it
Apr 23 18:44:42 <ledeni>	 kk4ewt, rc-1.6 will be final iso ?
Apr 23 18:45:57 <Khaytsus>	Yes
Apr 23 18:50:29 <ziff>	nice
Apr 23 19:00:53 <PPP999>	Hi
Apr 23 19:01:08 <PPP999>	I'm having an issue with grub2
Apr 23 19:01:22 <PPP999>	I have 3 entries for Fedora and I want to get rid of them
Apr 23 19:01:52 <PPP999>	Whenever I try "sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg" it doesn't list any of them
Apr 23 19:04:18 <prussian>	PPP999: I'd just use grubby
Apr 23 19:04:47 <prussian>	grubby --info=ALL; grubby --remove-kernel=...blah
Apr 23 19:04:50 <prussian>	etc
Apr 23 19:05:09 <prussian>	dealing with grub2 config is suffering in my opinion. one of the reasons I use systemd-boot
Apr 23 19:05:41 <PPP999>	Thanks I'll try it out
Apr 23 19:06:33 <cyberpear>	how do I launch a .sh file in Gnome?
Apr 23 19:07:10 <cyberpear>	(other than "open in terminal", then `./program.sh`?
Apr 23 19:07:33 <rindolf>	cyberpear: write a .desktop file?
Apr 23 19:08:01 <cyberpear>	then "open in terminal" then `./program.sh` is much faster...
Apr 23 19:08:17 <cyberpear>	I though once upon a time, I could just double-click the .sh file
Apr 23 19:08:32 <janos_>	is it executable?
Apr 23 19:08:35 <cyberpear>	yes
Apr 23 19:08:35 <rindolf>	cyberpear: right, if it's a one time thing
Apr 23 19:09:19 <rindolf>	cyberpear: behaviour like that made mswindows susceptible to worms
Apr 23 19:09:52 <cyberpear>	even a righ-click->execute would be helpful...
Apr 23 19:10:02 <ledeni>	cyberpear, check --> https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en
Apr 23 19:10:36 <cyberpear>	unfortunately, it'd have to be "convince third party to include .desktop file"
Apr 23 19:11:05 <rindolf>	cyberpear: why?
Apr 23 19:11:39 <kk4ewt>	cyberpear; or build one of your own which is not hard
Apr 23 19:11:42 <cyberpear>	because I regularly wipe the system and have to start from scratch
Apr 23 19:11:56 <cyberpear>	or I'm writing instructions for someone else
Apr 23 19:12:09 <rindolf>	cyberpear: then create an installer / setup script
Apr 23 19:13:53 <kk4ewt>	https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en
Apr 23 19:14:21 <tnelis>	Not sure I understand. When I double-click a shell script in Nautilus I am given the options to: "Run in Terminal", "Display", "Cancel" or "Run". Isn't that what you want?
Apr 23 19:14:44 <tnelis>	(You'll want to make sure that the program has a shebang and is marked executable.)
Apr 23 19:15:48 <janos_>	sounds like a missing shebang then - nautilus doesn't know what to launch with
Apr 23 19:15:59 <tnelis>	janos_
Apr 23 19:16:05 <tnelis>	janos_: My thinking as well.
Apr 23 19:28:09 <hiredman>	I've got a thunderbolt dock thing, which sometimes shows as charging my laptop when booted to fedora, but more often not, when in the bios it always shows as charging
Apr 23 19:28:27 <hiredman>	anyone have any idea what the deal with that could be?
Apr 23 19:32:46 <Khaytsus>	hiredman: is it charging?
Apr 23 19:36:06 <cyberpear>	tnelis: is there an extension to enable that? -- it just opens in gedit for me... it has a sheband line, and is marked +x
Apr 23 19:36:27 <hiredman>	Khaytsus: not according to anyway I can tell (upower and whatever polybar's battery module uses)
Apr 23 19:37:22 <hiredman>	powertop also shows as running on battery
Apr 23 19:43:37 <janos_>	cyberpear:in nautilus preference - behavior tab. Executable Text Files - has option "Run them". default set to "Display them"
Apr 23 19:44:18 <janos_>	there's also "Ask what to do"
Apr 23 19:44:25 <cyberpear>	janos++
Apr 23 19:45:10 <cyberpear>	janos_: exactly what I was looking for. thanks!
Apr 23 19:45:12 <PPP999>	I think I see the problem but I don't know how to fix it
Apr 23 19:45:22 <PPP999>	Every other OS says where it is on the disk
Apr 23 19:45:24 <janos_>	cyberpear: cool
Apr 23 19:45:28 <PPP999>	e.g /dev/sda
Apr 23 19:45:37 <PPP999>	the 3 entries for Fedora do not
Apr 23 19:45:48 <PPP999>	So that tells me they're found by os-prober
Apr 23 19:45:57 <PPP999>	Anyone know how to solve this?
Apr 23 19:48:54 <PPP999>	https://files.catbox.moe/u94d90.png
Apr 23 19:48:59 <PPP999>	Here's the partition scheme
Apr 23 19:52:03 <scr267>	Anyone know why starting a podman image would result in a "preparing rootfs caused \\\"permission denied\\\"\"": OCI runtime permission denied error" ?
Apr 23 19:52:31 <scr267>	I'm simply adding the "-v /home/<user>/somedir:/data/:Z" option
Apr 23 19:56:24 <Khaytsus>	scr267: try --systemd=false in your podman run
Apr 23 19:57:07 <Khaytsus>	scr267: Could also be cgroups v1 vs v2   and don't have any specific suggestions there
Apr 23 19:58:40 <scr267>	Khaytsus, I will try that
Apr 23 19:58:42 <scr267>	thanks
Apr 23 19:59:20 <Khaytsus>	Someone here a while back fiddled iwth cgroups to fix something along thoselines
Apr 23 19:59:37 <Khaytsus>	Now WHY?  No idea.  I've seen that too.  but I think in my case I fixed it with --systemd=false  I think.
Apr 23 20:01:01 <scr267>	Weird heh... well adding --systemd=false didn't work in my case it seems.  Thanks for the cgroups info though, I'll look for info about that.
Apr 23 20:02:00 <scr267>	oooooh geez, that sounds so familiar: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/fedora-31-control-group-v2
Apr 23 20:16:12 <prussian>	if you can, i'd recommend podman.
Apr 23 20:16:26 <prussian>	oh. didn't read enough
Apr 23 20:17:59 <yates_home>	where are the policy files that the "audit2allow -p" option requires on f31?
Apr 23 20:22:57 <yates_home>	if i just run audit2allow, i get this: https://paste.centos.org/view/9425d51e
Apr 23 20:24:05 <Khaytsus>	prussian: Podman is great, if you're on cgroups v1 I guess.  I have no idea what I'm on here.......  v2 I guess?  But podman works.  i dnno
Apr 23 20:29:57 <tnelis>	libpod/podman definitely support unified cgroups (cgroupv2). Moby/Docker was lagging a bit behind but I think it'll be supported in the next release or something (if not in the latest one already). There shouldn't be much reason to switch back to cgroupv1 in the near future.
Apr 23 21:14:37 <rindolf>	Hi all! Just letting you know that I've upgraded my f32 x64 sys to updates-testing, rebooted for the new kernel, and most everything seems to work smoothly - like before.
Apr 23 21:18:14 <rindolf>	Thanks all, and good night.
Apr 23 21:40:30 <Grinnz>	I'm not sure if it's how vmware has set it up, but Fedora seems to ignore Fedora live CDs when booting now and just boots to the installed OS. How do I get it to boot the CD?
Apr 23 21:41:52 <dowdle>	Grinnz: That would be your preferred boot device setting in your virt platform.
Apr 23 21:42:09 <Grinnz>	yeah nevermind, I just need to figure out what key to hit in the 0.5 seconds vmware allows me to. thanks
Apr 23 21:43:03 <Grinnz>	got it, esc
Apr 23 21:44:07 <Grinnz>	free version of vmware at least does not appear to have any setting for preferred boot device. oh well
Apr 23 21:52:37 <janos_>	impressive in the wrong way!
Apr 23 22:00:01 <Mordoc>	exit
Apr 23 22:02:45 <caterfxo>	ok. so, src.fedoraproject.org content is different from pagure.io content, right?

Apr 23 22:39:08 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, so I booted into windows
Apr 23 22:39:59 <mrvenkman>	And Windows crashed, with the new nbsod. (nice blue screen of death)
Apr 23 22:40:25 <mrvenkman>	Windows then offered to repair my Windows.
Apr 23 22:40:50 <mrvenkman>	And because I have a physical partition, I though yeh...
Apr 23 22:41:17 <mrvenkman>	So I think Windows has messed up my LVM

I keep getting the error Scanning not allowed while unavailable or activating.  iwlist does work.  I have tried to connect to a known ap, it says its unable to (via nmcli) and if i try to add one and connect it also does the same thing.
Apr 24 05:59:00 <phin>	Intel 8260 card.
Apr 24 05:59:43 <phin>	system worked with a previous 31 based silverblue and workstation setup.  Just attempting to do a minimal install as i do not want gnome on this.
Apr 24 06:02:10 <phin>	oh i was able to connect in the installer.  The install did create a nm profile.  this would not activate upon reboot
Apr 24 09:17:43 <StatelessCat>	Hi
Apr 24 10:10:42 <DTEIT>	phin: is the wifi enabled? what does nmcli radio wifi says?
Apr 24 13:55:08 <rindolf>	Hi all! I am also not fond of the default f32 updates-testing wallpaper. :(
Apr 24 13:57:00 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: Okay, I told them to cancel the release.
Apr 24 13:57:39 <Khaytsus>	Okay, it's done.  No 32.
Apr 24 13:57:39 <Khaytsus>	;)
Apr 24 13:58:04 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: heh
Apr 24 13:58:27 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: the one tha tlooks like it's..  grainy?
Apr 24 13:58:47 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: yes
Apr 24 13:59:12 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, it looks like it was rendered down to like..  16 colors ;)
Apr 24 13:59:28 <Khaytsus>	Maybe... 32 colors?
Apr 24 13:59:44 <Khaytsus>	;)
Apr 24 14:01:20 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: i think ubuntu should have made their bug no. 1 "release critical": https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Copying-Ubuntu-Bug-No-1/
Apr 24 14:02:47 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: 3 more years.  Windows will be a DE on Linux.
Apr 24 14:02:47 <Khaytsus>	And then we'll have to question is #1 fixed or not
Apr 24 14:05:38 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: BTW, any idea about https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/text/qt-and-firefox-update-graphics-artifacts-on-icewm-and-jwm-on-fedora32-x86_64.md ? should I report it on BZ?
Apr 24 14:05:39 <Khaytsus>	what in the world is this shlmifish thing?
Apr 24 14:07:51 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: shlomifish.org is my domain:
Apr 24 14:08:03 <Khaytsus>	oh
Apr 24 14:08:42 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: it is derived from my name: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml
Apr 24 14:10:28 <Khaytsus>	Anywho, yes, log a bug I guess.  You just ranodmly test all the desktops or switching around or ?
Apr 24 14:12:09 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: i normally use plasma5 but sometime i use xfce or jwm/icewm
Apr 24 14:12:45 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: and i tested the issue in gnome3 for completeness' sake
Apr 24 14:26:07 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: thanks, i filed a ticket here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827663
Apr 24 14:26:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	tWqaq, fix your connection please, one more bounce and i will remove you until you get it fixed
Apr 24 14:30:40 <jtagcat>	Docker repo is 404 on Fedora?
Apr 24 14:31:50 <rindolf>	jtagcat: hi
Apr 24 14:32:04 <rindolf>	jtagcat: what do you mean?
Apr 24 14:32:44 <jtagcat>	rindolf: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/ the repo mentioned there is 404
Apr 24 14:33:51 <billings>	or you could just use moby-engine
Apr 24 14:33:55 <jtagcat>	$ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Apr 24 14:33:58 <jtagcat>	Docker CE Stable - x86_64                       669  B/s | 577  B     00:00

Apr 24 14:33:58 *	fedbot sets quiet on *!jtagcat@193.40.103.87
Apr 24 14:34:39 *	fedbot removes quiet on *!jtagcat@193.40.103.87
Apr 24 14:34:44 <billings>	don't paste to the channel, use a pastebin like https://paste.centos.org
Apr 24 14:36:51 <rindolf>	jtagcat: you are on fedora 32 and that third party repo is only for f30 and f31
Apr 24 14:37:11 <rindolf>	jtagcat: you can try using podman instead
Apr 24 14:37:25 <billings>	BTW, moby-engine is just the open source version of Docker.  It still has the caveats of running Docker on modern fedora
Apr 24 14:38:39 <billings>	jtagcat: you've been unquieted, you don't need to PM me.
Apr 24 14:38:54 <jtagcat>	I facepalmed the moment I saw the paste come through..
Apr 24 14:42:24 <jtagcat>	What's the difference between podman and moby-engine? rindolf
Apr 24 14:43:07 <billings>	podman is a completely different container implementation
Apr 24 14:43:12 <billings>	moby-engine is docker's open source version
Apr 24 14:43:28 <billings>	(docker itself is not open source anymore.  jerks)
Apr 24 14:43:55 <billings>	(that was mostly tongue in cheek)
Apr 24 14:44:46 <Khaytsus>	jtagcat: Ask the Docker folks about their repo if you need to use it.  HOwever, you should see if podman suits your needs.
Apr 24 14:45:47 <jtagcat>	well I got my first mech kb from a friend I know and was told to use docker for flashing
Apr 24 14:45:54 <jtagcat>	https://pb.c7.ee/a205
Apr 24 14:46:32 <rindolf>	jtagcat: what does docker have to do with keyboards?
Apr 24 14:46:51 <Khaytsus>	nothing..  at all..
Apr 24 14:46:56 <rindolf>	jtagcat: do you mean a docking station?
Apr 24 14:46:56 <Khaytsus>	someone just put atmega in a docker file
Apr 24 14:47:19 <Khaytsus>	jtagcat: substitue docker for podman
Apr 24 14:47:19 <Khaytsus>	That simple.
Apr 24 14:47:25 <jtagcat>	I'm not very knowledgable on containers, as far as I know, he just throws everything in containers
Apr 24 14:48:19 <jtagcat>	What's the relation between docker and podman Khaytsus? iirc something about k8s?
Apr 24 14:48:51 <Khaytsus>	podman is an open source, root-less replacement for docker
Apr 24 14:48:51 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Southern_Gentlem
Apr 24 14:49:20 <jtagcat>	using search found me alias docker=podman
Apr 24 14:49:29 *	Southern_Gentlem sets ban on *!*@*240e:e0:bdba:d500:c51f:8dae:416e:4aba
Apr 24 14:49:29 *	fedbot has kicked tWqaq from #fedora (You are banned from this channel)
Apr 24 14:49:55 <Khaytsus>	Still unclear why you'd need a container at all for this qmk project
Apr 24 14:50:19 <jtagcat>	not sure as well
Apr 24 14:50:24 <jtagcat>	but I guess til more about containers
Apr 24 14:51:04 <jtagcat>	so moby is the open-source upstream for docker and podman is a drop-in replacement for docker (like sway is for i3) and better in some way?
Apr 24 14:51:43 <Khaytsus>	https://google.com/search?q=docker+vs+podman
Apr 24 14:51:45 <Khaytsus>	And seriously, you don't need a container here.
Apr 24 14:52:12 <Khaytsus>	https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started
Apr 24 14:52:36 <Khaytsus>	The only use a container really has here is not installing anything on the host os
Apr 24 14:53:32 <jtagcat>	well, thanks for your time
Apr 24 14:54:13 <Khaytsus>	100% sure that will just-work in podman
Apr 24 14:56:22 <Khaytsus>	Whole lot of weird obfuscation insttead of just following hte install docs
Apr 24 14:57:22 <Khaytsus>	 * The firmware size is fine - 24034/28672 (83%, 4638 bytes free)
Apr 24 14:57:37 <Khaytsus>	so yes, that worked just fine.. it's just put the compilation in docker files.

Oct 15 19:01:09 <The_Letter_M>	Any podman power users here?
Oct 15 19:04:57 <cmurf>	might try in #podman
Oct 15 19:16:13 <The_Letter_M>	Yeah. I asked my Q about using mariadb in a pod on Podman. They told me try asking in #maria and over there I got no response
Oct 15 19:17:26 <The_Letter_M>	The other response I got in #podman sounded like they don't know how to utilize pods
Oct 15 19:18:18 <Khaytsus>	Anything that works for docker should work in podman
Oct 15 19:18:43 <Khaytsus>	I wish there was a solid compose replacement, but just for runnong containers.. no biggie
Oct 15 19:26:07 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus Docker doesn't do pods
Oct 15 19:26:32 *	Khaytsus blinks
Oct 15 19:32:39 <The_Letter_M>	Ok. After looking it up, I am wrong; Docker does do pods.
Oct 15 19:32:43 <The_Letter_M>	Lol
Oct 15 19:33:03 <The_Letter_M>	I thought Pods were something that came from K8s
Oct 15 19:33:56 <Khaytsus>	I'm not quite sure what it has to do with what I said anyway
Oct 15 19:43:10 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus so I'm trying to deploy them inside a pod together. Being inside a pod they should beable to talk to each other using the pods internal network. I haven't seen any Docker compose files deploy a pod or container inside a pod.
Oct 15 19:44:42 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus: Ok so I should explain. I made a pod called "wordpress" and then I deployed a wordpress and mariadb container inside it. I used the options from the docker hub pages for both images, but the Wordpress site is saying it's having trouble connecting to the DB.

Oct 15 21:39:20 <hyperreal>	what are the recommended mount options for btrfs on fedora?
Oct 15 21:41:00 <cmurf>	hyperreal: defaults
Oct 15 21:41:39 <cmurf>	the rest are use case specific so you should be familiar with what they do
Oct 15 21:43:19 <memoryleak>	The_Letter_M: I understand your frustration, went through the same. What are the services running in your pod, only MariaDB?
Oct 15 21:43:51 <cmurf>	the one mount option that is recommended but not default due to detection limitations is: desktop usage on a hard drive (spinning) without significant database operations is to add 'autodefrag'
Oct 15 21:45:21 <cmurf>	unforunately detection of whether media is really rotating or not from sysfs is not reliable
Oct 15 21:45:31 <hyperreal>	cmurf: I see. I've heard people recommending 'ssd,noatime,space_cache,commit=120,compress=zstd'
Oct 15 21:45:43 <hyperreal>	I use an SSD
Oct 15 21:45:48 <hyperreal>	and nvme
Oct 15 21:45:56 <cmurf>	ssd mount option is autodetected reliably
Oct 15 21:47:26 <cmurf>	noatime is a tradeoff: less metadata writes due to atime updates once per day (for relatime, the default); but then things like cleaning up /var/tmp/ have to fallback to mtime (I think it's mtime)
Oct 15 21:47:47 <cmurf>	so some things get cleaned up more aggressively because mtime isn't updated on access
Oct 15 21:48:10 <cmurf>	so those files might be used, and atime updates would show that, but with noatime it looks like they aren't so they get thrown out
Oct 15 21:48:29 <cmurf>	space_cache is default already
Oct 15 21:48:37 <cmurf>	commit=30 is the default, not sure why you want 120
Oct 15 21:49:16 <cmurf>	compression is safe but you'll have to evaluate it for your use case; helps some and slows down others
Oct 15 21:49:38 <cmurf>	you can also lightening the level of compression so it takes less of a cpu hit with 'compress=zstd:1'
Oct 15 21:51:27 <cmurf>	s/lightening/lighten/
Oct 15 21:51:52 <hyperreal>	cmurf: okay, thank you

Oct 15 23:32:38 <VinAlencc404>	Hello, guys. How are you? I'd like to ask you something: on Debian, there's a repository called "backports" which brings recent updates to stable release. Is there something similar to it in Fedora? Would it be testing repositories?
Oct 15 23:34:45 <Sokel>	Testing is specifically for testing. when testing packages/updates pass and gets good karma, it gets pushed to the updates repo.
Oct 15 23:35:13 <Sokel>	I would not leave the "testing" repo enabled full time.
Oct 15 23:35:30 <VinAlencc404>	Sokel, got it. Thanks.
Oct 15 23:35:53 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404 just sudo dnf update will update you
Oct 15 23:36:44 <kk4ewt>	all updates for the stable release will be in the updates repo
Oct 15 23:36:49 <VinAlencc404>	kk4ewt, I know. But, do you know when there's a new version (like LibreOffice 7.0) and it's not into the official repo?
Oct 15 23:37:23 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404,  and when was that released
Oct 15 23:37:51 <VinAlencc404>	Let me check it
Oct 15 23:38:56 <kk4ewt>	i see packages for f33 of libreoffice 7
Oct 15 23:39:24 <kk4ewt>	you can always file a RFE Bugzilla  for f32
Oct 15 23:40:05 <kk4ewt>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=11024
Oct 15 23:41:09 <VinAlencc404>	LibreOffice 7.0 was released on August's first half
Oct 15 23:41:31 <VinAlencc404>	But, LibreOffice was just an example.
Oct 15 23:44:00 <Sokel>	not everything will get the latest in a fedora release. f33 may get libreoffice 7, but f32 may not. an rfe can be filed though to see if they will bring it to 32.
Oct 15 23:44:21 <VinAlencc404>	Got it.
Oct 15 23:48:34 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404,  koji is the fedora builder and bodhi is the test manager
Oct 15 23:51:01 <VinAlencc404>	kk4ewt, I'll check them. Thanks.

Oct 16 12:49:03 <lemonzest>	Yay, just a heads up, with todays gnome-flashback,panel,applets updates the gnome-flashback desktop is working again, until today colour calibration and bluetooth menus did not work, now do :) So I can use it as my main again :)
Oct 16 12:49:26 <fedora_sec>	Wait lemonzest what was the problem again?
Oct 16 12:50:40 <lemonzest>	the 33 beta version of the flashback desktop was a little buggy, in bluetooth menu it used to say not available (yet it was) and colour icc files did nothing, now both work for me on the 3.38 versions
Oct 16 12:51:03 <fedora_sec>	Ah that is annoying. What fedora system is that called? Just 33 beta?
Oct 16 12:51:29 <lemonzest>	oh sorry, Fedora 33 Workstation Beta
Oct 16 12:51:59 <lemonzest>	I just usually install the default gnome version, then install gnome-flashback and switch to that
Oct 16 12:52:35 <lemonzest>	in the gdm its called "GNOME Flashback (Metacity)"
Oct 16 12:52:41 <fedora_sec>	It's fine. I use Fedora Security Spin, partly because I like hacking distros but the other thing is that it is nice and fast even when connected to the 90V charger instead of the 135V charger on my Lenovo Thinkpad W510
Oct 16 12:54:56 <lemonzest>	I've been using Linux for close to 15 years, always liked gnome 2.0 style, used gnome-shell for a good 5 but always hated it, found out about gnome flashback an mate etc, switched to gnome flashback, nice and light :)

Oct 16 12:55:29 <fedora_sec>	Ah.
Oct 16 12:55:50 <fedora_sec>	That's nice to know. I just like any terminal as long as I'm using one that is fast and sleek
Oct 16 12:55:58 <lemonzest>	been using gnome classic shell for the past weeks and didn't like the feel
Oct 16 12:55:59 <akik>	wow so gnome-flashback is still available with metacity?
Oct 16 12:56:05 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:56:16 <akik>	+1 nice to know
Oct 16 12:56:19 <fedora_sec>	I especially like this one. In Fedora Security Spin
Oct 16 12:56:24 <fedora_sec>	+1 nice to know here too
Oct 16 12:56:33 <lemonzest>	for terms I use tilix :)
Oct 16 12:56:45 <fedora_sec>	Tilix? Is that installable?
Oct 16 12:56:49 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:57:24 <fedora_sec>	What's the package name?
Oct 16 12:57:50 <lemonzest>	tilix :P
Oct 16 12:58:09 <fedora_sec>	Ah thought so. Just checking to make sure what it was
Oct 16 12:58:36 <lemonzest>	its tabbed, like most, but can also split the windows/tabs
Oct 16 12:58:56 <fedora_sec>	That means I can have 2 terminals in one?
Oct 16 12:59:17 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:59:31 <fedora_sec>	Coolio. I like using screen
Oct 16 13:00:29 <lemonzest>	tmux is a good replacement for screen
Oct 16 13:00:32 <fedora_sec>	I just don't like it sadly
Oct 16 13:00:41 <FranciscoD>	lemonzest: make that tmux with byobu :)
Oct 16 13:00:44 <FranciscoD>	even better
Oct 16 13:00:52 *	FranciscoD was a long time screen user and then moved to byobu + tmux
Oct 16 13:00:56 <fedora_sec>	I tried it, didn't like it. Thanks for telling me about it. I'll put it in my memory bank
Oct 16 13:01:03 <akik>	was a long time screen user and still am
Oct 16 13:01:18 <fedora_sec>	I'm going to have it installed just in case
Oct 16 13:01:24 <FranciscoD>	akik: when I'd checked, there were certain advantages of tmux over screen, but I can't remember them now
Oct 16 13:01:50 <lemonzest>	was a long time irssi user, one day switched to Hexchat and never left
Oct 16 13:01:54 <fedora_sec>	maybe that it tells you what commands your running at the bottom
Oct 16 13:02:05 <fedora_sec>	I use pidgin now
Oct 16 13:02:28 <akik>	FranciscoD: i know i don't need to move to it as screen does everything i need
Oct 16 13:02:38 <lemonzest>	i used to use pidgin for icq/aim/msn/yahoo etc
Oct 16 13:02:51 <FranciscoD>	lemonzest: i was irssi till I moved to weechat, primarily because of the slack plugin
Oct 16 13:02:53 <fedora_sec>	akik: Same here, I even installed it on my Raspberry Pi 4 and I use it in SSH
Oct 16 13:06:27 <fedora_sec>	Hey lemonzest: How do I change the color on tilix?
Oct 16 13:07:42 <lemonzest>	go the menu settings, then default, and its in there
Oct 16 13:08:44 *	lemonzest has dracla theme for everything lol
Oct 16 13:09:56 <fedora_sec>	Thanks lemonzest. Lol

Oct 16 20:07:43 <cmurf>	dbristow: I don't know what the split is but even if only 5% of people need to shrink their fs in a 12 month period, it's 100% inconvenient to have to reformat and reinstall as a work around for not having it.

Oct 16 21:20:42 <Caterpillar>	anyone with dual intel + nvidia laptop experiencing system suspension (in RAM) black screen issues?
Oct 16 21:21:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	dell?
Oct 16 21:21:50 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, which fedora release ? wayland or Xorg ?
Oct 16 21:22:03 <Caterpillar>	Southern_Gentlem: Thinkpat T540P, Xorg, Plasma. I am remotely helping a friend
Oct 16 21:22:05 <kwizart>	which nivdia driver ?
Oct 16 21:22:15 <Caterpillar>	I am collecting all infos now
Oct 16 21:22:22 <kwizart>	same
Oct 16 21:22:46 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: are you affected too?
Oct 16 21:23:09 <kwizart>	no, but I have a weird report from user using nvidia prop driver
Oct 16 21:24:31 <quippy>	could someone help me troubleshoot why my HDMI device produces no sound all of a sudden?
Oct 16 21:24:57 <quippy>	done a few reboots, tried a different HDMI device on the receiving end, clicked all the buttons in GNOME and in pavucontrol
Oct 16 21:25:03 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, what about a gdm restart ?
Oct 16 21:25:08 <quippy>	not sure what my next steps would be
Oct 16 21:26:12 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: no, the system is so frozen that you cannot SSH in it, you cannot use magic sys req.       System details   Fedora 32, nvidia driver 455.28-1.fc32 from @rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver     kernel   5.8.15-201.fc32.x86_64
Oct 16 21:27:13 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, looks very weird, seems a candidate for a full report to devtalk.nvidia.com using nvidia-bug-report.sh
Oct 16 21:27:34 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: thank you for the hint, I did not think about nvidia-bug-report.sh
Oct 16 21:27:40 <kwizart>	(even if before the system is frozen)
Oct 16 21:28:24 <quippy>	this is a recurring problem for me on 32
Oct 16 21:28:40 <quippy>	but I don't remember how it was fixed last time
Oct 16 21:30:34 <Arc>	Is there an alternative RPM source I can use for packages fedora hasn't bothered to package yet?
Oct 16 21:30:44 <Arc>	I'm on Fedora 32 and I can't figure out how to find the package that includes the postgis_sfcgal postgresql extension
Oct 16 21:31:10 <Arc>	it appears the package doesn't exist and postgis was compiled without it. Ubuntu packages it separately.
Oct 16 21:33:04 <quippy>	never mind i'm an idiot I turned off my speakers and forgot
Oct 16 21:33:33 <kwizart>	please ask questions to ask.fedoraproject.org if no answer from this channel

Oct 16 21:55:52 <Khaytsus>	Arc: is it not just postgis?
Oct 16 21:57:17 <Khaytsus>	Al, okay.. looks like no SFCGAL for Fedora, so not built into that postgis
Oct 16 22:06:44 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: do you know how to start Xorg with -logverbose 6  ?
Oct 16 22:07:06 <Caterpillar>	it's suggested in https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/if-you-have-a-problem-please-read-this-first/27131
Oct 16 22:07:14 <Caterpillar>	the login manager is sddm
Oct 16 22:15:33 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, well, run "startx -- -logverbose 6"
Oct 16 22:15:54 <kwizart>	eventually before systemctl isolate multi-user
Oct 16 22:32:33 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: mmh ok

Oct 16 23:17:22 <x033gg>	i am using two browsers on fedora chrome and fedora but unable to watch the videos, it just shows 0 percent.
Oct 16 23:17:42 <x033gg>	what plugin would i be missing to be able to watch some video that was working on my work laptop :P
Oct 16 23:17:47 <x033gg>	I just do not use winblows @ home
Oct 16 23:19:20 <x033gg>	 Gatzzzbeee
Oct 16 23:19:34 <daniel-wtd>	x033gg: for fedora you will need the rpm-fusion repo and the package ffmpeg-libs
Oct 16 23:19:49 <x033gg>	thanks
Oct 16 23:19:51 <daniel-wtd>	afterwards restart firefox and it will play almost everything
Oct 16 23:19:58 <daniel-wtd>	even netflix
Oct 16 23:20:06 <x033gg>	wow you are the man of the night
Oct 16 23:20:45 <daniel-wtd>	sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
Oct 16 23:21:02 <daniel-wtd>	sudo dnf install ffmpeg-libs -y
Oct 16 23:21:08 <daniel-wtd>	should do the trick
Oct 16 23:23:48 <x033gg>	iget No match for argument: ffmpeg-libs
Oct 16 23:24:00 <x033gg>	oh wait i didnt see the whole thing
Oct 16 23:30:45 <x033gg>	if this works you are the man because at work they keep blocking me from education lmao :P
Oct 16 23:32:13 <x033gg>	yes!

Oct 17 00:06:45 <Arc>	Khaytsus: So back to the question, how do I get it on fedora?
Oct 17 00:07:03 <Arc>	if manual compilation is required the answer becomes "switch distros"
Oct 17 00:07:12 <Arc>	so I'm looking for an alternate RPM source
Oct 17 00:09:59 <Arc>	to repeat the question; I'm on Fedora 32 and I can't figure out how to find the package that includes the postgis_sfcgal postgresql extension. I'm looking for an alternate RPM source for gdal and sfcgal
Oct 17 00:12:06 <cmurf>	or build it in copr
Oct 17 00:12:26 <Arc>	if I'm manually building, I'm switching to gentoo.
Oct 17 00:12:39 <cmurf>	it's not manually building
Oct 17 00:12:46 <cmurf>	it's automatic, your own repo
Oct 17 00:13:53 <cmurf>	maybe someone's already done it, worth searching
Oct 17 00:14:00 <cmurf>	not sure how commont this extension is
Oct 17 00:15:21 <Arc>	within the GIS community its very common. But this is the problem using binary distros, someone else made a choice to limit what everyone else can do with it
Oct 17 00:16:58 <Arc>	everyone I'm working with is running arch, gentoo, or ubuntu. Within the GIS community Fedora is no bueno
Oct 17 00:22:37 <Dan39>	Arc: "GIS community"?
Oct 17 00:23:02 <Arc>	developers that work with GIS data
Oct 17 00:23:11 <Dan39>	lol
Oct 17 00:23:22 <Dan39>	nevemrind, bye
Oct 17 00:33:41 <Arc>	And that's why I keep switching to Gentoo. I don't know why I keep making the mistake of installing Fedora.

Oct 17 03:34:55 <grinchier>	hello all is there a usb wifi card I can buy that will work with secure boot?
Oct 17 03:36:15 <grinchier>	https://www.modio.se/installing-realtek-8821ce-driver-on-system-with-secureboot-enabled.html  trying to follow these instructions here but i must be doing something wrong
Oct 17 03:36:34 <grinchier>	I would just disable secure boot,  but on this hp laptop it magically re-enables itself after a week or two.
Oct 17 03:46:36 <terriblemistake>	guys, i need help. i added an nvme device to lvm. i created a lvm partition on it ("gpt"), created a pv, added it to the vm and extended the lv and the fs. everything worked until i rebooted.
Oct 17 03:47:24 <terriblemistake>	running lvm_scan in the recovery shell, i get "couldnt find device with uuid NNNN (last written to /dev/nvme0n1p1)
Oct 17 03:47:58 <der_Alte>	did you rerun dracut?đ
Oct 17 03:48:07 <terriblemistake>	i guess something went wrong with fedora reading the nvme device? someone could give me a light, please?
Oct 17 03:48:26 <terriblemistake>	no, i did not
Oct 17 03:49:29 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte, from here do you believe there's how to recover my OS?
Oct 17 03:50:34 <der_Alte>	well, yes, but you will need the recovery environment
Oct 17 03:50:58 <der_Alte>	adn make sure that nvme driver is loaded
Oct 17 03:51:04 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte oh sure, i am logged to the recovery shell atm
Oct 17 03:51:55 <der_Alte>	can you modprobe nvme ?
Oct 17 03:52:39 <terriblemistake>	this recovery shell doesn't have fdisk, lsblsk or cfdisk. i am checking dmesg now, looking for clues
Oct 17 03:52:45 <terriblemistake>	i will try
Oct 17 03:53:21 <der_Alte>	boot into recovery environment if you extended / FS
Oct 17 03:53:42 <der_Alte>	obviously that means eiher a DVD or USB key
Oct 17 03:54:05 <der_Alte>	or PXE if you have that on your local net
Oct 17 03:55:01 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte, i've just rebooted, and selected the rescue option, i see everything here
Oct 17 03:55:03 <terriblemistake>	my files, etc
Oct 17 03:55:45 <terriblemistake>	like, my root partition, everything is here. lvm is fine here
Oct 17 03:57:22 <der_Alte>	mount the root fs
Oct 17 03:58:08 <der_Alte>	and then rebuild initramfs with dracut for *the version of the kernel* that is in grub2 menu
Oct 17 03:59:14 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte root fs is mounted, everything seems fine in this rescue mode
Oct 17 03:59:29 <terriblemistake>	ok, will do. i am doing a last time backup first
Oct 17 03:59:59 <der_Alte>	check devices with lsblk
Oct 17 04:00:31 <terriblemistake>	all devices are here, everything is really fine here in this rescue mode
Oct 17 04:02:57 <tidux>	terriblemistake: sounds like you just forgot to add a driver to your initramfs with dracut
Oct 17 04:06:17 <terriblemistake>	right. so basically, i should run dracut --regenerate-all 5.8.15 ?
Oct 17 04:08:23 <terriblemistake>	tidux, i guess so. i didn't know i would need to deal with dracut
Oct 17 04:09:19 <terriblemistake>	it's weird though that the rescue mode found everything. after i typed in the root passwd, i got logged in with everything mounted and all
Oct 17 04:11:00 <terriblemistake>	actually, i think it's dracut --regenerate-all --kver 5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64
Oct 17 04:11:22 <der_Alte>	because it has the nvme driver in initramfs
Oct 17 04:11:49 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte sound good? just asking to ensure i won't make it worse
Oct 17 04:12:17 <der_Alte>	make sure that you include the nvme driver
Oct 17 04:13:06 <der_Alte>	man dracut
Oct 17 04:13:30 <terriblemistake>	k
Oct 17 04:17:49 <terriblemistake>	works, der_Alte, thanks a lot

Oct 17 18:37:42 <sdgathman>	rsyslogd[847]: imjournal from <elissa:psi-notify>: begin to drop messages due to rate-limiting
Oct 17 18:37:52 <sdgathman>	rsyslog is really bogging the system down
Oct 17 18:38:00 <sdgathman>	That is in the journalctl
Oct 17 18:38:39 <Khaytsus>	Seriously doubt rsyslog is bogging anything down
Oct 17 18:38:39 <sdgathman>	I turned off rsyslog service.  Hope it's not essential
Oct 17 18:38:58 <sdgathman>	It was absolutely rsyslogd
Oct 17 18:39:03 <Khaytsus>	..k
Oct 17 18:39:11 <Khaytsus>	Anyway, no, rsyslog has been optional for several releases
Oct 17 18:39:26 <sdgathman>	Now, it might be something trying to send it a %^&$ ton of messages ...
Oct 17 18:39:48 <sdgathman>	Anyway, back to normal after stopping it.
Oct 17 18:39:57 <sdgathman>	I might disable it if not really needed.
Oct 17 18:40:27 <sdgathman>	rsyslogd[847]: imjournal: ignoring invalid state file /var/lib/rsyslog/imjournal.state [v8.2008.0]
Oct 17 18:41:16 <sdgathman>	Another error it got that might be triggering the problem
Oct 17 18:44:21 <cornyst>	Khaytsus: Sorry! When you stated PA suspended, I probably incorrectly assuned you meant pulseaudio!
Oct 17 18:44:40 <cornyst>	Assumed
Oct 17 18:45:56 <Khaytsus>	cornyst: yep, that' what I meant, pulseaudio
Oct 17 18:47:49 <Khaytsus>	cornyst: I very rarely have any issues with PA, this one was an odd one.  Still confused what was going on, I'll have to reboot later to see if it recurrs but right now I need audio
Oct 17 18:48:21 <cmurf>	best guess is if rsyslog enabled, then you probably want journald conf storage set to volatile
Oct 17 18:49:42 <cmurf>	or you can set storage=none
Oct 17 18:50:08 <cmurf>	syslog socket still works when storage=none
Oct 17 18:51:52 <Khaytsus>	Yeah I think he's fixed a symptom not a problem, but anywho
Oct 17 19:02:07 <sdgathman>	I'm on a job, so I can't dig into the actual problem.  Stopping rsyslogd let's me continue working...
Oct 17 19:02:37 <sdgathman>	Upgrading a client from c5 (!) to c8 ...
Oct 17 19:03:09 <sdgathman>	Also dead disk on the raid array.
Oct 17 19:03:19 <cmurf>	eek
Oct 17 19:04:45 <sdgathman>	It's not that bad, fresh install of c8, copy stuff over from remaining good disk.
Oct 17 19:06:01 <cmurf>	i'm not super familiar with rsyslog so i'm not sure why it would become busy
Oct 17 19:06:28 <cmurf>	if anything it receives less information on the syslog socket and should have as much stuff to write out
Oct 17 19:09:37 <cmurf>	should ^not have
Oct 17 19:25:57 <Khaytsus>	Let me guess, you're doing some insane in-place upgrade using some method you came up with
Oct 17 19:29:34 <cmurf>	he said fresh install and copy over so i don't think it's in-place
Oct 17 19:30:14 <cmurf>	perf top -p PID might reveal some clue why
Oct 17 19:32:14 <cmurf>	bcc-tools has some neat tools for narrowing down various sources of latency

Oct 17 22:58:10 <cmurf>	akik: maybe more verbose output would help
Oct 17 22:58:27 <cmurf>	or possibly there's a malformed drop-in config in /etc ?
Oct 17 23:04:35 <akik>	cmurf: do you mean i should try to re-create the initramfs with dracut? i removed 5.18.15 packages for now
Oct 17 23:04:47 <cmurf>	it's a new error?
Oct 17 23:04:56 <cmurf>	just 5.18.15?
Oct 17 23:04:58 <akik>	the kernel updates so fast i don't mind skipping a version
Oct 17 23:05:03 <akik>	cmurf: yes new error
Oct 17 23:06:43 <cmurf>	hmm weird
Oct 17 23:07:09 <cmurf>	it's either a location configuration triggering it or it's a bug (or both)
Oct 17 23:07:29 <cmurf>	anything unique about the installation?
Oct 17 23:07:36 <akik>	cmurf: i can run that dracut-install command manually
Oct 17 23:07:58 <cmurf>	yeah but why '-m btrfs'
Oct 17 23:08:00 <akik>	i mean in a minute
Oct 17 23:08:41 <akik>	cmurf: this system has /boot on ext3 and / and /home on btrfs
Oct 17 23:09:05 <cmurf>	maybe dracut sees / on btrfs and adds -m btrfs
Oct 17 23:09:20 <cmurf>	but why would it fail
Oct 17 23:10:32 <cmurf>	can you post the entire journal somewhere?
Oct 17 23:10:57 <akik>	cmurf: yes just a minute, it's installing now
Oct 17 23:10:59 <cmurf>	journalctl -b --no-hostname -o short-monotonic
Oct 17 23:12:40 <cmurf>	i don't see anything btrfs related in the 5.8.15 kernel commits for fc31
Oct 17 23:12:42 <cmurf>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/kernel/c/67f15457dbf3534ecfebd1216752dc88e172642b?branch=f31
Oct 17 23:13:26 <cmurf>	dracut on fc31 was last update in May so that's probably not the cause
Oct 17 23:15:57 <akik>	the journalctl -b 0 outputs 30k lines
Oct 17 23:16:05 <akik>	are you sure you need that?
Oct 17 23:23:55 <akik>	cmurf: ok i get the same error with: dracut -f /boot/initramfs-5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64.img 5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64
Oct 17 23:24:55 <cmurf>	hmmmm
Oct 17 23:25:48 <cmurf>	can you add --debug
Oct 17 23:25:55 <cmurf>	and then post the output somewhere
Oct 17 23:26:30 <akik>	cmurf: the error comes after this line: Oct 18 01:23:36 ac dracut[200478]: *** Including modules done ***
Oct 17 23:26:38 <akik>	sure
Oct 17 23:30:58 <akik>	cmurf: here's the logfile for dracut --debug: https://transfer.sh/aBDp3/dracut.log
Oct 17 23:35:05 <cmurf>	what's the most recent successful kernel you've tried?

Oct 17 23:35:50 <akik>	cmurf: i'm on 5.18.13 now
Oct 17 23:36:27 <akik>	cmurf: i can try re-installing 5.18.13 to see if i missed that error
Oct 17 23:36:51 <cmurf>	any difference in the /boot/config file for 5.18.13 and 5.18.15? i.e. grep BTRFS /config/config...
Oct 17 23:37:01 <cmurf>	good idea
Oct 17 23:37:39 <akik>	cmurf: no, just two lines with the kernel versions
Oct 17 23:37:44 <akik>	differences that is
Oct 17 23:38:38 <cmurf>	do the configs show btrfs is a module or built-in
Oct 17 23:40:29 <akik>	CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=y
Oct 17 23:40:47 <cmurf>	hmm
Oct 17 23:40:48 <cmurf>	for both?
Oct 17 23:40:55 <cmurf>	13 and 15
Oct 17 23:41:10 <cmurf>	but yeah good idea to see if the error happens with dracut -f for .13
Oct 17 23:41:14 <cmurf>	no debug needed
Oct 17 23:44:17 <akik>	cmurf: yes =y for both
Oct 17 23:44:28 <cmurf>	interesting
Oct 17 23:47:06 <cmurf>	so i think you're going to see the same error for 5.8.13
Oct 17 23:47:09 <cmurf>	but it's non-fatal
Oct 17 23:47:16 <cmurf>	there is not btrfs modue
Oct 17 23:47:26 <cmurf>	i think that version of dracut isn't expecting btrfs to be built-in
Oct 17 23:48:18 <cmurf>	5.8 series was the first to have it set to built-in instead of as a module
Oct 17 23:48:53 <akik>	cmurf: ok i'm getting the same error on 5.8.13 too
Oct 17 23:49:14 <cmurf>	yeah i think it's not fatal based on your debug log
Oct 17 23:49:49 <akik>	ok thanks
Oct 17 23:49:51 <cmurf>	it is technically a bug i think
Oct 17 23:50:06 <cmurf>	if you want to file a bug against dracut you can so others find it
Oct 17 23:52:16 <Time-Warp>	looking for matthew miller
Oct 17 23:58:31 <cmurf>	but fc32 has the same version of dracut
Oct 17 23:58:37 <cmurf>	so why doesn't this problem  happen there?

Oct 18 00:36:06 <rakee>	Just installed fedora on my host and I am using it to stream video from nfs using vlc, but it seems to consume disc space for some reason (nothing else is running). /{home,opt,root,run,srv,sys,tmp,usr,var} are all constant according to du -sh ... any idea why this occurs? thanks!
Oct 18 00:42:16 <kk4ewt>	it has to download it into something to play it
Oct 18 00:42:32 <kk4ewt>	usually into var
Oct 18 00:42:37 <kk4ewt>	or tmp
Oct 18 00:42:55 <rakee>	kk4ewt, yes, so I thought, but both are constant in size
Oct 18 00:45:06 <kk4ewt>	ram or swap
Oct 18 00:47:28 <rakee>	kk4ewt, it makes df -h / output grow smaller, swap shouldn't do that now should it?
Oct 18 01:00:13 <kk4ewt>	what is growing smaller
Oct 18 01:00:37 <kk4ewt>	root yes becasue tmp comes out of /
Oct 18 01:00:37 <rakee>	kk4ewt, /
Oct 18 01:01:08 <rakee>	kk4ewt, isn't /tmp a tmpfs so it shouldn't show up, now should it
Oct 18 01:01:29 <kk4ewt>	it is still part of /
Oct 18 01:01:33 <rakee>	anyway on my system it's tmpfs and it's completely empty
Oct 18 01:01:54 <kk4ewt>	you are fine, your system is fine
Oct 18 01:02:05 <rakee>	so what? df -h shows filesystems not paths
Oct 18 01:02:22 <kk4ewt>	yes
Oct 18 01:03:36 <rakee>	kk4ewt, well why is / fs getting populated then? proportionally to video stream
Oct 18 01:04:12 <rakee>	du -sh  /{home,opt,root,run,srv,sys,tmp,usr,var} is constant on all accounts
Oct 18 01:04:45 <rakee>	and du -sh /mnt (where nfs is mounted) seems pointless
Oct 18 01:05:42 <kk4ewt>	df -h |fpaste
Oct 18 01:05:42 <kk4ewt>	mount |fpaste
Oct 18 01:13:12 <rakee>	kk4ewt, https://paste.centos.org/view/a2b8ed0d https://paste.centos.org/view/d44eb080
Oct 18 01:18:55 <rakee>	https://paste.centos.org/view/a2b8ed0d https://paste.centos.org/view/d44eb080
Oct 18 01:19:12 <rakee>	just in case you didn't get it
Oct 18 01:25:20 <cmurf>	rakee: the only think a bit out of the ordinary is /dev/shm seems high to me
Oct 18 01:25:24 <cmurf>	tmpfs           5.9G     0  5.9G   0% /dev/shm
Oct 18 01:25:26 <cmurf>	that's what i get
Oct 18 01:26:14 <rakee>	cmurf, shm started to be filled after root partition went to 0
Oct 18 01:27:11 <cmurf>	hmm
Oct 18 01:27:34 <cmurf>	oh yeah missed that :P
Oct 18 01:27:37 <cmurf>	/dev/mapper/fedora_localhost--live-root   40G   38G  916K 100% /
Oct 18 01:27:40 <cmurf>	that's odd
Oct 18 01:28:27 <cmurf>	what do you get for swapon
Oct 18 01:29:30 <cmurf>	tell you what though, you might do a kind of "emergency" delete of some things you can spare to avoid running out of space on /
Oct 18 01:29:36 <cmurf>	otherwise it'll get cranky
Oct 18 01:30:07 <rakee>	cmurf, don't have swap
Oct 18 01:30:10 <cmurf>	one of the things  you can do without in the short term is /var/cache/dnf/
Oct 18 01:30:37 <cmurf>	you can just rm -rf that, it'll free up maybe 30MB
Oct 18 01:30:53 <rakee>	already deleted some files a day or so ago, but that only postpones it
Oct 18 01:30:56 <cmurf>	another one is /var/cache/PackageKit/ - maybe 100MB or so
Oct 18 01:31:27 <cmurf>	yeah but 916K is basically zero, this is just to give you breathing room right now so you can find the real problem
Oct 18 01:31:49 <rakee>	moved close to 10G to the nfs, went down real fast after streaming from the nfs again
Oct 18 01:31:58 <rakee>	good call, yeah
Oct 18 01:32:10 <cmurf>	i don't know why streaming would affect space on /
Oct 18 01:32:42 <cmurf>	i don't see /home
Oct 18 01:32:45 <cmurf>	is it on / ?
Oct 18 01:32:52 <rakee>	yup
Oct 18 01:33:00 <rakee>	it's a single purpose machine really, just for streaming
Oct 18 01:33:04 <cmurf>	ok so maybe the real issue is going on in /home
Oct 18 01:33:07 <cmurf>	oh
Oct 18 01:33:08 <cmurf>	i see
Oct 18 01:33:28 <rakee>	according to du -sh, /home remained constant throughout all this
Oct 18 01:33:35 <cmurf>	ok
Oct 18 01:33:46 <cmurf>	du -sh /var
Oct 18 01:33:48 <cmurf>	what's that look like
Oct 18 01:34:08 <rakee>	1.8G
Oct 18 01:34:34 <cmurf>	yeah not bad, mines 23G
Oct 18 01:34:43 <cmurf>	haha wait why is it 23G?!
Oct 18 01:34:48 <cmurf>	oh VM's nevermind
Oct 18 01:34:51 <rakee>	 /var/cache is taking up close to 700, spool another 500
Oct 18 01:35:07 <cmurf>	spool contains an abrt dir, could be coredumps in there

Oct 18 01:35:55 <cmurf>	but also not sure where your free space normally is before the current situation
Oct 18 01:36:04 <cmurf>	anyway it's process of elimination to find out what's eating the space
Oct 18 01:36:21 <cmurf>	fatrace might be useful if you're looking for a heavy writer of something
Oct 18 01:38:41 <rakee>	don't know that one, but what would I trace? vlc? that'd have to be in /home ... not sure how to trace the nfs ecosystem
Oct 18 01:38:57 <rakee>	oh, it's systemwide
Oct 18 01:41:29 <cmurf>	you can trace whatever you want with -c
Oct 18 01:41:42 <rakee>	cmurf, brace yourself, it was a user zombie process (simplescreenrecorder) that apparently kept 29G somewhere on the drive
Oct 18 01:41:56 <cmurf>	just cd to the dir of the fs you want and then use -c and it'll only trace that fs
Oct 18 01:42:05 <cmurf>	but it shows everything happening on it
Oct 18 01:42:12 <cmurf>	haha!
Oct 18 01:42:22 <rakee>	thanks for your help though, I will look into fatrace ... looks interesting
Oct 18 01:43:53 <cmurf>	file access trace :)
Oct 18 01:55:40 <cmurf>	akik: well i'm stuck, no changes in dracut and yet this error doesn't happen on f33 where btrfs is also built-in

Oct 18 04:04:28 <Subsentient>	How's Fedora 33 coming along? Expected release date? Figure it's better to ask instead of trusting the wiki.
