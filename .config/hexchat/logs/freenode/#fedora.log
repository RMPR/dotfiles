Jul 11 10:14:05 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 12:59:14 <Legitkrillin>	hi all!
Jul 11 12:59:41 <Legitkrillin>	I am properly going to get abused but I need to ask something
Jul 11 13:00:34 <Legitkrillin>	I am a massive fan of Fedora and I have been using it for a very long time I simply love it, I have it on all my systems except one!
Jul 11 13:01:22 <dansimon>	Hi guys, I'm trying to customize my wm startup slightly (adding a xsetroot line), but which conf file should I use... not ~/.xinitrc since im running gdm, no luck hacking /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients... any ideas?
Jul 11 13:01:42 <Legitkrillin>	I was reading something that eventually fedora will be what Silverblue is today
Jul 11 13:01:46 <Legitkrillin>	is that true ?
Jul 11 13:02:11 <Legitkrillin>	is everything going to be containerized ?
Jul 11 13:14:46 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: it depends on how the project keeps proceeding.
Jul 11 13:15:10 <FranciscoD>	At the moment, I don't see the workstation product being replaced by silverblue anytime soon
Jul 11 13:15:29 <Legitkrillin>	but its going that way ?
Jul 11 13:15:44 <FranciscoD>	Lots of things don't need containers, so I expect rpms/dnf will remain
Jul 11 13:16:05 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: hard to say, no formal plans, but may happen in the future if the community decides its better tech etc.
Jul 11 13:16:41 <Legitkrillin>	fair enough
Jul 11 13:16:53 <Legitkrillin>	thank you for the info
Jul 11 13:17:16 <Legitkrillin>	for me f30is the best I have ever used
Jul 11 13:19:10 <Legitkrillin>	ok well thanks a million I hope you all have a good day! ^_^

Jul 11 14:20:11 <coz_>	good morning
Jul 11 14:20:34 <saml>	hi coz_ asl?
Jul 11 14:21:55 <mikeymop>	lol
Jul 11 14:23:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	saml, i am hoping that was a joke
Jul 11 14:23:44 *	mikeymop waits for him to has you the same question
Jul 11 14:24:38 <saml>	what do you use for multitrack audio recording?  recording more than stereo channels
Jul 11 14:26:11 <coz_>	saml,  have you tried ardour?
Jul 11 14:27:19 <coz_>	saml, not sure that's what you want, I hate to say this, but when I was composing, it was on **windows
Jul 11 14:27:23 *	coz_ ducks
Jul 11 14:34:16 <saml>	ardour is much bloated. looks like audacity can do as long as hardware supports
Jul 11 14:35:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	for some reason rosegarden pops into my head
Jul 11 14:36:05 <coz_>	I tried that once, I believe it is a notation app
Jul 11 14:36:16 <coz_>	not positive
Jul 11 14:37:41 <FranciscoD>	Not sure if this is up to date, but worth a check: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Jam_Audio_Spin
Jul 11 14:37:59 <coz_>	saml, you can also look here   https://www.slant.co/topics/6067/~daws-for-linux
Jul 11 14:41:11 <coz_>	saml,  out of curiosity, what type of things are you recording?
Jul 11 14:46:05 <saml>	coz_, i was wondering if I can record stereo keyboard along with vocal mic
Jul 11 14:46:18 <saml>	so, 3 channels
Jul 11 14:47:45 <coz_>	saml,  mm ok, I hate to say this, but on windows I used ntrack studio for such things, on linux, I found ardour to be a bit less user freindly, and I doubt ntrack will work in wine
Jul 11 14:49:06 <coz_>	saml, but i used a roland xv88 for all recordings
Jul 11 14:50:19 <coz_>	sam here are some very old pieces I did   https://soundcloud.com/cozziemoto
Jul 11 14:52:49 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 15:01:13 <rdieter>	ctOS: ~/.xsession-errors may have something
Jul 11 15:03:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: i've got that file but it's 0 bytes
Jul 11 15:04:12 <rdieter>	guessing you're not using sddm then
Jul 11 15:04:38 <ctOS>	rdieter: systemctl confirms that it's running
Jul 11 15:04:39 <rdieter>	gdm?  then ~/.local/share/ somewhere I think
Jul 11 15:05:02 <rdieter>	strange, I've never had an empty .xsession-errors with sddm.  <shrug>
Jul 11 15:05:21 <ctOS>	gdm is installed but not running. I originally had the issue with gdm, and switched to sddm to see if it would work. Same issue.
Jul 11 15:05:51 <ctOS>	rdieter: I deleted the file now and I'm restarting to see if it will be populated on reboot.
Jul 11 15:05:52 <rdieter>	ok, dm has nothing to do with it.
Jul 11 15:06:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I have the same issue in grub too. It's supposed to turn off the screen after 5 min. It turns off and then back on again. Tried using different cables but that didn't help.
Jul 11 15:07:01 <ctOS>	The monitor works as expected with other computers.
Jul 11 15:07:20 <ctOS>	Tried running the Ubuntu live CD but ran into the same issue.
Jul 11 15:07:22 <rdieter>	ctOS: does this work?  xset dpms force off
Jul 11 15:07:28 <rdieter>	that should turn the screen off
Jul 11 15:07:29 <ctOS>	Yes
Jul 11 15:07:42 <rdieter>	and it stays off as expected?
Jul 11 15:07:43 <ctOS>	It turns off for like a minute and then turns back on again.
Jul 11 15:08:10 <rdieter>	ah, then I suspect you may have an application that's waking things up, some active notification perhaps
Jul 11 15:08:14 <ctOS>	I've tried disabling screen locking. With screen locking enabled in KDE settings it doesn't ever power off.
Jul 11 15:08:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked the inactivity timer, and it keeps incrementing as expected. Not being reset when the screen turns back on.
Jul 11 15:09:09 <ctOS>	rdieter: issue also happens when I don't login and just wait on the login screen.
Jul 11 15:09:14 <rdieter>	in system settings, find the power/battery applet
Jul 11 15:09:28 <ctOS>	(I've spent a lot of fruitless time debugging this.) :P
Jul 11 15:09:29 <rdieter>	and click on it, it should show if there's any application supressing power management
Jul 11 15:10:05 <rdieter>	or if any app in panel is blinking
Jul 11 15:10:26 <rdieter>	that's 2 scenarios that could do what you describe
Jul 11 15:10:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked it. It has a check box for turning power savings on and off, and lists VLC when I use it. But I don't normally ruin that and it's not in the list unless when it's expected to be there.
Jul 11 15:10:50 <ctOS>	*normally run that
Jul 11 15:10:59 <rdieter>	vlc will supress power management when playing media, fyi
Jul 11 15:11:15 <rdieter>	(and sometimes even when not playing, quirky bug)
Jul 11 15:11:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: yeah, that's not the issue. I only mentioned it to demonstrate I've seen how the pallet is supposed to work.
Jul 11 15:11:34 <rdieter>	many media players support that these days
Jul 11 15:12:06 <rdieter>	ok, then I'm out of ideas.  that even with xset things don't stay off implies *something* is waking it up
Jul 11 15:12:14 <ctOS>	rdieter: thanks for your many troubleshooting suggestions!
Jul 11 15:12:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I know the screen locking thing wakes it up from observations.
Jul 11 15:13:01 <ctOS>	However, I've not found a log anywhere that says *what's* keep waking it. :-/
Jul 11 15:21:26 <sonik_>	trying another crack at getting my P52 to sleep when I close the lid.  I've looked at logind and confirmed that the lid close event is being generated
Jul 11 15:27:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	ctOS, is this a laptop or desktop
Jul 11 15:28:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, and powertop?
Jul 11 15:29:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, most of the time the issue in not going to sleep but waking up afterwards
Jul 11 15:30:23 <sonik_>	lenovo P52
Jul 11 15:31:45 <sonik_>	if i run `systemctl suspend` works...
Jul 11 15:32:07 <sonik_>	hardware key FN+sleep it works
Jul 11 15:36:55 <sonik_>	Southern_Gentlem, what am I looking for with powertop?  the lid event?
Jul 11 15:42:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, to see it sees anything that is preventing the sleep

Jul 11 19:35:23 <dvheumen>	hi, I am wondering if there is a way to verify installed package for corruptions. I am aware of 'rpm -Va' but it gives results that are hard to interpret. Any other options?
Jul 11 19:37:34 <webdragon>	package nemo-font-manager-0.7.2-4.fc24.noarch requires nemo-python, but none of the providers can be installed  https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/ddU1vwJRcclu-zoItICUdg  Known issue?
Jul 11 19:48:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, f24?
Jul 11 19:49:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon,  file a bugzilla (yes it is in the f30 repos)
Jul 11 19:49:58 <chrisawi>	the src package is font-manager, it looks like has been failing to build since then
Jul 11 19:50:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suspect it will be going away if someone doesnt port it to py3
Jul 11 19:55:32 <webdragon>	Fedora 29, Southern_Gentlem
Jul 11 20:16:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, but that package is f24
Jul 11 20:22:12 <dvheumen>	anyone knows a better way than 'rpm -Va' to verify packages for consistency, corruption, etc.?
Jul 11 20:27:23 <tmz>	dvheumen: That depends on what you don't like about rpm -Va and/or what you're trying to do.
Jul 11 20:28:14 <tmz>	You could use the python rpm bindings if you wanted to adjust the output, as one example.
Jul 11 20:29:49 <dvheumen>	tmz: my issue is specifically with the type of output. It lists the facts of what is changed, timestamps, checksums etc. But from the information I cannot determine whether this is good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:02 <dvheumen>	like, config files may change without it being an issue
Jul 11 20:30:15 <Khaytsus>	Changed is changed.  It's up to you to determine good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:16 <dvheumen>	but binary files you'd expect to be 100% original
Jul 11 20:30:18 <Khaytsus>	It's not an IDS.
Jul 11 20:30:47 <dvheumen>	okay, so there is no tool that takes a bit more of an informed approach to determine if changes are good or bad?
Jul 11 20:31:20 <dvheumen>	I was hoping for something that would indicate: hmm... these files are corrupted, consider reinstalling this package to ensure correct operation. (For example)
Jul 11 20:31:32 <Khaytsus>	No, how would it know if it's "corrupted"
Jul 11 20:31:53 <dvheumen>	checksum mismatch for binary files?
Jul 11 20:32:00 <dvheumen>	or file missing
Jul 11 20:32:54 <dvheumen>	(it may not cover 100% of package)
Jul 11 20:32:59 <Khaytsus>	It tells you if it's a config, etc....
Jul 11 20:33:14 <dvheumen>	hmmm ...
Jul 11 20:33:35 <dvheumen>	maybe there are some reasonable automated conclusions when parsing the 'rpm -Va' result
Jul 11 20:33:55 <Khaytsus>	You should not have a million rusults in rpm -Va
Jul 11 20:34:15 <Khaytsus>	It's not hard.  What are you actually trying to do, do intruction detection?  If so, rpm -Va is not what you want.
Jul 11 20:35:35 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: intrusion detection would be nice, but very difficult to do on the pc itself. (you'd need an independent, reliable source)
Jul 11 20:36:05 <Khaytsus>	An IDS will track all files, not just files managed by an RPM.  And if the file changes, it can warn.
Jul 11 20:36:09 <dvheumen>	but in case of corrupted files, i.e. disk failing, bad power cut-offs, etc
Jul 11 20:36:24 <Khaytsus>	rpm -Va is not appropriate for any of that.
Jul 11 20:36:41 <dvheumen>	okay, what would you suggest to discover corruption due to issues in hardware/software?
Jul 11 20:36:48 <dvheumen>	... hardware/power/etc.
Jul 11 20:36:48 <Khaytsus>	Is that a real problem??
Jul 11 20:37:27 <dvheumen>	I have had my doubts due to vague kernel messages that aren't conclusively saying "this shit is bad", but it does list a "Corrupted" error that is "recovered"
Jul 11 20:37:40 <Khaytsus>	So you have broken hardware
Jul 11 20:37:50 <Khaytsus>	Could you please just start with the problem, not XY
Jul 11 20:37:51 *	Khaytsus points to http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341 and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
Jul 11 20:38:20 <Khaytsus>	If you ahve broken hardware, fix it.  Run filesystem checks.  then rpm -Va is useful.
Jul 11 20:38:40 <Khaytsus>	But only for RPM-managed files.  And how do you know if a config file is modified, or corrupt.  You don't.  There's no way to tell
Jul 11 20:39:30 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: I asked about 'rpm -Va' to explore my options. For my specific problem: "pcieport ....: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, ..."
Jul 11 20:39:54 <dvheumen>	but then there are a lot of those, and it is hard to check if there are consequences to this
Jul 11 20:40:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, sounds like you need to test the memory and the har drive
Jul 11 20:40:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	hard
Jul 11 20:40:44 <dvheumen>	true, but I haven't found any conclusive evidence that something is wrong
Jul 11 20:41:00 <dvheumen>	I am worried a bit about silent corruptions
Jul 11 20:41:11 <dvheumen>	that's where I figured the checksums of rpm packages may come in handy
Jul 11 20:41:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	if the hardware is faulty how can you trust the software reports from it
Jul 11 20:43:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	the software is telling you something is wrong with the hardware
Jul 11 20:45:04 <dvheumen>	well, the thing is, those messages are more common than you'd think. Apparently it is not necessarily bad. And if this is true, you can at least detect if data is written incorrectly to a persistent store after reading it back
Jul 11 20:47:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, we are not here to argue with you, test your hardware and come back then we can go from there, (have results that we can look at )

Jul 11 21:19:00 <dvheumen>	Southern_Gentlem: anywhere I can find info on what has changed in the respins? I see the kernel only mentioned in the README, but I suspect there've been more changes
Jul 11 21:24:57 <Khaytsus>	dvheumen: any package updates since gold was made..
Jul 11 21:27:57 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: ow wow, so you follow all the updates. Thanks. I did not expect that much change :-P
Jul 11 21:40:58 <ePirat>	Hi
Jul 11 21:41:02 <ePirat>	Are there some packaging guidelines for stuff that uses GNUStep?
Jul 11 21:41:18 <ePirat>	I could only find https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/GNUstep which has no definitive info whatsoever
Jul 11 21:43:51 <sdgathman>	Is there a way to update Fedora with no IP4 connectivity?
Jul 11 21:44:42 <sdgathman>	Eh, some of the mirrors do have IPv6 - I don't know why it can't look them up...
Jul 11 21:52:39 <sdgathman>	ISP nameservers won't return IPv6 results...
Jul 11 21:52:59 <sdgathman>	Had to use my own recursive resolver over darknet
Jul 11 21:53:37 <sdgathman>	You may ask, "Huh?  IPv6 only?  Nameserver won't do IPv6?"
Jul 11 21:54:13 <sdgathman>	They charge a euro/month for each IP4, IP6 is free.  Simple profit motive.
Jul 11 21:57:06 <jidar>	what's wild to me is they don't have a IPv4 to IPv6 tunnel/proxy/whatever its called
Jul 11 21:57:31 <jidar>	my isp gives me a IPv6 but I can hit IPv4 sites all day
Jul 11 22:12:38 <Khaytsus>	Because $sdgathman
Jul 11 23:30:14 <mozzarella>	anyone familiar with libreoffice writer?
Jul 11 23:31:42 <coz_>	mozzarella,  I rarely use it and sometimes actually uninstall it, but is there an issue?

Jul 11 23:37:00 <chrisawi>	but a word processor doesn't really have discrete pages

Jul 12 08:07:22 <latenite>	Hi folks, I have installed a minimal fedora server and now I want it to have X. So I installed i3 (a tiling WM). After running 'startx' I get: "xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1193 does not exist"
Jul 12 08:08:17 <latenite>	after that and 4 longer waiting periods with: "xauth: timeout in locking file /Xauthority"
Jul 12 08:08:30 <latenite>	I get a blac screen...no Desktop no mouse no TTY
Jul 12 08:08:37 <latenite>	What am I missing here?
Jul 12 08:23:27 <grift>	probably xauth latenite
Jul 12 08:23:50 <grift>	xorh-x11-xauth
Jul 12 08:24:31 <grift>	actually i suppose yuo do have it
Jul 12 08:25:48 <grift>	you probably should start it like: startx /usr/bin/i3 (unlesss you have a .xinitrc file)
Jul 12 08:29:26 <latenite>	grift, I have xauth installed
Jul 12 08:29:52 <grift>	did you try `startx /usr/bin/i3`?
Jul 12 08:30:17 <latenite>	and I have .xinitrc with 'exec i3 -c /home/jd/.i3/config'
Jul 12 08:30:34 <latenite>	grift, no let me try that...
Jul 12 08:31:01 <grift>	well if you have an .xinitrc then it shoul work without /usr/bin/i3 , but try it anyway
Jul 12 08:31:28 <latenite>	it sais: xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1518 does not exist
Jul 12 08:31:54 <latenite>	and then timesout with : xauth timeout in locking authority file ?Xauthority
Jul 12 08:32:15 <latenite>	4 long times (*like 10 sec)
Jul 12 08:32:33 <latenite>	then I see a few X messages and get a totally black screen
Jul 12 08:32:40 <latenite>	no mouse no login nothing
Jul 12 08:33:07 <grift>	strange ... i use startx all the time with awesomewm and it works fine here so its not broken
Jul 12 08:33:22 <latenite>	I can do 'killall Xorg" from another tty and see that X terminated
Jul 12 08:33:40 <grift>	it should create the .serverauth file
Jul 12 08:33:47 <grift>	xauth
Jul 12 08:35:34 <grift>	you have these installed?:
Jul 12 08:36:09 <grift>	-driver -xinit -xauth -server-Xorg
Jul 12 08:37:02 <grift>	-drivers*
Jul 12 08:37:54 <grift>	but seems to me that theres a problem with xauth other than that i am not sure
Jul 12 08:38:22 <latenite>	I checked and I was missing -drivers*
Jul 12 08:38:26 <latenite>	I have them now
Jul 12 08:38:53 <latenite>	the problem remains though
Jul 12 08:39:27 <grift>	are there any .serverauth files in /home/jd lingering?
Jul 12 08:40:39 <latenite>	no none
Jul 12 08:40:41 <grift>	i ran out of clues though, this should just work: `startx /usr/bin/i3`

Jul 12 11:55:03 <gidna>	now I get Error: Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'fedora'
Jul 12 12:00:45 <gidna>	this fedora 30 is buggy
Jul 12 12:02:41 <slidercrank>	gidna, try again. I get this error sometimes. But trying again fixes it
Jul 12 12:03:34 <gidna>	the other method is switch-off /on
Jul 12 12:04:22 <alexcleac>	gidna: are you sure you don't have connectivity issues if it still doesn't work after retry?
Jul 12 12:06:45 <_val_>	maybe dnf clean cache or all ?
Jul 12 12:07:10 <gidna>	I'll try later maybe there's some congestion
Jul 12 12:08:36 <FranciscoD>	that's shouldn't be an OS issue, probably a networking one
Jul 12 12:08:42 <FranciscoD>	either a bad mirror or just bad connectivity
Jul 12 12:08:57 <FranciscoD>	switching on and off should not really have an effect on that one either
Jul 12 12:09:52 <alexcleac>	It may help though. If the networking issue was caused by dns cache or whatever related to local level
Jul 12 12:10:26 <alexcleac>	But there are always ways to find out debug those issues without switching on and off :)
Jul 12 12:12:14 <hortiel>	I'd like to know about more such /sys/ or other files if any? how would I get a list of them?
Jul 12 12:12:27 <hortiel>	monitor changing and controlling hooks
Jul 12 12:13:13 <hortiel>	any people's who know how to change the pixels?
Jul 12 12:13:35 <hortiel>	for example I'd like to control the gpu to output certain pixels to monitors
Jul 12 12:16:50 <slidercrank>	hortiel, how do you want to achieve that?
Jul 12 12:18:45 <hortiel>	slidercrank: via some files
Jul 12 12:18:50 <janos_>	..
Jul 12 12:18:51 <hortiel>	what are my options
Jul 12 12:19:19 <hortiel>	for example if I don't know that a backlight file at  a location exist, how'd i know about those?
Jul 12 12:19:29 <slidercrank>	if you want to control certain pixels, you should do it in the kernel driver, I think. You cannot access pixels directly otherwise. Well, you could use SVGAlib to have a low-level access to the video memory. Or have a full control in MS-DOS
Jul 12 12:19:29 <hortiel>	i'd like to employ a similar search functionality
Jul 12 12:20:27 <hortiel>	how to do it in driver
Jul 12 12:20:48 <slidercrank>	write your own driver
Jul 12 12:21:17 <hortiel>	but I can easily access the bit in disk without writing a driver because it's already provided... I am sure others have already built the drivers
Jul 12 12:22:01 <hortiel>	you don't write your own driver, if I wrote the driver I provide it to the whole world, and linux already has development done on top of that... just need the hooks
Jul 12 12:23:14 <slidercrank>	I have doubt that is applicable to modern GPUs. That would be epicaly slow.
Jul 12 12:23:16 <hortiel>	/dev/sda already gives low level control..
Jul 12 12:23:29 <hortiel>	so I doubt it there are none in the kernel
Jul 12 12:24:04 <hortiel>	Is there a channel where I can meet kernel devs or linux kernel channel?
Jul 12 12:24:13 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:24:39 <slidercrank>	but where do you want to control individual pixels? Under X?
Jul 12 12:25:32 <hortiel>	so that I can get some low level control similar to device files!!
Jul 12 12:25:46 <slidercrank>	:)
Jul 12 12:25:49 <hortiel>	yes slidercrank
Jul 12 12:26:00 <slidercrank>	that is not going to happen
Jul 12 12:26:31 <hortiel>	:(
Jul 12 12:26:41 <slidercrank>	but the channel is #kernel
Jul 12 12:27:24 <hortiel>	can I mail linux devs?
Jul 12 12:27:41 <hortiel>	I'd like to ask if they've already known something similar.
Jul 12 12:27:44 <slidercrank>	yes, but I am afraid they will laugh at the request
Jul 12 12:27:48 <alexcleac>	I think there is a way to control every pixel on kernel level, otherwise, the X11, Mir and Wayland wouldn't be possible
Jul 12 12:27:59 <slidercrank>	And there are hundreds emails a day
Jul 12 12:28:29 <slidercrank>	hortiel, lkml
Jul 12 12:28:34 <slidercrank>	linux kernel maillist
Jul 12 12:29:31 <slidercrank>	it feels like you are doing something the wrong way
Jul 12 12:29:49 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I find nothing funny about it. I wish you could take me seriously. before writing my own kernel code- I'd first like to figure out it's components low -level ones, and use them first.
Jul 12 12:30:12 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I do manipulate individual bits, using /dev/sda ... what's wrong? are you kidding me?
Jul 12 12:30:22 <slidercrank>	maybe study the graphics stack first? Writing a driver isn't an easy thing
Jul 12 12:30:22 <hortiel>	I'd do low level access for education use.
Jul 12 12:30:45 <slidercrank>	hortiel, then MS-DOS would be the best choice! Full control of everything!
Jul 12 12:30:54 <hortiel>	slidercrank: wtf
Jul 12 12:31:16 <slidercrank>	nothing impedes your games with hardware.
Jul 12 12:31:31 <slidercrank>	direct access to every register.
Jul 12 12:31:44 <hortiel>	in ms-dos?
Jul 12 12:31:49 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:32:03 <alexcleac>	I think in FreeDOS you can have this too :)
Jul 12 12:32:03 <slidercrank>	or freedos (which is basically the same)
Jul 12 12:32:29 <hortiel>	hmm, interesting, which cmd ? do I have to run ms-dos on top of linux or baremetal?
Jul 12 12:32:54 <slidercrank>	no, not under any OS. Load it directly
Jul 12 12:33:16 <slidercrank>	or better use a Virtual Machine
Jul 12 12:33:35 <slidercrank>	hardware is well-emulated
Jul 12 12:34:14 <hortiel>	VM too is running "under" an OS.
Jul 12 12:34:28 <hortiel>	or better said on top of it
Jul 12 12:34:36 <slidercrank>	yes, but hardware is emulated well. That's enough for educational purposes
Jul 12 12:34:48 <hortiel>	ok. which cmd to do that
Jul 12 12:35:08 <slidercrank>	you can use VirtualBox or QEMU
Jul 12 12:35:35 <slidercrank>	knowing Assembly would be beneficial
Jul 12 12:37:01 <slidercrank>	hortiel, but what are you trying to achieve?
Jul 12 12:38:53 <slidercrank>	why can't you use SDL/OpenGL or any another graphics lib?
Jul 12 12:39:34 <hortiel>	slidercrank: sorry, I was just fascinated how I could change the bytes in /dev/sda and would like to "extend MY REACH" further down the rabbit hole.
Jul 12 12:40:15 <hortiel>	don't know C
Jul 12 12:40:20 <slidercrank>	not everything is a file in the Linux world (the concept everything is a file was extended in Plan9).
Jul 12 12:40:32 <slidercrank>	the network card is not a file, for example
Jul 12 12:40:52 <hortiel>	no in /dev I can *tons* of networking files...
Jul 12 12:41:01 <hortiel>	they are unbuffered though.
Jul 12 12:41:12 <slidercrank>	the same is the GPU. Something may be exposed with a file system. But not what you want
Jul 12 12:42:27 <slidercrank>	you cannot send a file over network by running # cat ~/cat_pix.gz > /dev/eth0
Jul 12 12:46:36 <hortiel>	are there any other tcp interfaces through which I can do that?
Jul 12 12:46:38 <hortiel>	surely there are
Jul 12 12:47:13 <slidercrank>	not via the file system
Jul 12 12:48:20 <slidercrank>	you have to communicate with the kernel. usually via a library.
Jul 12 12:49:44 <slidercrank>	that's the purpose or the division into the kernel space and userspace. Everything relating to hardware is done in the kernel space. You (from userspace) can only beg the kernel (via its driver) to do something for you. you cannot control hw registers directly
Jul 12 12:49:55 <slidercrank>	*purpose of
Jul 12 12:50:51 <slidercrank>	some interfaces are exposed via the file system. As in /dev/[hs]d[a-z][0-9].
Jul 12 13:13:37 <hortiel>	slidercrank: what If I use mknod to make some files, and then control it without using libs

Jul 12 13:18:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel, if you are wanting to recreate the wheel that is fine, not much we can do to help you in this channel
Jul 12 13:19:34 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: no I don't want to , just use existing tools, like mknode and simple commands without *code* hence no recreating.
Jul 12 13:19:51 <hortiel>	basically trivial ways to do stuff
Jul 12 13:20:08 <hortiel>	such as writing/reading files or some other simple cmd
Jul 12 13:20:13 <hortiel>	thast's it!!
Jul 12 13:20:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel,  so trival then why are you asking
Jul 12 13:20:44 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: ?? because it can be done trivially after discovering it, not before

Jul 12 13:45:54 <sdgathman>	hortiel: to send a file over tcp I use nc
Jul 12 13:46:12 <sdgathman>	From the nmap-ncat package
Jul 12 13:46:38 <sdgathman>	nc 1.2.3.4 1234 <file
Jul 12 13:46:57 <sdgathman>	and on the other end, nc -l
Jul 12 13:48:24 <sdgathman>	If both ends are using an end-to-end encrypted VPN, then the transfer is even secure.
Jul 12 13:48:55 <Khaytsus>	That's utterly insane.

Jul 12 14:39:19 <Khaytsus>	essich1: You're 100% nobody has done this?  Often people ask these questions and it already exists in COPR, etc.
Jul 12 14:50:20 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: This is quite complicated! To add the package, I need an account (okay), need to sign a CLA (why?) and this needs approval.
Jul 12 14:52:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	because other wise the wiki gets filled with spam/pornbots
Jul 12 14:53:48 <essich1>	Maybe. But for e.g. Guix one simply needs to send an email to the bug tracker - no hazzle at all.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: Thansk, but I'm giving up on this. Can't log-in. "your account must have at least one non cla* group to be able to login and edit" Whatever this means -  seams to be for experts only.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Is there another way to propose a package?

Jul 12 15:20:09 <Khaytsus>	Plus GDPR does not require you don't log it, as long as the logs are secure and not stored.
Jul 12 15:24:05 <essich1>	Khaytsus: I'm not going to discuss the GDPR, how to read it or how to configure apache - YMMV.
Jul 12 15:24:06 <essich1>	The link you posted removes the IP- address, while many admins want to keep an anonymizes one (e.g. for rough geo-location).

Jul 12 15:49:10 <prussian>	for such a small thing, you might be ebtter off standing up your own repo or just having customers use pip or some other packaging tool directly =/

Jul 15 20:28:30 <RagingBuffalo>	try again something else....
Jul 15 20:29:04 <RagingBuffalo>	I'm still on that "No input" with that T480s, fedora 30 and the official thunderbolt dockng station lenovo
Jul 15 20:29:14 <RagingBuffalo>	tried since 08h45 am
Jul 15 20:30:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	what were you doing using rufus
Jul 15 20:31:21 <RagingBuffalo>	I went trying to have a live bootable usb with windows, so I could flash the docking station firmware
Jul 15 20:34:07 <RagingBuffalo>	Wasted most of my time with that piece of junkware
Jul 15 20:34:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	will it work with the fwupdate in fedora
Jul 15 20:34:44 <RagingBuffalo>	They event give some sort of poor warning, you need to modify file stupi1dfyle.sys, with changing 1809 by 1803, otherwise you get bluescreen.
Jul 15 20:34:52 <RagingBuffalo>	There was no such 1809 in the file!!
Jul 15 20:35:11 <RagingBuffalo>	No idea, can we update the docking station with "FW update"?
Jul 15 20:35:45 <RagingBuffalo>	I tried numerous options, boltctl, display link drivers in dnf, etc...
Jul 15 20:35:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	you tell us
Jul 15 20:36:28 <RagingBuffalo>	Hm, I don't thnk it can do for the docking firmware.
Jul 15 20:36:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Jul 15 20:36:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	crap
Jul 15 20:36:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	fwupd.x86_64 : Firmware update daemon
Jul 15 20:37:26 <RagingBuffalo>	hm... can I upload a fw of a docking through vibox?
Jul 15 20:37:34 <RagingBuffalo>	from theVM? I doubt it
Jul 15 20:39:50 <RagingBuffalo>	According to this it's only laptops
Jul 15 20:39:51 <RagingBuffalo>	https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devicelist
Jul 15 20:39:56 <RagingBuffalo>	not docking station
Jul 15 20:40:00 <RagingBuffalo>	(from lenovo)
Jul 15 20:41:15 <RagingBuffalo>	Well thanks for the help Southern_Gentlem, I finished for today, I'm at it since 08h45am I will try again tomorrow
Jul 15 20:43:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	RagingBuffalo, is this a fresh install that has been updated ?
Jul 15 20:43:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	also was the docking station plugged in during the install
Jul 15 20:45:58 <Khaytsus>	fwupd is useless for everything I've ever tried
Jul 15 20:46:06 <Khaytsus>	It lists a bunch of stuff but can't update any of it

Jul 15 21:23:21 <MrMc>	I just have installed a library in /usr/local/lib64 did ldconfig but still get bladeRF-cli: error while loading shared libraries: libbladeRF.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Jul 15 21:28:05 <prussian>	MrMc: do you have libbladeRF.so.2 in any particular location along your ld.so.conf declared paths?
Jul 15 21:29:08 <prussian>	well, if you put it /usr/{local/}lib64 it should have worked
Jul 15 21:29:35 <prussian>	have you tried using LD_LIBRARY_PATH just for the sake of sanity?
Jul 15 21:33:50 <MrMc>	I put it in /usr/local/lib64 and it did not work
Jul 15 21:34:39 <MrMc>	I have just installed it in /usr/lib64 and it works
Jul 15 21:35:53 <prussian>	might want to add a ld.so.conf for that then
Jul 15 21:36:15 <mroche>	I don't believe /usr/local/* is on the LD_PATH by default. At least it isn't on RHEL 7
Jul 15 21:36:26 <mroche>	I could be wrong...
Jul 15 21:36:53 <prussian>	/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF with /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF and just drop libbladeRF.so into /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF
Jul 15 21:36:57 <prussian>	then ldconfig
Jul 15 21:37:07 <prussian>	well, /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF.conf
Jul 15 21:40:39 <MrMc>	@prussian Thank you. I think installing in /usr/lib64 is easier
Jul 15 21:49:07 <Khaytsus>	Or just run it like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path blackRF-cli
Jul 15 23:53:02 <RayTracer>	My upgrade from F29 to F30 didn't go so well. After ~1h I found `enforcing=0` and I could use the system again. Boot log contains lots of "avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 tcontext= tclass=dbus" messages. Is such an issue known?
Jul 15 23:55:53 <dowdle>	RayTracer: First time I've heard of it... but... you should be able to do a relabel and see if that helps.
Jul 15 23:57:04 <linuxmodder>	seems I got clobbered in that netsplit too :(
Jul 16 00:00:52 <RayTracer>	dowdle: I did `touch /.autorelabel` but I think I'll defer the reboot to the next kernel update
Jul 16 00:01:20 <dowdle>	RayTracer: Manually reboot.
Jul 16 00:03:37 <RayTracer>	ok, I'm curious.. brb hopefully
Jul 16 00:11:47 <RayTracer>	dowdle: the relabel unfortunately didn't fix it
Jul 16 00:16:58 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've had an issue with the live media of my personal remix of Workstation having an SELinux issue... but I don't think it is related to your issue.  What types of errors do you see when trying to boot with SELinux on?
Jul 16 00:18:34 <RayTracer>	the system seems to boot normally, but doesn't run graphical login (lightdm), and trying multi-user.target I get a login prompt that doesn't log me in
Jul 16 00:18:51 <RayTracer>	sshd accepts my connection but doesn't present a shell as well
Jul 16 00:21:56 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've done quite a few F2x -> F30 updates but not any recently.
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	according to the AVC messages something, or nothing, can talk to dbus?
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	"avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:xdm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext= tclass=dbus permissive=1 exe="/usr/bin/dbus-broker" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'"

Jul 16 00:38:43 <RayTracer>	as root, using sudo -i
Jul 16 00:39:22 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  confirm it ran please ls -A /root | grep -i '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:39:33 <linuxmodder>	as root or sudo -i of course
Jul 16 00:41:10 <linuxmodder>	my apoligizes sudo ls -lA / | grep '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:42:19 <RayTracer>	fwiw, this is the failed boot log https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/HoRrrmvTb4cdRB62vvNn6A
Jul 16 00:42:43 <RayTracer>	linuxmodder: that grep doesn't show anything
Jul 16 00:43:11 <RayTracer>	it did the relabel process, I watched it on the screen
Jul 16 00:43:55 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  what locked down craziness are you running on that box ? :P
Jul 16 00:44:56 <linuxmodder>	looks more like a mdadm selinux fail first
Jul 16 00:45:19 <RayTracer>	ah, I have /proc mounted with hidepid=2 as an additional oddity
Jul 16 00:46:06 <linuxmodder>	the neednet=  ....  was crazy in itself
Jul 16 00:46:55 <RayTracer>	I don't know why multipath is in play at all..
Jul 16 00:47:11 <linuxmodder>	it is tho which is odd
Jul 16 00:47:23 <linuxmodder>	and that seems to be piling up to the dbus X11 part
Jul 16 00:47:33 <linuxmodder>	not seeing any smoking guns tho as to why
Jul 16 00:47:39 <RayTracer>	that line is needed unfortunately, because the dracut scripts insists on persisting the cmdline config to disk
Jul 16 00:48:11 <linuxmodder>	which part?
Jul 16 00:48:18 <linuxmodder>	the neednet part?
Jul 16 00:48:21 <RayTracer>	so I need to specify full network there, and not just the part needed for being able to ssh
Jul 16 00:48:23 <RayTracer>	yes
Jul 16 00:48:35 <linuxmodder>	that is insanity

Oct 11 15:54:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, use fpaste
Oct 11 16:05:00 <RMPR>	Hello, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask but when I install hadoop suite with: dnf install "hadoop-*", I'm not able to use it with the default system jdk (8). I tried "import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;" and I get the error: "WordCount.java:4: error: package org.apache.hadoop.fs does not exist"
Oct 11 16:08:38 <RMPR>	I got this working with the manual install of hadoop (which is very painful) but then what is the purpose of having hadoop inside the main repository if it doesn't work ? 
Oct 11 16:09:05 <Lutinmalin>	here goes Southern_Gentlem https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/6YzDlNmg9GUC29g1M-evig
Oct 11 16:10:53 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Honestly, I'm not sure Fedora is the first place I'd go to for something like hadoop.  Unless you're setting up ephemeral VMs and tearing them down later.  Fedora has a fairly short life cycle, and hadoop is, to my general knowledge, pretty large data sets that likely live a long time.
Oct 11 16:11:55 <RMPR>	I thought about this channel because well, it's available on the main repos.
Oct 11 16:12:05 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: is there a readme in the hadoop package?
Oct 11 16:12:14 <FranciscoD>	Sometimes even after installation, some manual steps are required
Oct 11 16:12:38 <FranciscoD>	Generally maintainers put these steps in "README.Fedora" files in the packages
Oct 11 16:12:42 <RMPR>	I'm not sure how to verify this 
Oct 11 16:12:59 <FranciscoD>	rpm -qd <package> or look in /usr/share/doc/hadoop*
Oct 11 16:13:35 <FranciscoD>	Ah, also worth noting that hadoop is now orphaned: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/hadoop
Oct 11 16:13:51 <FranciscoD>	no builds for f31
Oct 11 16:14:50 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: what fedora releas are you on?
Oct 11 16:15:00 <RMPR>	fedora 30 workstation
Oct 11 16:15:37 <FranciscoD>	that's the last release with hadoop from the looks of it
Oct 11 16:16:44 <RMPR>	FranciscoD hadoop 2.7.6
Oct 11 16:16:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, thank you that way we dont get all the spam
Oct 11 16:16:54 <leden>	Lutinmalin: check 'tweaks' for 'suspend when laptop lid is closed' is on -- General
Oct 11 16:18:04 <RMPR>	FranciscoD even the NOTICE.TXT isn't that useful
Oct 11 16:18:24 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: yeh, it's unmaintained, so I don't expect it to be in good shape
Oct 11 16:20:01 <FranciscoD>	https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/hadoop/overview/
Oct 11 16:22:32 <Lutinmalin>	leden, not sure I understood you. I picked "suspend" in the power management settings. I also tried 'hibernate'
Oct 11 16:23:12 <Lutinmalin>	(I'm on LXQT)
Oct 11 16:24:19 <leden>	Lutinmalin: oh sorry i was think you running workstation
Oct 11 16:24:33 <Lutinmalin>	no worries
Oct 11 16:25:22 <Peetz0r>	hey! Is there a list of current fedora 31 release blocking bugs somewhere?
Oct 11 16:26:03 <FranciscoD>	Peetz0r: https://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs/
Oct 11 16:27:08 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Not saying it won't work or is a terrible idea.. just that Fedora has a fairly fast life cycle compared to RHEL or CentOS etc.

Oct 11 20:52:17 <josvuk>	plocki: should i deaktivate it?
Oct 11 20:55:59 <plocki>	josvuk: first check if you are running openssh-server
Oct 11 20:56:56 <josvuk>	plocki: how to check it?

Oct 11 21:01:22 <plocki>	josvuk: i just checked my f30 desktop machine: sshd is not running by default. so you need to make it start: systemctl enable sshd

Oct 11 21:08:05 <josvuk>	no, i am on guest fedora30 ...
Oct 11 21:11:55 <josvuk>	but tried it now from cygwin prompt and from win10 comand prompt both the result from ssh josef@localhost -p 2222 is connection refused.
Oct 11 21:12:36 <josvuk>	from the host where virtualbox is running ...
Oct 11 21:14:04 <plocki>	josvuk: hm. does it work from guest host itself? ssh localhost
Oct 11 21:19:52 <josvuk>	plocki: Yes, it works i get a ssh connection from the host operating system Win10home to guest fedora30
Oct 11 21:20:39 <plocki>	josvuk:OK! if you want to connect from another host (i missed that point) you need to change the virtual-box nat rule: change host IP 127.0.0.1 to according local IP of Vbox-Host.
Oct 11 21:21:28 <plocki>	josvuk: after that you should reach yout box by ssh user@ip.of.xbox.host -p 2222
Oct 11 21:23:15 <josvuk>	hm, o.k can i simply add a new portforwarding rule?
Oct 11 21:23:59 <plocki>	josvuk: yes. and you need an according firewall rule on the windows box

Oct 11 21:34:01 <dowdle>	Figured it out (how to get a Let's Encrypt SSL cert for an unreachable server).  As long as you can make a DNS TXT record for the unreachable host you can do it with the following form:
Oct 11 21:34:10 <dowdle>	certbot -d www.whatever.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
Oct 11 21:34:18 <dowdle>	Then it'll spit out what DNS TXT record it wants with value it gives.
Oct 11 21:44:50 <yasumi2136>	i installed vim and without create ~/.vimrc i find it is already well-configured to edit JavaScript file (with indent, color syntax and so on) but i just want to modify the tabstop/shiftwidth to set it to 4. To try out, i created a ~/.vimrc with theses options but all configuration is modified
Oct 11 21:44:58 <yasumi2136>	how to change the indent tab option by keeping this default configuration provided by Fedora
Oct 11 22:30:10 <sdk>	Does anyone know could cause `Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1`. It prevents me from opening an application and I need to reboot. I've searched on the internet but what I found is related to ssh X forwarding. However, I don't use it.
Oct 11 22:32:20 <bugs_>	i've seen that where the home directory is read only
Oct 11 22:32:54 <sdk>	Nope. I have write permission.
Oct 11 22:33:14 <bugs_>	try ssh -x
Oct 11 22:33:54 <sdk>	bugs_: I got the error without using ssh.
Oct 11 22:34:22 <bugs_>	look at the owner and permissions on ~/.Xauthority
Oct 11 22:35:22 <bugs_>	check your DISPLAY environment variable too
Oct 11 22:37:13 <sdk>	DISPLAY is good and .Xauthority has 600. Should the permission be different?
Oct 11 22:37:20 <bugs_>	nope
Oct 11 22:37:47 <bugs_>	do you have an XAUTHORITY environment variable?
Oct 11 22:38:25 <sdk>	Yes. It returns the PATH of Xauthority file
Oct 11 22:39:36 <bugs_>	does it show a path of /run/user/nnnn/gdm/Xauthority?
Oct 11 22:39:41 <bugs_>	or a home directory path
Oct 11 22:39:58 <bugs_>	(i am assuming you are using Xorg and not Wayland)
Oct 11 22:41:52 <sdk>	homedir path. I don't have a Display Manager nor a DE. I autostart X in .bash_profile.
Oct 11 22:42:31 <bugs_>	so your .bash_profile/.bashrc is setting XAUTHORITY?
Oct 11 22:43:14 <bugs_>	if it is try commenting that out log out log back in
Oct 11 22:43:20 <sdk>	.bash_profile run `startx`
Oct 11 22:43:41 <sdk>	but there's nothing about .Xauthority in it.
Oct 11 22:46:06 <bugs_>	your DISPLAY is ":0"?
Oct 11 22:46:14 <sdk>	Yep
Oct 11 22:46:36 <bugs_>	bummer - the only other thing i can think of is some kind of file lock
Oct 11 22:46:43 <bugs_>	is the home directory on an nfs volume?
Oct 11 22:47:10 <sdk>	Nope. ext4 in LVM
Oct 11 22:47:51 <bugs_>	rofl how about two users with the same uid
Oct 11 22:48:31 <bugs_>	something is stopping the software from reading the contents of .Xauthority
Oct 11 22:48:40 <bugs_>	or the contents of .Xauthority don't match
Oct 11 22:49:03 <bugs_>	i've also seen that when the home dir volume was 100% full
Oct 11 22:49:19 <Peetz0r>	Hey! I just upgraded to F31, but display color profiles and night light seem to be broken. I found this bug online and it is reported as "already fixed" yesterday. I think it's this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760254
Oct 11 22:49:36 <Peetz0r>	so why is it still broken on my system? I did upgrade everything and reboot
Oct 11 22:49:42 <sdk>	bugs_: Plenty of space. I'll check the id thingy
Oct 11 22:50:10 <bugs_>	yeah if you have two different usernames logged in with the same uid that
Oct 11 22:50:12 <bugs_>	can do it
Oct 11 22:51:09 <Peetz0r>	according to https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/desktop-linux/1131732-gnome-shell-mutter-3-34-1-deliver-on-their-prominent-fixes/page3 the fixes should have been available as updates yesterday already
Oct 11 22:51:32 <sdk>	bugs_: nope it isn't the id.
Oct 11 22:52:08 <bugs_>	i guess next i'd run "lsof | grep Xauthority
Oct 11 22:52:16 <sdk>	Strange. I run mostly the same settings on Debian and Arch without any trouble :/
Oct 11 22:52:18 <bugs_>	see if something else has it open
Oct 11 22:52:36 <bugs_>	do you have a config file in your .ssh
Oct 11 22:52:52 <sdk>	Yes I have.
Oct 11 22:53:06 <Peetz0r>	in other news, is koji offline?
Oct 11 22:53:43 <bugs_>	i might rename that config temporarily and see if that helps
Oct 11 22:54:01 <bugs_>	outer limits music is starting to play
Oct 11 22:55:20 <sdk>	Yep that's weird because I can pinpoint what's triggering it. I'll try renaming the file but I'll have to wait a bit to see if it will happen again. Thanks for the help.
Oct 11 22:55:33 <bugs_>	ok weird problem
Oct 11 22:55:59 <bugs_>	i worry about algo changes in ssh and ssl triggering something like this
Oct 11 22:56:27 <bugs_>	sometimes they disable a cipher you are using etc
Oct 11 22:57:16 <sdk>	We'll see. I'll try to remember what i'm doing right before it happens.
Oct 11 22:57:38 <bugs_>	oh i've had that happen when i su
Oct 11 23:28:24 <fdelapena>	hey guys are you able to dnf install python3-slugify or is also broken for you?

Oct 12 00:09:36 <nbags>	i've just switched to gnome-shell. having an issue where the Super-#keys (e.g. Super-1 to launch the first favourite app in the panel) is clashing with shortcuts i've created to switch between workspaces. how do i disable these favourite app shortcuts?
Oct 12 00:17:55 <kk4ewt>	settings keyboard-shortcuts
Oct 12 00:22:11 <nbags>	kk4ewt: where? i can't see an option to disable these favourites shortcuts
Oct 12 00:23:26 <kk4ewt>	there is always the tweaktool and gnomeshell-extensions
Oct 12 00:33:54 <nbags>	kk4ewt: i've looked in tweak tool
Oct 12 00:36:34 <nbags>	and a can't see an extension for this
Oct 12 00:43:18 <nbags>	ok, well here is the workaround: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1250

Oct 12 13:32:18 <yasumi2136>	i run on F30 LXDE with a laptop but my touchpad doesn't work for tap to click. I followed this page : https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_enable_touchpad_click#Other_window_managers , rebooted my system but still not working, any ideas?
Oct 12 13:33:26 <yasumi2136>	when i type echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE i get "x11" so i don't use Wayland
Oct 12 13:36:27 <diogenes_>	yasumi2136, afaik lxde is not developed anymore.
Oct 12 14:49:40 <Ilgaz>	I think kvirc crashed. I don't know if I could send my message or not. Here is the interesting thing. Fedora 30 is the only distro that can boot flawlessly on my HP Pavillion x360
Oct 12 14:50:01 <Ilgaz>	but fedora 31 freezes on boot, with only cursor appearing.
Oct 12 14:50:47 <Ilgaz>	I don't think a single byte of log etc produced as it is very early stage. I thought I better report this.
Oct 12 14:52:26 <Ilgaz>	I am downloading "rawhide" iso now. BTW, as you may guess, Live 31 beta ISO USB fails with same symptom too.
Oct 12 14:55:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Have you pressed "ESC" at the earliest Point, you can do that? You should see some errors, "behind"...
Oct 12 14:55:55 <Ilgaz>	No it is like nightmare for me and developers, nothing is written on screen or I would take a photo even
Oct 12 14:56:45 <Ilgaz>	Something in 30 stable makes it possible to boot, it doesn't exist on 31. Is the Kernel too different?
Oct 12 14:56:55 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: ouh, good luck!
Oct 12 14:56:56 <Khaytsus>	Kernel is different yes.
Oct 12 14:57:13 <whise_buddha>	I guess, Fedora 31 should use 5.3.5, am I right?
Oct 12 14:58:03 <Ilgaz>	Actually this is my 2nd Fedora install. I went frustrated with Broadcom 43142 not working so deleted it, reinstalled today so I can report things to developers&maintainers
Oct 12 14:58:59 <whise_buddha>	When it is you second install, dont use BETA.
Oct 12 14:59:08 <Ilgaz>	31, when working, at least initilized Broadcom 43142 without any networks visible. I was trying to re-create same setup.
Oct 12 14:59:10 <Khaytsus>	Ilgaz: where does it boot to?  You see grub?  Have you turned off rhgb and quiet?  maybe basic video?
Oct 12 14:59:16 <whise_buddha>	I guess the best way for you is to use STABLE
Oct 12 15:00:08 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: I am kinda used to pass parameters so yes, I removed hrgb and quiet, added verbose acpi=off
Oct 12 15:00:19 <Khaytsus>	and where does it boot to?
Oct 12 15:00:44 <Ilgaz>	Would adding vga=788 from Debian be a voodoo magic or would help anything on Intel HD 5500?
Oct 12 15:00:49 <Khaytsus>	no..
Oct 12 15:01:00 <Khaytsus>	that just sets the console mode, no point in that
Oct 12 15:01:37 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: Just a non blinking cursor with entire system frozen, external USB devices not powered back, caps lock led not working. Even CPU fan stopped
Oct 12 15:02:06 <Khaytsus>	so grub to blank screen and that's it?
Oct 12 15:02:25 <Ilgaz>	Yes. But Fedora 30 boots (the kernel from fedora 30)
Oct 12 15:02:56 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Is it an Option for you to install fedora 30 and then upgrade to fedora 31 BETA via dnf?
Oct 12 15:03:25 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I did exactly that. So, Fedora 30 kernel remains, 31 exists but doesn't boot
Oct 12 15:04:37 <Ilgaz>	I am particularly sad since fedora workstation is _the_ ideal distro for 2 in 1 laptop. It even figures the device concept change and shows virtual keyboard etc
Oct 12 15:05:19 <Ilgaz>	I will try the rawhide iso now. bbl
Oct 12 15:05:35 <whise_buddha>	Which Device is disfunctional in fedora for you, so that might be the reason for updating to Fedora 31?
Oct 12 15:06:14 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: broadcom 43142, a very particular hardware revision that is a nightmare to init
Oct 12 15:06:26 <whise_buddha>	is it wifi or bluetooth?
Oct 12 15:06:52 <Ilgaz>	a laptop without wireless is comical you know. Both wireless&bluetooth . I don't really care about bluetooth right now
Oct 12 15:07:38 <leden>	Ilgaz: did you install rpmfusion repos
Oct 12 15:07:41 <whise_buddha>	okay, so Fedora 30 can boot, but without wifi running, right?
Oct 12 15:07:41 <Ilgaz>	I even installed the dkms driver, didn't help. It was at least showing on 31
Oct 12 15:07:55 <Ilgaz>	ledeni: yes, I got the dkms one from them
Oct 12 15:08:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Did you see that: https://tanmaync.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/install-broadcom-bcm43142-wifi-drivers-fedora/
Oct 12 15:08:28 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: yes, it was my first attempt
Oct 12 15:08:41 <Ilgaz>	It makes perfect sense however, it doesn't work
Oct 12 15:09:03 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: sry, but I cant help you. :(
Oct 12 15:09:16 <whise_buddha>	good luck!
Oct 12 15:09:20 <Ilgaz>	The idea is reporting these things with proper lspci -vvv etc so people won't live the issues
Oct 12 15:10:04 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I am staring to an illuminated windows 10 dedicated key on this laptop, I mean this is like level 99 for Linux distros :-)
Oct 12 15:10:28 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: If it doenst work, think about to buy a USB-Stick with a supported wifi chip. It is very cheap, so.... ^^
Oct 12 15:11:26 <Ilgaz>	It seems like the only solution now, well, I keep reporting.
Oct 12 15:12:34 <Ilgaz>	BTW, in case anyone uses the official way to install broadcom from rpmfusion , there is a very interesting trick which is needed. You need to disable safeboot to modprobe wl
Oct 12 15:52:14 <f380cedric>	Hi, I'm trying to set my environment in wayland, but I cannot figure out why it's not working. I am setting my variables in .config/environment.d/99-defaults.conf. They don't appear in printenv nor systemctl --user show-environment. Any idea?

Oct 13 19:32:07 <malarivi>	I am trying to get prefix delegation handoff from my Fedora 30 Edge router to my internal 3750E switch. Has anyone done something like this? All I have running is nmcli with the eui64 address scheme
Oct 13 19:32:25 <malarivi>	I'm on ATT fiber with that horrible PACE router in passthru mode
Oct 13 19:44:44 <plarsen>	malarivi, I've tried with comcast but their instructions doesn't seem to work for IPv6 - no matter what I do for prefix deligation nothing seems to work.
Oct 13 19:45:00 <plarsen>	So if you find something that explains a methodology to follow please share :D
Oct 13 19:46:53 <plarsen>	Problem I have is that every IP in the prefix range is rejected by comcast ...
Oct 13 19:47:12 <malarivi>	I got it working using the 2001:DB8::1/64 with the radvd method but I want multicast working since we dont use RF cable anymore at home
Oct 13 19:48:17 <malarivi>	@plarsen what does your nmcli output look like for your wan interface? lets exchange notes? I see a /128, a /64 and a /60
Oct 13 19:49:48 <plarsen>	malarivi, ahhh, well I reset it all and this was done on CentOS6 when I struggled with it a few months ago.   I reverted everything to IPv4 only until I find a better option. I'll probably go the UniFi security gate route and leave my current CentOS box to be completely upgraded and reset, and just handle my internal lab stuff and not be the external edge router.
Oct 13 19:50:07 <plarsen>	Sorry - I wish I hadn't done that. I would love to have exchanged settings.
Oct 13 19:50:26 <plarsen>	CentOS6 != nmcli
Oct 13 19:50:42 <plarsen>	It's all the old network scripts.
Oct 13 19:51:34 <malarivi>	plarsen, check your channels for my msg. Should give some perspective
Oct 13 20:47:38 <first-order>	What if they replaced Fedora Branched with a rolling Fedora Stream implementation, and then had stable Fedora inbetween that and CentOS Stream?
Oct 13 20:58:09 <billings>	CentOS stream is just CentOS 8 with updates that will be in the next point release of CentOS
Oct 13 20:58:29 <billings>	if you want something like that, just turn on updates-testing
Oct 13 20:58:45 <billings>	or rawhide, I suppose, depending on your perspective
Oct 13 21:01:32 <Comnenus>	Has anyone gotten chrome-remote-desktop to work?  I have chrome and chromium installed, installed the chrome-remote-desktop package from repo, go to remotedesktop.google.com and install the extension.  Then it never prompts to enter the host information, I'm in a continuous loop  between remotedesktop.google.com and remotedesktop.google.com/access

Oct 18 15:53:28 <codebam>	ohhh I think I discovered the issue
Oct 18 15:53:29 <codebam>	so
Oct 18 15:53:36 <codebam>	I changed my username
Oct 18 15:53:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	whats the issue
Oct 18 15:53:48 <codebam>	and it seems to be looking in my old home folder
Oct 18 15:54:13 <codebam>	but I'm not exactly sure how to fix that. I could just create a folder and symlink it to my new home folder I guess
Oct 18 15:54:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	so everything works with a new user?
Oct 18 15:54:29 <codebam>	but there should be an option somewhere to remove that
Oct 18 15:54:49 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem I assume it would? considering the error I'm getting is just that it can't access the old images folder
Oct 18 15:55:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	so this is a PEBCAK
Oct 18 15:55:11 <codebam>	I haven't set up a new user yet
Oct 18 15:55:15 <codebam>	PEBCAK?

Oct 18 16:06:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	there will be a GO/NO-GO next thursday
Oct 18 16:06:52 <temple48>	goodness, feels like f30 was just a couple weeks ago
Oct 18 16:07:01 <coz_>	:)
Oct 18 16:07:22 <codebam>	where can I get signify on fedora?
Oct 18 16:07:42 <codebam>	why isn't it just in the official repos? isn't that like a standard package?
Oct 18 16:08:27 <Khaytsus>	temple48: Itw as.. for me ;)
Oct 18 16:08:43 <temple48>	Khaytsus: exactly
Oct 18 16:08:58 <Khaytsus>	Mostly because I hadn't had a spare round to it
Oct 18 16:09:03 <temple48>	got my last f29 machine up to f30 like a week ago, yeah
Oct 18 16:09:15 <temple48>	and now, kernel 5.3.6. amazing how quickly things move
Oct 18 16:30:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, because it isnt (not in fedora or rpmfusion
Oct 18 16:33:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, and when i google signify i am not finding anything that looks like FOSS
Oct 18 16:33:52 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem https://github.com/aperezdc/signify
Oct 18 16:34:17 <codebam>	although I don't know if that's the official version. it's an openbsd tool
Oct 18 16:34:28 <codebam>	it's just as FOSS as OpenSSH is
Oct 18 16:36:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, so why do you need it when rpms are signed
Oct 18 16:37:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	(it appears you love installing things from outside the distro so nm)
Oct 18 16:45:28 <idlemind>	codebam what do you have for: virsh -c qemu:///session pool-dumpxml gnome-boxes
Oct 18 16:47:44 <idlemind>	might just need to delete that storage pool (or move it and it edit the path of the storage pool). if you delete it and want it to be recreated you could try closing gnome-boxes and set the first-run flag on the app: gsettings set org.gnome.boxes first-run true

Nov 07 14:10:49 <RMPR>	Hello, is there any reason for fedora maintainers to not package apache netbeans ?
Nov 07 14:14:55 <RMPR>	More specifically, my problem is I installed netbeans 11.2 from flatphub and I wasn't satisfied because I couldn't change the jdk version
Nov 07 14:15:12 <Khaytsus>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/NetBeans is the documented, suggested method.
Nov 07 14:16:03 <billings>	The package was orphaned because the maintainer never treid to get it to build on Fedora 30
Nov 07 14:16:38 <billings>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1675447 is the BZ showing that the packager got ample notice
Nov 07 14:17:16 <billings>	although I think there was a discussion on fedora-devel about how the java package maintainers were just ignoring email from bugzilla because they got so much
Nov 07 14:17:57 <knstn>	"alternatives --list" could be messing you out
Nov 07 14:21:39 <RMPR>	Khaytsus: thanks, although I'm still wondering why it's not packaged
Nov 07 14:22:50 <RMPR>	knstn: yeah it's useful only when you don't use the flatpak, because it comes with his own jdk.
Nov 07 14:23:05 <RMPR>	and you can't change that.
Nov 07 14:24:02 <billings>	it isn't packaged because the package maintainer stopped maintaining it.  It was retired.
Nov 07 14:24:33 <billings>	Fedora is a community maintained linux distro
Nov 07 14:25:21 <RMPR>	billings: yh
Nov 07 14:26:07 <billings>	yh?
Nov 07 14:27:29 <RMPR>	for yeah
Nov 07 14:27:59 <billings>	ok.
Nov 07 14:28:10 <billings>	That's short for "Okay" in case you were wondering.

Nov 07 18:54:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	bbigby64, did you see if there was an eclipse from modular ?
Nov 07 18:54:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	or copr
Nov 07 19:35:21 <hjek>	Hi, on my Fedora installation here, in Gnome Software I have 3 apps that are stuck in that they are "pending" installation. They persist even when restarting Gnome Software or Fedora. I can't cancel them, and when clicking on the check mark button the cancel button is also grayed out. I wonder, how can I reset or clear the Gnome Software (or PackageKit..?) install queue?
Nov 07 19:36:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek,  so if they are persistant time to go to the commandline and see whats up
Nov 07 19:37:34 <hjek>	@Southern_Gentlem: dnf behaves fine. It's only really in Gnome Software this issue is there.
Nov 07 19:37:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	what are the apps
Nov 07 19:37:52 <domhnall>	sounds like you're low on swap
Nov 07 19:37:59 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: programs; pieces of softwage, e.g. Inkscape
Nov 07 19:38:04 <hjek>	Plenty of swap
Nov 07 19:38:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek, so flatpaks
Nov 07 19:38:35 <hjek>	domhnall: 1.5 GB swap free
Nov 07 19:39:10 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: Well, I'm not sure whether the ones that are stuck are flatpaks or not.
Nov 07 19:40:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	uname -r
Nov 07 19:40:14 <hjek>	5.3.8-200.fc30.x86_64
Nov 07 19:40:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	and what happens if you dnf install inkscape
Nov 07 19:42:25 <hjek>	So, it installs fine. But it's still listed as pending in Gnome Software, and every time I open Gnome Software I get this error popup that the app failed to install because it's "not compatible"...
Nov 07 19:42:33 <knstn>	I would also suggest "pkcon repair" && "pkcon refresh"
Nov 07 19:44:45 <hjek>	knstn: that fixed it. cool
Nov 07 19:45:51 <hjek>	ah, so that's the packagekit CLI..! interesting. didn't know about that one.
Nov 07 19:46:33 <hjek>	i'm not going to report this one as a bug unless I can figure out how to reproduce it. not sure how it happened.
Nov 07 19:47:05 <hjek>	knstn: No! They came back now, the apps, as "pending"!
Nov 07 19:49:37 <leden>	hjek,'killall gnome-software' &  'rm -rf ~/.cache/gnome-software'
Nov 07 19:52:27 <hjek>	leden: That's one of the first things I tried. I'll try it again, but the "pending" apps remain.
Nov 07 19:53:31 <hjek>	(Maybe I should just upgrade to f31 and see if the issue disappears...)
Nov 07 20:03:17 <leden>	hjek, what exactly apps are
Nov 07 20:04:19 <hjek>	leden: The apps that are stuck here are: calibre, Modem Manager GUI and Table (Inkscape extension)
Nov 07 20:47:00 <brejoc>	Hi folks! Quick question: You have a broken Salt package in Fedora 31 because python3-tornado is too new. Where can I report this?
Nov 07 20:48:46 <noln>	brejoc, "point of contact" at https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/salt
Nov 07 20:48:51 <noln>	brejoc, or channel #fedora-devel
Nov 07 20:49:24 <Khaytsus>	Or log a bug?
Nov 07 20:49:31 *	Khaytsus suggests brejoc try the following URL and let us know if it helps or they need more assistance: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsAndFeatureRequests
Nov 07 20:53:04 <brejoc>	noln: Thanks! Looks like it was already fixed in rawhide. At least the changelog says so.

Dec 08 18:27:07 <latenite>	Hi folks, why does 'dnf remove' remove sooooo many packages? https://paste.ofcode.org/vrDr6nUsHrjC6pzyTpFuNg
Dec 08 18:27:58 <Khaytsus>	Because all those require kf5-kcmutils and then cascades from there
Dec 08 18:29:04 <Khaytsus>	Remove the devel package if you want, but removing the other one will remove most KDE stuff.
Dec 08 18:32:53 <latenite>	Khaytsus, how do I remove a package without removing the stuff that depends on it?
Dec 08 18:33:07 <Khaytsus>	You do not; they depend on it.
Dec 08 18:33:13 <latenite>	Like when I want to reinstall, in case I broke files
Dec 08 18:33:16 <Khaytsus>	Why would you think you need to remove kf5-kcmutils
Dec 08 18:33:31 <Khaytsus>	Why would you have broken files?  What in the world are you doing?  And anyway, dnf has a reinstall option.
Dec 08 18:33:38 <latenite>	like when I removed files of the package
Dec 08 18:33:41 <Khaytsus>	But yeah, if that's a problem, rethink what you're doing.
Dec 08 21:16:30 <abdulocracy>	Hey, after a recent update I've had tearing issues in Firefox
Dec 08 21:17:06 <abdulocracy>	Intel UHD 620 graphics
Dec 08 21:17:28 <abdulocracy>	I run GNOME on Xorg
Dec 08 21:17:47 <abdulocracy>	Previously was fine, happened pretty recently with an update
Dec 08 21:18:23 <abdulocracy>	Any ideas?
Dec 08 21:18:23 <wl_>	an update of what? Firefox, mesa, the kernel?
Dec 08 21:18:46 <abdulocracy>	I don't know, I just do an upgrade once or twice a week
Dec 08 21:20:30 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Tearing on X11 is extremely common.
Dec 08 21:20:42 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: If you don't want tearing, maybe run GNOME on Wayland.
Dec 08 21:21:18 <abdulocracy>	Well I have a more major graphical issue with Wayland
Dec 08 21:21:22 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Every single system I've ever had for close to 2 decades now, has tearing.
Dec 08 21:21:38 <abdulocracy>	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1827
Dec 08 21:22:25 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I have to wonder if that is still the case with all of the updates.
Dec 08 21:23:17 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I'm definitely not claiming that GNOME on Wayland is perfect.
Dec 08 21:24:19 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: But generally speaking, Wayland was created to eliminate a lot of layers that are in X11... but GNOME requires accelerated 3D and that doesn't work so well on a wide range of chipsets.
Dec 08 21:27:07 <abdulocracy>	dowdle, just logged in to Wayland and the issue is definitely still there, no improvement
Dec 08 21:27:54 <abdulocracy>	The weird thing is with F30 it was entirely fine
Dec 08 21:28:14 <abdulocracy>	I used Wayland full time
Dec 08 21:28:55 <Acru>	Hey, whenever I try to report an error with the error reporting tool, I tells me that the retrace job failed, and the log shows that yum failed with the error `ERROR You need to update rpm to handle...`
Dec 08 21:29:00 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I guess differences with different kernel versions... with Fedora trying to follow upstream as much as possible.
Dec 08 21:30:37 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I wish I had a fix for you.  You can go back to Fedora 30 if that helps... although now of course F30 is on the same kernel is F31.
Dec 08 21:32:06 <tairikuookami>	Acru, can you paste the output of 'uname -a' ?
Dec 08 21:32:19 <Acru>	`Linux acr.len 5.3.14-300.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 2 15:41:35 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
Dec 08 21:34:19 <tairikuookami>	when did you last do a 'sudo dnf update' from the command line?
Dec 08 21:34:46 <Acru>	a few hours ago
Dec 08 21:35:54 <tairikuookami>	what's the application that is failing?  have you tried to just open a bugzilla report on it directly?
Dec 08 21:38:10 <Acru>	tairikuookami audacity, gnome-calendar, and fedora media writer
Dec 08 21:38:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami on the `Problem Report` bug?
Dec 08 21:39:34 <tairikuookami>	well, you could file bugzilla on audacity itself for having a problem in the first place.
Dec 08 21:41:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami But wouldnt be that the job of the problem reporting tool?
Dec 08 21:43:06 <tairikuookami>	you're using gnome.  the gnome bug reporting tool is garbage.  it's failing.  sure, if it actually *worked* you could expect it to file a bug on your behalf..  it's broken.  so it's up to you to file the bug report on the things that actually matter, which is more audacity and calendar and much less the bug-reporting-tool.
Dec 08 22:00:49 <Khaytsus>	the problem is not the 'gnome' bug reporting tool.  First off, it's not gnome. Second, yes, sometimes it wants to install a ton of debug stuff to get more data and it fails.  And yes, if you can reproduce the issue just log it manually.  Rather than it being automatic, with no context.
Dec 08 22:25:29 <Acru>	Khaytsus What should I do if I can not reproduce the fault?
Dec 08 22:33:17 <Khaytsus>	Acru: I suppose there's not much you can do.  If you know what might have caused it you could look for and log a bug but without some reproduction steps or notion of how to reproduce it, it'd be difficult for someone else to fix anything
Dec 08 22:33:40 <Acru>	Khaytsus ok, thank you
Dec 08 22:49:33 <cflag>	Greetings, I am attempting to update my grub.cfg and am receiving the error `/usr/sbin/grub2-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1.  Check your device.map.`, as well as `/dev/sdf: open failed: No medium found` which makes sense as there is no /dev/sdf on my system.
Dec 08 22:49:55 <cflag>	Checking /boot I do not seem to have a device.map file at all
Dec 08 22:50:24 <cflag>	There is no entry for /dev/sdf in my fstab
Dec 08 22:53:26 <cflag>	I only got these errors after upgrading to 31
Dec 08 23:10:36 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in the file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:17:19 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in this file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:18:29 <[R]>	we heard you the first time...
Dec 08 23:18:35 <oppiet30>	laughs

Dec 08 23:26:03 <CharlesIC>	hello, i have a new monitor and im wondering if the refresh rate is set low.  how do i see?
Dec 08 23:26:05 <CharlesIC>	in fedora 31
Dec 08 23:26:34 <CharlesIC>	resolution is 3840x2160 / 16:9
Dec 08 23:26:54 <[R]>	xrandr will tell you the refresh rate
Dec 08 23:27:55 <CharlesIC>	   3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:27:56 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:28:00 <CharlesIC>	so it is at 30
Dec 08 23:28:10 <CharlesIC>	   1920x1080     60.00    59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98    60.00
Dec 08 23:28:17 <CharlesIC>	does this mean that i need to change it to 1920/1080 to get 60?
Dec 08 23:28:31 <[R]>	yes
Dec 08 23:28:46 <CharlesIC>	but it says 4096x2160 ... 59.94
Dec 08 23:28:52 <CharlesIC>	does that mean i can get arouind 60 for that one?
Dec 08 23:28:56 <[R]>	maybe
Dec 08 23:28:58 <[R]>	try it and see
Dec 08 23:29:26 <CharlesIC>	so i changed it to 4096x2160 9:5
Dec 08 23:31:13 <CharlesIC>	but how do i verify my current refresh rate?  https://paste.centos.org/view/353c7be1
Dec 08 23:31:23 <CharlesIC>	im on 4096x2160 right now
Dec 08 23:32:51 <CharlesIC>	is it for sure 59.94?
Dec 08 23:32:56 <CharlesIC>	from that output?
Dec 08 23:35:14 <CharlesIC>	oh, it was set at 30
Dec 08 23:35:34 <CharlesIC>	how do i change it to a higher one?
Dec 08 23:35:47 <oppiet30>	read xrandr man page
Dec 08 23:36:05 <CharlesIC>	i mean there is not a gui?
Dec 08 23:37:49 <oppiet30>	All's I see is for resolution.
Dec 08 23:38:07 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 -r 59.94
Dec 08 23:38:16 <CharlesIC>	that doesn't seem to do anything
Dec 08 23:38:31 <CharlesIC>	 3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:38:36 <CharlesIC>	it is still staying at 30
Dec 08 23:40:15 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:40:16 <CharlesIC>	trying this
Dec 08 23:40:18 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 75
Dec 08 23:40:31 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 60
Dec 08 23:40:32 <CharlesIC>	ok the line i just did fixed it
Dec 08 23:40:45 <CharlesIC>	3840x2160     30.00 +  59.94*   50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:40:54 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:41:05 <CharlesIC>	so i guess i need to put this in my .xinitrc
Dec 08 23:41:08 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:41:17 <oppiet30>	You should have a file monitors.xml (~/.config/monitors.xml)
Dec 08 23:41:23 <CharlesIC>	oh, there is no .xinitrc. does fedora still use that?
Dec 08 23:41:39 <CharlesIC>	looking now
Dec 08 23:41:40 <oppiet30>	Edit that file.
Dec 08 23:42:11 <oppiet30>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/861416/changing-refresh-rate-for-specific-monitor
Dec 08 23:42:40 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:42:41 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:42:51 <CharlesIC>	so should i put 60 or 59.94, as xrandr shows that?
Dec 08 23:43:02 <oppiet30>	I don't know.
Dec 08 23:43:12 <CharlesIC>	ok, i changed monitors.xml
Dec 08 23:43:14 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:43:19 <CharlesIC>	it did make the screen way brighter
Dec 08 23:43:55 <oppiet30>	You can google the monitor and look for specs, to see what it will support.
Dec 08 23:44:12 <CharlesIC>	well its set at 59.94 now
Dec 08 23:44:15 <CharlesIC>	it should support 60
Dec 08 23:44:17 <CharlesIC>	big improvement
Dec 08 23:44:22 <oppiet30>	Right
Dec 08 23:44:39 <CharlesIC>	now i can only do standard or dynamic for picture mode
Dec 08 23:44:40 <CharlesIC>	hmm
Dec 08 23:44:43 <CharlesIC>	no longer natural and other stuff
Dec 08 23:44:55 <oppiet30>	:)
Dec 08 23:45:22 <oppiet30>	Are you using gnome?
Dec 08 23:45:26 <CharlesIC>	cinnamon
Dec 08 23:45:33 <oppiet30>	I haven't sed that oneyet
Dec 08 23:45:45 <CharlesIC>	im talking about on my monitor/tv
Dec 08 23:45:49 <CharlesIC>	it previously had 4 modes
Dec 08 23:45:52 <CharlesIC>	now it only has 2, after changing
Dec 08 23:45:59 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:46:19 <CharlesIC>	ok thanks for your help everyone

Jan 02 11:19:01 <GPolonkai>	hello
Jan 02 11:19:44 <GPolonkai>	i just started a system upgrade (initiated from GNOME Software) on Fedora 31, and it’s reeeeeally slow (it’s running for almost 2 hours now, and it’s still at 26%
Jan 02 11:20:11 <GPolonkai>	is there a way to see what’s happening if i don’t have a root password set (thus, i can’t login on tty2..6)
Jan 02 11:35:01 <GPolonkai>	i guess rebooting the machine is a pretty bad idea
Jan 02 11:42:23 <tswsl1989>	I wouldn't advise it. Is there still disk activity? If so then it's probably still running the upgrade, just taking its time.
Jan 02 11:51:09 <Cybertinus>	hello, I'm running Fedora 31 KDE Spin with the XFCE desktop (I switched DE at some point ;) ). I have the XFCE NetworkManager Applet running. But this doesn't support Wireguard VPN tunnels. NetworksManager itself does support it (I can access the tunnel via nmcli). Is there a valid alternative for the NetworkManager Applet for XFCE that does support WireGuard?
Jan 02 11:51:38 <diogenes_>	GPolonkai, while it's upgrading, write an usb stick with Fedora on it, in case something goes wrong, you can re-install.
Jan 02 11:55:55 <topyli>	GPolonkai: you can't login at a tty if you don't have a root password? that's strange. do we have some new tty philosophy on fedora now?
Jan 02 11:56:29 <topyli>	i can login just fine, i just checked
Jan 02 11:57:13 <topyli>	first time in ages i saw a tty by the way :)
Jan 02 12:04:53 <GPolonkai>	tswsl1989: i can’t hear the disk doing something (luckily it has a HDD in it, as it’s a notebook without an HDD activity LED)
Jan 02 12:05:06 <GPolonkai>	diogenese: i always have one with me, just in case :)
Jan 02 12:05:51 <GPolonkai>	topyli: if you press “reboot and install upgrades”, you can’t login as an unprivileged user while the upgrades are running
Jan 02 12:06:33 <topyli>	ah so it's just during an upgrade. right
Jan 02 12:17:54 <GPolonkai>	i decided to go brave and pressed Ctrl-Alt-Delete; now it’s booting up seemingly fine…
Jan 02 12:18:45 <kwizart>	just FYI, a new version of the fedy tool is available, if anyone wants to request improvements of fixes, see also : https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/fedy/
Jan 02 12:57:08 <irreleph4nt>	Hello. I'd like to paste a file to paste.centos.org and am using the corresponding API example given on the website
Jan 02 12:57:20 <irreleph4nt>	but all curl returns is "invalid API key"
Jan 02 12:57:27 <irreleph4nt>	Is the documentation outdated?
Jan 02 12:57:48 <irreleph4nt>	Here is what I tried: curl -d private=1 -d name=irreleph4nt --data-urlencode text@winbinddpipe.ausearch https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 13:02:31 <irreleph4nt>	Okay, having worked around not being able to paste from cli, on to my actual problem: upgrading from fc30 server to fc31 via dnf broke selinux in context of winbind / samba for me
Jan 02 13:02:39 <irreleph4nt>	the AVC messages can be seen here: https://paste.centos.org/view/74081d36
Jan 02 13:03:33 <irreleph4nt>	The issue boils down to selinux denying access to /run/samba/winbindd/pipe for every service under the moon, which in turn renders me unable to use samba AD users to, for example, log in via SSH
Jan 02 13:04:16 <irreleph4nt>	I could create custom policies for each and every service on the box but instead would like to know how to fix this the right way
Jan 02 13:05:14 <irreleph4nt>	The directory and file are labeled like this: https://paste.centos.org/view/75d71b84
Jan 02 13:06:11 <irreleph4nt>	I already tried restorecon -R on the directory which changes the folder and pipe file from a samba label to winbind_var_run_t which does not solve the issue, though
Jan 02 14:08:03 <[adw]>	Hi, has anybody succesfully installed and got to work Unifi-controller on fedora server?

Jan 02 17:21:27 <yates>	are there any known issues getting this iso to boot off of liveusb: F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso
Jan 02 17:21:43 <yates>	?
Jan 02 17:22:25 <yates>	i flashed it using "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M"
Jan 02 17:22:32 <yates>	where "X" is appropriate
Jan 02 17:31:54 <RayTracer>	yates: ensure that there is nothing mounted from the usb (maybe automatically) before running dd
Jan 02 17:35:10 <yates>	i'm using a 4GB usb drive. is that big enough?
Jan 02 17:37:24 <RayTracer>	yates: should be enough, the iso seems to be 1.8GB
Jan 02 17:40:35 <RayTracer>	yates: and, as you're not using eg. "oflag=direct", you should run "sync" before unplugging/resetting
Jan 02 17:41:23 <RayTracer>	yates: besides that, I'm not aware of general issues
Jan 02 17:43:34 <yates>	ok, thanks RayTracer
Jan 02 17:54:22 <kk4ewt>	yates yes i tested that iso on a usb and there was no issue
Jan 02 17:54:41 <kk4ewt>	using dd and livecd-iso-to-disk
Jan 02 17:54:58 <yates>	kk4ewt: thanks - that is a good datapoint
Jan 02 17:55:43 <kk4ewt>	"dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:52 <kk4ewt>	 "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:59 <yates>	i am wondering if my brand of usb is inferior. i tried several attempts of flashes on several machines, none worked
Jan 02 17:56:04 <kk4ewt>	is the command i used
Jan 02 17:56:18 <kk4ewt>	yes you can have bad media
Jan 02 17:56:30 <yates>	it would be multiple bad media
Jan 02 17:56:38 <kk4ewt>	i have seen something say its 4G and only be 256M
Jan 02 17:57:00 <yates>	i tried two+ different pieces of usb by same mfr
Jan 02 17:58:08 <Khaytsus>	If a dd is too big to a media, it'll fail.
Jan 02 17:58:22 <Khaytsus>	Someone probably hasn't checked a checksum or something.
Jan 02 17:58:24 <yates>	it was an el-cheapo 4G usb off amazon
Jan 02 17:58:29 <yates>	i checked
Jan 02 17:59:24 <kk4ewt>	goto walmart and get a good media
Jan 02 18:00:40 <yates>	ha !
Jan 02 18:06:27 <RayTracer>	maybe it's also time to ask how it fails.. like: does the machine boot from usb at all
Jan 02 18:30:54 <yates>	RayTracer: yes, it boots, but after a long time and many dracut timeout messages it throws me into dracut
Jan 02 18:31:18 <yates>	it boots "sorta"
Jan 02 18:35:08 <RayTracer>	yates: maybe a web search for the hardware model reveals some workaround like acpi=off
Jan 02 18:54:41 <yates>	works with an ubuntu live cd
Jan 02 18:55:30 <RayTracer>	ok, this makes it look like it's not that :)
Jan 02 19:01:36 <yates>	lol
Jan 02 19:06:31 <bugs_>	curious about yates computer type
Jan 02 19:06:54 <bugs_>	it sounds like a usb3 / usb2 issue
Jan 02 19:34:33 <razorfreak>	hello, can someone help me with brightness issue? the keys aren't working.
Jan 02 19:34:52 <sfranken>	F lock?
Jan 02 19:35:35 <razorfreak>	other keys are working except the brightness keys
Jan 02 19:36:11 <sfranken>	Is the key mapped to brightness in the settings?
Jan 02 19:36:48 <razorfreak>	when I press the key, brightness logo comes up
Jan 02 19:37:00 <razorfreak>	I think they are mapped
Jan 02 19:37:02 <sfranken>	That would be a "yes", then
Jan 02 19:37:16 <razorfreak>	I run F31, I tried this on F30 also
Jan 02 19:38:03 <razorfreak>	my laptop is DELL XPS 15 7590
Jan 02 19:39:06 <razorfreak>	xbacklight also doesn't work
Jan 02 19:40:28 <sfranken>	Let me check, I have the XPS 15 9560
Jan 02 19:41:31 <sfranken>	hmm, the keys work as expected on that machine
Jan 02 19:42:54 <razorfreak>	sfranken, so is there any way? I have been stuck trying to fix this for the last 3 days
Jan 02 19:43:52 <sfranken>	I don't know. Mine work out of the box...
Jan 02 19:44:30 <sfranken>	You could also adjust it from the menu at the top right, but that's more work
Jan 02 19:44:49 <razorfreak>	that is also not working
Jan 02 19:44:53 <razorfreak>	xrandr seems to be working
Jan 02 19:46:20 <sfranken>	hmm... What GPU is in your machine?
Jan 02 19:46:23 <sfranken>	And wayland or X11?
Jan 02 19:50:09 <razorfreak>	nvidia 1650
Jan 02 19:50:12 <razorfreak>	x11
Jan 02 19:50:38 <sfranken>	Does your laptop have an Intel GPU as well?
Jan 02 19:50:57 <razorfreak>	I think no
Jan 02 19:52:12 <razorfreak>	oh yes, intel uhd graphics 630
Jan 02 19:54:28 <sfranken>	Could you check what happens if you try the keys with the nvidia card blacklisted/disabled in the bios?
Jan 02 19:57:54 <razorfreak>	I am sorry, how do I do that?
Jan 02 20:00:43 <razorfreak>	I found something, I will check this https://nmilosev.svbtle.com/perfection-today-running-fedora-on-dell-xps-7590
Jan 02 20:01:12 <sfranken>	Reboot, and when you see the Dell logo press escape. That should get you into the bootmenu for Fedora (grub). Press E to edit and add "rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau nouveau.modeset=0" at the end of the linux....... line
Jan 02 20:01:57 <sfranken>	Ah, oled screen.. Those can't be changed the same way as other screens
Jan 02 20:03:09 <razorfreak>	so at least it should be handled right?
Jan 02 20:03:10 <sfranken>	(Becuase oled has no conventional backlight, which can't be brightned or dimmed)
Jan 02 20:04:16 <Khaytsus>	sfranken: Sure oled can be dimmed :P  But certainly maybe handled in a different way.
Jan 02 20:04:48 <sfranken>	Khaytsus: Yes it can be dimmed, just not in the conventional way by modifiying the backlight strength
Jan 02 20:05:11 <Khaytsus>	razorfreak: if you can pick a specific intel or nvidia device in the BIOS config, I'd just do that.  Optimus stuff is annoying.
Jan 02 20:13:27 <currybullen>	i've been having some trouble with a bluetooth headset and suspend, where my headset will not reconnect after resuming. i've noticed that it only happens when i do a hybrid suspend, both hibernate and ordinary suspend work fine. when the headset won't reconnect, the only thing that seems to help is a reboot followed by a manual reconnect
Jan 02 20:14:33 <currybullen>	is the bluetooth service not configured to resume after a hybrid suspend or something?
Jan 02 20:14:56 <sfranken>	Like I asked you before: what happens if you disconnect the BT and then reconnect?
Jan 02 20:15:20 <sfranken>	You probably, mostly, have a bluetooth card that doesn't get initialized right after your machines wakes up from suspend
Jan 02 20:16:52 <currybullen>	hmm, how would you like me to disconnect the BT? its integrated into my network card. switching it on and off with rfkill does not help
Jan 02 20:17:07 <sfranken>	From the gnome settings?
Jan 02 20:18:31 <currybullen>	i use cinnamon, which usses blueberry. disabling/enabling it there does nothing. i've also tried blueman with the same result
Jan 02 20:18:59 <shimsh>	chromium-libs-media-freeworld (updates) requires chromium-libs = 77.0.3865.90-2.fc30, but i can't find a matching version anywhere - dnf states the deps are broken too
Jan 02 20:19:07 <sdgathman>	sfranken: I have a similar problem with Intel wifi driver.  I have to remove/reload iwlmvm driver in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/iwlmvm.sh
Jan 02 20:19:11 <shimsh>	anyone else having this issue?
Jan 02 20:19:22 <sdgathman>	And also restart wpa_supplicant
Jan 02 20:20:13 <sdgathman>	Should this be reported as a kernel bug?  Or is the reinitialization supposed to happen in systemd?
Jan 02 20:20:21 <shimsh>	https://fedora.pkgs.org/30/rpmfusion-free-updates-x86_64/chromium-libs-media-freeworld-77.0.3865.90-2.fc30.x86_64.rpm.html
Jan 02 20:35:41 <kwizart>	shimsh, unfortunately chromium-libs-media-freeworld is unmaintained you need to move to chromium-freeworld
Jan 02 20:53:36 <shimsh>	thanks kwizart
Jan 02 20:58:02 <yates>	RayTracer et al: newsflash: the problem with my liveusb was my cheap thumbdrives
Jan 02 20:58:19 <yates>	i used my officemate's thumbdrive and it worked fine
Jan 02 20:58:37 <kk4ewt>	yates told ya
Jan 02 20:59:03 <yates>	...but i'm so glad i saved $10
Jan 02 20:59:23 <yates>	(that's a joke ^^^^^(
Jan 02 21:07:15 <sfranken>	"Yeah, but I save X amount because I buy cheap stuff" ... most people who say that don't realise their cheaper model doesn't last as long, so while I buy 3 expensive drives that last me years, they buy 10 in the same time
Jan 02 21:09:32 <tzfrs>	Hi guys. I broke my system. I added my ssd to fstab, but then wanted to make it work under windows as well so I formatted it to ntfs
Jan 02 21:10:04 <tzfrs>	Now I always get emergency mode where I can't do anything because the root account is locked and I have no live medium
Jan 02 21:10:27 <tzfrs>	Is there a way to boot into a bash without anything being loaded so I can edit the fstab?
Jan 02 21:11:22 <bugs_>	have you tried to boot in run level 1?
Jan 02 21:11:47 <bugs_>	edit the grub boot linux line and add 1 at the end, then boot
Jan 02 21:11:49 <tzfrs>	Do u just need to add a 1 to the end of the boot entry line?
Jan 02 21:11:51 <tzfrs>	Kk
Jan 02 21:12:14 <bugs_>	this is assuming things like the root volume isn't encrypted etc
Jan 02 21:12:21 <tzfrs>	It's not
Jan 02 21:12:45 <tzfrs>	Doesn't look good so far.
Jan 02 21:12:55 <sfranken>	tzrfs: Your SSD can't be found anymore, since the UUID has changed because you repartitioned / reformatted it...
Jan 02 21:13:35 <tzfrs>	Yes I know. But how can I remove the line from fstab?
Jan 02 21:13:40 <bugs_>	ok if the uuid in the grub entries has changed thats not going to work
Jan 02 21:13:55 <sfranken>	vim /etc/fstab tzfrs
Jan 02 21:14:08 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, I don't get any shell
Jan 02 21:14:39 <sfranken>	hmm, right... locked root account and all that
Jan 02 21:14:46 <tzfrs>	Yes
Jan 02 21:14:59 <kawazu>	Boot with the installer usb?
Jan 02 21:15:00 <sfranken>	Phyiscally remove the SSD (disconnect the SATA cable) and boot again
Jan 02 21:15:04 <sfranken>	brb
Jan 02 21:15:11 <tzfrs>	I only have a win USB stick.
Jan 02 21:15:15 <tzfrs>	Which doesn't seem to work.
Jan 02 21:15:35 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, does this really solve it? I mean the wrong entry would still be there wouldn't it?
Jan 02 21:15:56 <bugs_>	another boot option is init=/bin/bash
Jan 02 21:16:03 <bugs_>	but that assumes the grub configuration is ok
Jan 02 21:16:26 <tzfrs>	Where do I put that? Also where the 1 is at the end?
Jan 02 21:16:36 <bugs_>	yes replace the 1
Jan 02 21:16:47 <tzfrs>	K, one sec
Jan 02 21:16:55 <bugs_>	you would have to know how to navigate in an empty environment
Jan 02 21:16:58 <bugs_>	i.e. no path
Jan 02 21:17:45 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:20:08 <tzfrs>	Hm. Somehow I don't think it saved my changes.
Jan 02 21:20:32 <tzfrs>	What was the save and exit cmd for vim again?
Jan 02 21:20:54 <sfranken>	:wq
Jan 02 21:21:04 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:22:21 <sfranken>	But I thought you had "noauto" passed as a mounting option?
Jan 02 21:22:38 <sfranken>	Oh, wait, nvm
Jan 02 21:22:44 <tzfrs>	The file is readomly
Jan 02 21:22:46 *	sfranken is working on too much at the same time
Jan 02 21:22:48 <knaccc>	hey peeps, just wondering: normally fedora is not recommended in production i think because sudden changes may break things in packages. i was wondering if fedora would be suitable in production if you're not really using many packages, e.g. because you're mostly just running java on it with your own download and install of java. or are there other reasons that fedora in production is a bad idea?
Jan 02 21:23:00 <tzfrs>	Can I make it to 777 just for now and change it back again after fixing?
Jan 02 21:23:05 <bugs_>	mount -o remount,rw /
Jan 02 21:23:12 <sfranken>	tzfrs: Remount read-write
Jan 02 21:23:15 <sfranken>	thanks bugs_
Jan 02 21:23:37 <sfranken>	knaccc: Who says Fedora isn't recommended in production?
Jan 02 21:23:50 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:24:02 <sfranken>	(It really depends on your situation, though.. Our school works fine with our Fedora labs)
Jan 02 21:24:06 <knaccc>	sfranken i think most people would say to use centos over fedora in production, because each release of fedora only has 6 months of support
Jan 02 21:25:10 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:25:14 <tzfrs>	Thank you all!
Jan 02 21:25:38 <sfranken>	7 months knaccc. X + 1 where X is the version number. Yes, that's short. Like I said, it depends on what you use the machines for
Jan 02 21:25:57 <sfranken>	As I said: our Fedora lab at the school I work for runs fine. Has been running fine for 4 years now
Jan 02 21:26:04 <sfranken>	with upgrades from release to release
Jan 02 21:27:32 <knaccc>	what i'm scared of is that suddenly the new fedora comes out, and it makes changes that require a couple months of redevelopment of server mainteance and deployment scripts to adapt to, and during that period you aren't able to upgrade yet so miss out on critical security patches
Jan 02 21:28:24 <knaccc>	put it this way: are there huge advantages to being on the latest kernel that fedora has, in terms of better performance/concurrency, or in terms of security hardening?
Jan 02 21:29:09 <knaccc>	or does it not really make a difference whether i'm on kernel 5.3 vs 3.10
Jan 02 21:29:15 <sfranken>	That's why you have a few machines and servers running outside your normal network to test stuff on, right?
Jan 02 21:29:54 <sfranken>	But if you want mission critical and low changes: go centos. Again, depends on what you're going to use them for
Jan 02 21:30:01 <sfranken>	Can't really give you an answer withouth that info
Jan 02 21:30:13 <knaccc>	well yeah it's possible to do my own testing for performance improvements, but impossible for me to do my own testing for security hardening improvements
Jan 02 21:30:51 <knaccc>	for that i need some kind of commentary on what changed between 5.3 vs 3.10 in terms of security hardening
Jan 02 21:31:22 <sfranken>	Wouuldn't the changelogs provide you with that?
Jan 02 21:32:14 <knaccc>	sfranken yeah i'm wondering if anyone has an answer that is better than "go research it yourself"
Jan 02 21:33:31 <sfranken>	I'm not sure you're going to get what you want then..
Jan 02 21:33:41 <knaccc>	e,g, i don't really know how to reason about whether the new "kernel lockdown" changes are a big deal https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aefcf2f4b58155d27340ba5f9ddbe9513da8286d
Jan 02 21:33:49 <sfranken>	AFAIK the kernel release notes are your "goto source" for this kind of info
Jan 02 21:34:13 <knaccc>	yeah finding the release notes is one thing. interpreting the significance of them is an entirely different ball game
Jan 02 21:34:26 <knaccc>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions
Jan 02 21:34:40 <knaccc>	but it's gonna take me probably the whole day at least to try and delve into what all of these things mean
Jan 02 21:35:49 <sfranken>	hmm...
Jan 02 21:36:06 <sfranken>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
Jan 02 21:36:32 <sfranken>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
Jan 02 21:37:48 <knaccc>	ok thanks
Jan 02 21:40:26 <sfranken>	Same goes for CentOS though
Jan 02 21:41:14 <knaccc>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
Jan 02 21:41:37 <knaccc>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
Jan 02 21:42:19 <sfranken>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
Jan 02 21:42:25 <sfranken>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
Jan 02 21:42:59 <sfranken>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
Jan 02 21:43:17 <sfranken>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
Jan 02 21:43:38 <knaccc>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using
Jan 02 21:43:57 <sfranken>	And some driver backports
Jan 02 21:44:16 <sfranken>	Things like CPU support for new(er) Intel/AMD CPU's and stuff like that
Jan 02 21:44:37 <knaccc>	oh interesting, i didn't know about cpu support backports in centos, thanks!
Jan 02 21:45:03 <sfranken>	Not sure about CentOS 7.x though, I'm not running 7.x anymore
Jan 02 21:45:27 <knaccc>	i was told in #centos that centos 8 is currently a bit of a mess in terms of package support
Jan 02 21:45:39 <knaccc>	so to stick to centos 7.7 for now
Jan 02 21:45:41 <sfranken>	It's still rough around the edges, but for me it works
Jan 02 21:45:59 <sfranken>	For what I need CentOS 8 has better support than 7
Jan 02 21:46:07 <knaccc>	what are your needs?
Jan 02 21:46:08 <sfranken>	(Webserver with modern PHP requirements)
Jan 02 21:46:11 <knaccc>	ah ok
Jan 02 21:46:27 <knaccc>	did you hit any snags with centos 8?
Jan 02 21:46:43 <sfranken>	For the webservers I didn't
Jan 02 21:47:11 <sfranken>	for the Python lab we did. We were testing to see if we could move that over to CentOS 8 as well. But Python3 acted strangely with the teachers material
Jan 02 21:47:19 <sfranken>	so we kept Fedora 30 (31 now)
Jan 02 21:49:49 <knaccc>	interesting, thanks
Jan 02 21:51:33 <sfranken>	No problem
Jan 02 22:06:09 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: So you're saying that the CentOS kernel is slow..  the distro that holds the vast majority of servers in the world..  k
Jan 02 22:10:39 <kawazu>	Is the new Ryzen the way to go these days?
Jan 02 22:11:44 <knaccc>	Khaytsus i'm not saying it's slow, i'm wondering whether it is or not. if kernel 5.3 from 2019 is not much faster than kernel 3.10 from 2013, then fine
Jan 02 22:12:17 <prussian>	given RH's backportiness, it's basically impossible to make version upstream to upstream comparisons
Jan 02 22:12:34 <knaccc>	i'm wondering whether new io schedulers optimized for nvme and new thread schedulers will make a big difference or not
Jan 02 22:12:57 <prussian>	best guess is no and RH might just backported it anyhow.
Jan 02 22:13:33 <sfranken>	Only way to know for sure is test on your actual hardware
Jan 02 22:21:36 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: Again, probably _millions_ of servers use CentOS.  So..
Jan 02 22:23:18 <knaccc>	Khaytsus yeah thanks, it's a good point that does make me feel a little better
Jan 02 22:23:47 <knaccc>	it also makes me wonder why the kernel has not made significant enough performance increases in the last 6 years
Jan 02 22:24:02 <knaccc>	significant enough to warrant more people to upgrade
Jan 02 22:24:54 *	Khaytsus facepalms
Jan 02 22:24:54 <prussian>	probably because all the low hanging fruit has been had. also note all the hardware wiggling around certain class of hardware bugs
Jan 02 22:26:04 <prussian>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.
Jan 02 22:26:52 <knaccc>	interesting
Jan 02 22:27:01 <prussian>	I guess?
Jan 02 22:27:37 <prussian>	if you're currently using fedora, you're basically running the near tippy top of what kernel.org is shipping as stable. I'm surprised you haven't had any issues from that.
Jan 02 22:29:54 <yates>	how do you access root in f31 gnome ? i don't just want to sudo a command, i want to log in
Jan 02 22:30:29 <sfranken>	You don't
Jan 02 22:30:44 <sfranken>	You can however `sudo su -`
Jan 02 22:30:53 <yates>	i do
Jan 02 22:30:57 <yates>	and i will
Jan 02 22:31:20 <sfranken>	You could unlock the root account and set a password
Jan 02 22:31:40 <sfranken>	sudo passwd -u root && sudo passwd root
Jan 02 22:32:08 <sfranken>	But not *really* sure that's a sane idea and all, the root acount being scrambled is done for a reason I'm sure
Jan 02 22:37:15 <yates>	to piss people off
Jan 02 22:37:47 <prussian>	if you set your user up as an "administrator" it forgoes asking for a root password.
Jan 02 22:37:55 <prussian>	at least if you installed with anaconda
Jan 02 22:38:51 <sfranken>	Yeah because it's *so* much work to type sudo -i yates
Jan 02 22:39:02 <sfranken>	Sorry, I'm not getting your issue with root being scrambled
Jan 02 22:39:24 <prussian>	it shouldn't even have a password configured, other than an invalid hash "!!"
Jan 02 22:40:28 <yates>	you are free to operate your linux distro how you wish
Jan 02 22:41:06 <sfranken>	True, but why the issue then? Unlock the account and be happy about iut?
Jan 02 22:41:08 <sfranken>	*it
Jan 02 22:41:12 <prussian>	truly
Jan 02 22:41:31 <prussian>	I operate my fedora with all sorts of zany customizations
Jan 02 22:41:45 <prussian>	not sure how having to set up a root password impedes this.
Jan 02 22:42:14 <yates>	the issue is people who think they know how i should use a computer
Jan 02 22:42:22 <yates>	and i am
Jan 02 22:42:45 <prussian>	ight.
Jan 02 23:08:59 <janos_>	i have to agree - freedom of use being a core tenent and all
Jan 02 23:09:16 <janos_>	even if not considered a "best practice"
Jan 02 23:10:32 <sfranken>	Oh I totally agree, it's just that sometimes something is put in place for very good reasons. I hated root access being dropped or locked out, untill I read the reasoning behind it (not Fedora specific, this was in the Ubuntu days for me). After I read that I changed my opinion
Jan 02 23:12:24 <j^2>	i was trying to post something to paste.centos.org, and getting "invalid api key" kicked back, how can i request one?
Jan 02 23:13:05 <sfranken>	How are you trying to post it j^2?
Jan 02 23:13:08 <sfranken>	with fpaste?
Jan 02 23:13:18 <j^2>	curl -d text='this is my text' https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 23:13:23 <j^2>	from the example
Jan 02 23:13:39 <j^2>	i wanted to set up some bash foo to get some autoposting
Jan 02 23:16:10 <sfranken>	Can't you use fpaste in your bash foo then?
Jan 02 23:16:25 <j^2>	i haven't given the fpaste a shot tbh, let me try it out
Jan 02 23:18:26 <j^2>	sfranken, yep, fpaste worked fine. interesting that the direct curl to the API doesn't :-O
Jan 02 23:19:46 <RayTracer>	sudo -i
Jan 02 23:19:58 <j^2>	heh, there's a hard coded API key in fpaste: https://pagure.io/fpaste/blob/master/f/fpaste#_34
Jan 02 23:20:01 <janos_>	if you vi/vim fpaste you'll see why
Jan 02 23:22:05 <j^2>	sfranken, heh, well i can do the create now with curl...
Jan 02 23:22:34 <sfranken>	Is the text you're parsing not fpast'able?
Jan 02 23:23:22 <j^2>	oh no, i was just looking through the readme, saw the curl directly to API so figured i'd give it a shot. There was no place to say "request an API key" hence my poking and asking here
Jan 02 23:24:40 <janos_>	you might want to use fpaste in the script since it will be maintained - like if the api key changes or something else changes
Jan 02 23:25:07 <j^2>	janos, makes sense thank you
Jan 02 23:25:16 <janos_>	yw

Jan 22 11:45:18 <archuserau>	Hey all. Just installed Fedora on an MSI gaming laptop. The only issue is it can only see the nvidia gpu not the integrated intel gpu.
Jan 22 11:49:51 <kwizart>	archuserau, is it disabled in your bios/efi ?
Jan 22 11:51:34 <archuserau>	There is no option for it in my bios. I will check if there is an update
Jan 22 12:00:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: What do you mean by "only see" ? Is it because it only use the nvidia driver or is it because the Intel gpu don't show up in lspci ?
Jan 22 12:03:02 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is it present when you do lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)" ?
Jan 22 12:04:29 <archuserau>	It does not seem to show up in lspci
Jan 22 12:05:08 <archuserau>	Only the nvidia shows up with that command dfstorm
Jan 22 12:06:32 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is you computer a laptop or a desktop ?
Jan 22 12:06:43 <dfstorm>	your*
Jan 22 12:07:18 <archuserau>	Laptop.
Jan 22 12:07:41 <kwizart>	archuserau, which exact model do you have ? are you sure it's an optimus laptop ?
Jan 22 12:07:44 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Sorry.. I just saw you already said it
Jan 22 12:08:06 <archuserau>	kwizart: There is a gpu button that works in windows
Jan 22 12:08:12 <archuserau>	dfstorm: no worries.
Jan 22 12:09:16 <dfstorm>	archuserau: As root, is the directory "/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/" present ?
Jan 22 12:09:59 <archuserau>	dfstorm: Doesnt seem to be
Jan 22 12:10:03 <ossifrage>	I'm stuck running an old kernel (4.19.8) after my last reboot VirtualBox decided to stop working throwing a VERR_VM_DRIVER_VERSION_MISMATCH
Jan 22 12:10:04 <dfstorm>	archuserau: And are you using the laptop display or a pluged in display ?
Jan 22 12:10:16 <archuserau>	Using the laptop display.
Jan 22 12:10:25 <ossifrage>	I'm having trouble picking all the matched versions to get things to work again
Jan 22 12:11:14 <ossifrage>	I have the kmod-VirtualBox-4.19.8-300, but it seems that something else is wrong
Jan 22 12:12:31 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Well, you're having the same kind of laptop that I have; Optimus is not supported "natively". You're saying there is a "physical switch" to switch between nvidia and intel ?
Jan 22 12:12:57 <archuserau>	dfstorm: It is a button not a switch. In windows it work. In linux it doesnt.
Jan 22 12:13:06 <archuserau>	It is a MSI GT75vr
Jan 22 12:13:40 <archuserau>	What laptop do you have dfstorm ?
Jan 22 12:13:44 <ossifrage>	It was working fine before the reboot, I didn't think anything had changed and I had a vm running prior to reboot
Jan 22 12:13:59 <archuserau>	Give me a minute. I will boot into a different linux distro and see what happens.
Jan 22 12:14:50 <dfstorm>	archuserau: My guess is that by default your system will boot on nvidia.
Jan 22 12:15:10 <archuserau>	I am a little bit disapointed that I cannot turn the nvidia card off in the bios.
Jan 22 12:15:33 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Welcome to the "blackboxed" land of gaming laptop :(
Jan 22 12:15:52 <archuserau>	What do you mean blackboxed? What do you have?
Jan 22 12:16:00 <dfstorm>	archuserau:  I have a System76 Oryx 4
Jan 22 12:16:13 <archuserau>	Same issue?
Jan 22 12:17:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Me I need to get the "system76 power" utility ported to fedora to make my life easier. If not fedora is unusable (Nouveau don't work and is loaded by default.. just to say that)
Jan 22 12:18:23 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should look into other user with your hardware using linux. Often what work for one distribution will work for you too
Jan 22 12:18:37 <archuserau>	I will have a look
Jan 22 12:19:53 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Blackboxed = Manifacturer include stuff (like your button) without any documentation and they won't give away their source code. They just give a "windows specific" driver that won't work on linux...
Jan 22 12:20:43 <dfstorm>	Most of manufacturers*
Jan 22 12:22:51 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should try Archlinux if you know linux. Just boot the liveUSB then do the command I gave you
Jan 22 12:23:09 <dfstorm>	lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
Jan 22 12:24:06 <dfstorm>	And if your Intel card shows up, then you know it's a fedora automation that make the problem (even if it probably help in most of usercase)
Jan 22 12:35:17 <archuserau>	It looks like the issue is the hardware switch only works in windows. I just booted into windows pressed the button and i am now in linux with intel graphics

Jan 22 14:41:06 <CPrompt^>	good morning.  I have been getting a lot of segmentation faults when running dnf update lately.
Jan 22 14:41:33 <CPrompt^>	has anyone else seen this?  Looking through the bug tracker, I can't find a newer report
Jan 22 14:48:33 <Khaytsus>	CPrompt^: Look for other segfaults..  segfaults indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:49:06 <Khaytsus>	Could also be if you have a VPS or something that's VERY low spec and it literally runs out of ram, but that's generally not a segfault.
Jan 22 14:51:54 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: ah...I didn't realie that running dnf and it returning a segfault would indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:51:57 <CPrompt^>	Thanks!
Jan 22 15:00:07 <Khaytsus>	Segfaults can be sw but most often they are hw..
Jan 22 15:17:43 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: thanks.  I will look through some logs and see if I see anything.  I did see in "messages" that there might be an issue with an external drive.

Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	Hello all, I've just moved to Fedora from Ubuntu migrating my home directory from the former to my Fedora installation. It looks like Nautilus is in some ways still using the Yaru dark theme but I can't seem to find the file / setting to change it. As it is only the file preview pane is black (with black text) and the selection in the sidebar is black instead of Adwaita blue. Gnome software has similiarly weird dark
Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	color usages. I tried finding css files (nautilus.css, gtk.css) in my home dir that would create this problem but have had no luck. I've also tried changing and resetting the theme with Gnome Tweaks. Any further suggestions would be greatly appreciated
Jan 22 16:18:09 <prussian>	you might have to reset all your gconf settings.
Jan 22 16:18:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	chasinglogic[m], remove the files form your .config in your /home
Jan 22 16:18:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	control-h to view hidden folders
Jan 22 16:19:29 <prussian>	assuming you have checked the appropriate locations for theming and configuration, as pointed out above ^ ~/.config/gtk-3.0
Jan 22 16:25:16 <chasinglogic[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: Some deep dark file in .config was the problem, clearing nearly everything out of there worked
Jan 22 16:25:26 <chasinglogic[m]>	thanks both of you
Jan 22 16:28:34 <chasinglogic[m]>	Though it looks like Gnome Software still has the leftover dark theme in weird places
Jan 22 16:28:42 <chasinglogic[m]>	all of the tiles on the explore page
Jan 22 16:32:05 <chasinglogic[m]>	I am incorrect, logging out and back in fixed the gnome software issues as well
Jan 22 16:34:17 <prussian>	cool
Jan 22 16:34:19 <prussian>	good deal

Feb 19 14:24:50 <sohamg>	Hey im experiencing a bug(?) in F31 where i cannot lock the screen. The keyboard shortcut/panel button/timeout all result in the panel flashing which im assuming is a gnome shell crash. It used to trigger ARBT but now that i want to report it (im new to reporting etc) ARBT doesnt trigger. How would I get the logs/diagnostic info in this case?
Feb 19 14:26:31 <sohamg>	I think the 2nd to last update did this. Im on intel+nvidia/x11

Feb 28 21:58:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	lxde
Feb 28 21:58:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	i recommend no less than 50 for a Desktop environment
Feb 28 21:59:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	actually the smallest by live iso size is SOAS
Feb 28 22:02:32 <BlackMage>	50GB?!
Feb 28 22:02:51 <Khaytsus>	To use it as a normal daily system, yes
Feb 28 22:02:57 <Khaytsus>	For a random VM you
Feb 28 22:03:02 <Khaytsus>	you're not actively using, 20 is enough
Feb 28 22:14:13 <BlackMage>	only for building smaller programs, router firmware and trying out different things
Feb 28 22:14:57 <daniel-wtd>	BlackMage: it really depends on what you want to do. a minimal fedora installation with blackbox can be ~2GB disk space. Fedora Workstation recommends 20GB, which is sufficient for a small kiosk-like machine. If you want to have a ton of applications, photos, music, you have to count them in.
Feb 28 22:31:26 <BlackMage>	no, only a ton of libs required forbuilding
Feb 28 22:32:35 <BlackMage>	*for building
Feb 28 23:24:07 <BlackMage>	and lxde is the smallest gui?

Feb 29 15:53:55 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380 All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 16:12:51 <akik>	when installing a new kernel through dnf upgrade, the dkms stage takes too much cpu (the heat increases to the critical level) and crashes my laptop
Feb 29 16:13:00 <akik>	is there some way to limit that?
Feb 29 16:19:59 <Khaytsus>	akik: What is using dkms?  Most things on Fedora are akmod.  Plus....  how weak is your laptop that it can't compile a kernel module?
Feb 29 16:20:19 <akik>	Khaytsus: i have the wlan module installed through dkms
Feb 29 16:25:19 <avensurha>	akik: man cpupower-frequency-set
Feb 29 16:26:13 <fedbot>	*** F31-20200224 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2  Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins  ***
Feb 29 16:28:35 <akik>	avensurha: i need to install that. what do you mean by it?
Feb 29 16:29:14 <Khaytsus>	Maybe hit your fan with some pressurized air..  your laptop should never shut down because it's busy, especially not on a build which should take about 10s
Feb 29 16:34:10 <avensurha>	akik: you can limit your CPU frequency with it. it's part of kernel-tools package
Feb 29 16:35:06 <akik>	i'll try cpulimit as a first test if that'll work
Feb 29 16:35:26 <akik>	avensurha: do you mean changing the cpu governor?
Feb 29 16:35:58 <caterfxo>	akik: a google search returns suggestions like `cputool`, `cpulimit`
Feb 29 16:36:15 <avensurha>	akik: yes. and if i remember correctly, you can also set the max freq manually with it
Feb 29 16:41:26 <caterfxo>	possibly `renice`
Feb 29 16:46:36 <caterfxo>	`cool-retro-term`... probabably not so much
Feb 29 16:48:12 <Khaytsus>	I've never once had a machine that gets to any kind of 'critical temperature' doing anything.  that _screams_ something is wrong.
Feb 29 16:48:30 <Khaytsus>	Hot enough to throttle?  Perhaps, but not in the time it'd take to compile something small.
Feb 29 16:51:38 <akik>	Khaytsus: it's an old laptop. i have no high requirements for it
Feb 29 16:51:45 <ncuxo>	Hello I'm back ;D
Feb 29 16:51:58 <caterfxo>	me neither. maybe a stethescope would have revealed the laptop whispering, 'help me get hotter!'
Feb 29 16:52:29 <akik>	it run plasma 5 reqlly well though
Feb 29 16:52:34 <Khaytsus>	I'm guessing the fan is shot or clogged up.
Feb 29 16:52:44 <Khaytsus>	Hit it with some canned air, seriously
Feb 29 16:52:56 <ncuxo>	leden: I've reinstalled fedora and updated to 5.5.6 without an issue. I'm on 5.5.6 with the nvidia driver from the rpm fusion repo but there is a problem I have screen tear on my menu
Feb 29 16:53:35 <Khaytsus>	I had a laptop at work that kept getting jaggy on me, throttling.  I hit it with some canned air and it FILLED my office with dust.  I took it outside to hit it again, more plumes of dust.  No idea why it was so bad, office is not a dirty place.
Feb 29 16:53:41 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps because the laptop was eating it all
Feb 29 16:53:59 <Khaytsus>	After that no more jagginess..  it was actually able to keep cool
Feb 29 16:54:27 <ncuxo>	now I remember why I skipped this guide when I tryed to isntall nvidia before and moved to the nvidia xxx .run
Feb 29 16:54:51 <Khaytsus>	dnf install akmod-nvidia
Feb 29 16:54:52 <Khaytsus>	done
Feb 29 16:54:58 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: If you install the .run, you're on your own.
Feb 29 16:55:31 <short-bike>	Anyone else getting md5 mismatches on a DNF update - the 2 that dnf have failed on are 1) kernel-devel 5.5.6-201.fc31.x86_64.drpm and 2) selinux-policy-targeted-3.14.4-49.fc31.noarch.drpm: ? I have already run dnf clean all and re-tried the update. Same errors appear.
Feb 29 16:55:33 <ncuxo>	oh I couldn't upgrade from 5.4.19 thus I was recommended to reinstall :D
Feb 29 16:55:50 <jell48>	hi, im getting error from "curl https://google.com -v" in chrooted environment "* Unable to initialize NSS database"..."curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)", the db files exist in /etc/pki/nssdb/ directory. is there a way to find out which lib or component is missing?

Feb 29 16:56:35 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: very true. Will sleep the update for 30 mins. Thank you bud.
Feb 29 16:56:36 <avensurha>	Khaytsus: @nvidia .run
Feb 29 16:57:55 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: When I see that, it's typically short lived..  might go away on dnf clean all, may not.  Rarely have I seen it actually bug me beyond just trying to do an update, although I generally just dnf update nightly so I never do it manually
Feb 29 16:58:39 <akik>	ok cpulimit -i -l 50 worked. i see "make -j4" in the output
Feb 29 16:58:59 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: makes sense - but this is a fairly new install so updates are manually triggered ATM.
Feb 29 16:58:59 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: https://paste.centos.org/view/efeece9b
Feb 29 16:59:27 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: gotcha.  Yeah try clean all, if it fails, clean all again..  i think each time it'll generally wind up on a different mirror heh
Feb 29 16:59:37 <Uniaika>	hello
Feb 29 17:00:15 <Khaytsus>	libwebsockets has been failing me for a long time though, I just ran dnf update here for giggles to see if I was seeing any issues.
Feb 29 17:00:17 <Uniaika>	Since upgrading today, a couple of binaries on my system crash with the infamous "*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated"
Feb 29 17:00:35 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Updating how?
Feb 29 17:00:41 <Uniaika>	sudo dnf upgrade -y
Feb 29 17:00:43 <Uniaika>	nothing fancy
Feb 29 17:01:13 <Uniaika>	but the crashing binaries don't come from the Fedora repos.
Feb 29 17:01:22 <Khaytsus>	k...
Feb 29 17:01:29 <Khaytsus>	So...  they're broken?
Feb 29 17:01:33 <Uniaika>	(more precisely, they are `nix` utilities and the haskell `stack` tool)
Feb 29 17:01:55 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: up until yesterday everything worked perfectly
Feb 29 17:02:05 <Uniaika>	has there been any ABI change as of recently?
Feb 29 17:02:21 <Uniaika>	I am not a C programmer, so I have no bloody idea about the root cause of all this
Feb 29 17:03:29 <short-bike>	Uniaika: point release update of version upgrade (ie 30 -> 31 etc) ?
Feb 29 17:03:41 <short-bike>	s/of/or*
Feb 29 17:03:47 <Khaytsus>	Sounds like he just did a normal package update, not a distro update
Feb 29 17:03:51 <Uniaika>	nope, still running 30
Feb 29 17:04:04 <Khaytsus>	30lyfe..  I really need to udpate myself
Feb 29 17:04:14 <Khaytsus>	51 days, 21 hours, 55 minutes, 46 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Feb 29 17:04:46 <Uniaika>	should I maybe upgrade to 31?
Feb 29 17:04:58 <Khaytsus>	I doubt that'd fix your specific issue
Feb 29 17:05:20 <Uniaika>	I'm going to reinstall them manually
Feb 29 17:05:22 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: No idea about haskell, I know Fedora ships it, but I assume not the 'stack' util you mentioned?
Feb 29 17:05:28 <short-bike>	Uniaika: can we se either sysinfo or dnf repolist on a paste first please.
Feb 29 17:06:27 <Uniaika>	short-bike: of course, I'm getting you that
Feb 29 17:09:26 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: I already have this package installed and I still have the screen tear so I don't think the problem comes from there
Feb 29 17:10:24 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: I see minor screen tears here sometimes too, not like it's a big deal
Feb 29 17:11:10 <Uniaika>	short-bike: when you mean "sysinfo", is there a specific packet that provides that command?
Feb 29 17:11:28 <Uniaika>	anyway, here is my repolist https://hastebin.com/zotawutebe.coffeescript
Feb 29 17:11:56 <leden>	ncuxo, can you give us  ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ | fpaste
Feb 29 17:12:11 <short-bike>	Uniaika: fpaste --sysinfo (will generate a URL for posting in here) :)
Feb 29 17:14:23 <Uniaika>	short-bike: here it is! https://paste.centos.org/view/587f7d69
Feb 29 17:14:38 <ncuxo>	leden: https://paste.centos.org/view/efc3656d https://paste.centos.org/view/39e54984
Feb 29 17:14:51 <ncuxo>	first is the dir and the second is the content of the file
Feb 29 17:15:20 <short-bike>	Uniaika: my rationale for that is to see if there are any repo's in there that need to be disabled prior to you going to f31. But I can see from your first paste that there are.
Feb 29 17:15:30 *	short-bike looks at sysinfo 
Feb 29 17:16:22 <Uniaika>	(fun fact, reinstalling `stack` made it work again)
Feb 29 17:16:53 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Perhaps it got an update?  No idea.
Feb 29 17:18:41 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: I tried to update it from its own updater, and it told me I was already at the latest version :/
Feb 29 17:25:05 <ncuxo>	leden: should I have more files there ?
Feb 29 17:26:00 <leden>	ncuxo, can you make  like 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf and cat paste --> https://paste.centos.org/view/51d1d8af
Feb 29 17:26:50 <leden>	ncuxo, save it and reboot system
Feb 29 17:27:05 <akik>	Khaytsus: the idle temperature on this laptop is about 49 C. the critical temperature which was reached was 88 C :P
Feb 29 17:27:49 <akik>	i'll try that air cleaning some day soon
Feb 29 17:38:45 <ncuxo>	leden: I still have the screen tear
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 17:48:27 <ncuxo>	5.5.6 is out so its not up to date
Feb 29 17:54:54 <leden>	ncuxo, can you run 'nvidia-settings' in terminal
Feb 29 17:56:28 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b1d7d1e8
Feb 29 17:56:44 <ncuxo>	leden: I did run it but the nvidia driver is not loaded
Feb 29 17:57:02 <ncuxo>	I guess by default the nouveau driver is loaded
Feb 29 17:57:19 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:19 <ncuxo>	should I blacklist it?
Feb 29 17:57:24 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:29 <kwizart>	leden, NO!
Feb 29 17:57:50 <leden>	kwizart, ol
Feb 29 17:57:50 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you should follow guides: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Feb 29 17:58:05 <ncuxo>	kwizart: this is what I did
Feb 29 17:58:19 <ncuxo>	I started with another guide and leden gave me this one
Feb 29 17:58:32 <ncuxo>	so I reinstalled fedora and used the rpmfusion one
Feb 29 17:58:49 <kwizart>	ncuxo, please verify to have kernel-devel matching your kernel and let it build the nvidia kmod
Feb 29 17:59:24 <kwizart>	ncuxo, if you have nouveau still loaded, please don't manually blacklist it, please reboot a second time eventually
Feb 29 17:59:33 <kwizart>	ncuxo, and verify to have secure boot disabled
Feb 29 18:00:26 <ncuxo>	kwizart: isn't secure boot only on EFI?
Feb 29 18:00:37 <kwizart>	yes, it is
Feb 29 18:00:59 <ncuxo>	kwizart: I just rebooted and still nouveau is loaded
Feb 29 18:01:20 <ncuxo>	the kernel-devel and the kernel are the same version
Feb 29 18:01:23 <kwizart>	ncuxo, then paste the archive created by nvidia-bug-report.sh
Feb 29 18:01:42 <kwizart>	ncuxo, does modinfo nvidia output something ?
Feb 29 18:01:45 <ncuxo>	where is this located ?
Feb 29 18:01:56 <kwizart>	ncuxo, in your PATH
Feb 29 18:02:02 <ncuxo>	yes module nvidia not found
Feb 29 18:02:13 <kwizart>	ncuxo, try with akmods --force
Feb 29 18:03:12 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/0c748833
Feb 29 18:03:21 <ncuxo>	here is the nvidia bug report
Feb 29 18:03:55 <kwizart>	ncuxo, not really, zcat nvidia-bug-report.log.gz |fpaste
Feb 29 18:04:36 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/2a1cc05d
Feb 29 18:06:23 <ncuxo>	this is for akmods --force https://paste.centos.org/view/1ce39375
Feb 29 18:06:28 <ncuxo>	it was unable to build
Feb 29 18:07:58 <kwizart>	ncuxo, why are you using nvidia-390 driver ?
Feb 29 18:08:57 <ncuxo>	because this is what my card needs
Feb 29 18:09:28 <kwizart>	ncuxo, well, indeed, this is the right ones
Feb 29 18:09:32 <ncuxo>	its a legacy GeForce 400 card
Feb 29 18:09:59 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b33e60bd this is the akmods --force logs
Feb 29 18:10:02 <kwizart>	ncuxo, so we end-up having issue with 5.5.x kernel apparently and we are seeking for maintainers
Feb 29 18:10:36 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you might have better luck with the kernel-longterm-5.4 that I'm building
Feb 29 18:10:44 <kwizart>	ncuxo, https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/kernel-longterm-5.4/
Feb 29 18:11:14 <ncuxo>	oh with 5.4 I was fine
Feb 29 18:11:24 <ncuxo>	I was using it before I started to move to 5.5

Feb 29 22:06:24 <janos_>	oh hadn't seen that one. looking

Mar 02 12:40:31 <BlackMage>	is no partition manager in lxde-live included?
Mar 02 12:45:00 <p3lim>	Hey, is there something like du that lets me check disk space per directory, but on a specific disk? du shows directory space usage on all disks
Mar 02 12:46:26 <rru04>	du shows space usage of directories
Mar 02 12:46:50 <BlackMage>	specify the directory as argument
Mar 02 12:47:15 <FranciscoD>	BlackMage: you can install stuff on the live image, including a partition manager.
Mar 02 12:47:30 <FranciscoD>	Otherwise, when you want to install from the live, anaconda includes one
Mar 02 12:47:36 <p3lim>	I have 20 disks in the system, but the sysroot disk  is close to full, need to find out _on that disk_ what's taking up space, but it's showing disk space from _all 20 disks_
Mar 02 12:48:04 <p3lim>	specifying the directory doesn't help
Mar 02 12:48:08 <FranciscoD>	p3lim: `du <path to where whatever disk is mounted>`
Mar 02 12:48:19 <FranciscoD>	are you running it in /?
Mar 02 12:48:25 <p3lim>	yes
Mar 02 12:48:42 <FranciscoD>	`du <path>` works just fine here
Mar 02 12:48:47 <FranciscoD>	that's also what the man page says
Mar 02 12:48:48 <rru04>	p3lim: like that du -sh /usr/local
Mar 02 12:48:54 <FranciscoD>	where is the sysroot mounted?
Mar 02 12:49:01 <p3lim>	on /
Mar 02 12:49:22 <FranciscoD>	so then it's showing you the right output
Mar 02 12:49:33 <FranciscoD>	du does not do disks, it does folders/directories
Mar 02 12:49:50 <FranciscoD>	since all your disks are also mounted in /, it also looks at them
Mar 02 12:50:07 <FranciscoD>	manually specify what directories you want it to look at
Mar 02 12:50:14 <p3lim>	which is why I'm asking for something _like_ du but that takes disks into account
Mar 02 12:50:37 <FranciscoD>	not heard of anything that does that, sorry
Mar 02 12:51:04 <FranciscoD>	either you get disk overviews with df
Mar 02 12:51:11 <FranciscoD>	or you get directory data with du
Mar 02 12:51:34 <FranciscoD>	check their man pages, maybe they have advanced options
Mar 02 12:52:50 <rru04>	well df checks filesystems usage and on which device (disk)
Mar 02 12:54:28 <rru04>	as you know which filesystem is running out of space you will identify which directory contains too much of data
Mar 02 12:57:21 <BlackMage>	ok, after i resized the pv with kparititionmanager the system dont boot
Mar 02 12:57:22 <cberg>	p3lim: du -hcx -d 1 /
Mar 02 12:57:31 <cberg>	-x means don't traverse filesystems
Mar 02 12:58:47 <p3lim>	cberg: thanks!
Mar 02 12:58:49 <cberg>	and to sort it: du -hcx -d 1 / | sort -h
Mar 02 12:58:57 <rru04>	p3lim: find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -I REPL bash -c "du -s 'REPL'" | sort -g
Mar 02 12:59:47 <rru04>	with this command you will find how much data is in every directory and also it will sort them
Mar 02 13:00:38 <damo22>	or just use ncdu
Mar 02 14:55:06 <rexwin>	I donot want graphics in fedora . how to change the default runlevel to 3?
Mar 02 14:56:01 <der_Alte>	you can't because there are no runlevels anymore ... however you can set multi-user.target to be the default systemd target
Mar 02 14:56:10 <Khaytsus>	systemctl set-default multi-user.target
Mar 02 14:56:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	rexwin take a look at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SysVinit_to_Systemd_Cheatsheet

Mar 02 16:09:45 <FixPleaseTo>	I suffer, because Netflix doesn't play.  is somebody helping with this?  the service error code today is M7355. I'm running the l8est fedora with proprietary nvidia drivers to use chromium.  I have rpm fusion free and nonfree enabled
Mar 02 16:11:24 <linuxmodder>	iirc that is flash player related but should be minimal issue if at all on chrom*   it's more pronounced on firefox
Mar 02 16:14:32 <Khaytsus>	Netflix works perfectly fine on Chrome.
Mar 02 16:15:29 <FixPleaseTo>	my heart says go with chromium, buuuut it seems that it's going to be an option that's closed
Mar 02 16:16:00 <FixPleaseTo>	there is some "freeworld" flavor of chromium listed as well, but that only gives a partial functionality (previews play, but an actual show stream won't).  it also knocks the version (of chromium) down 2 numbers, and seemingly introduces a scary red icon on top relating to "sync", which I don't think I'll be using anyway
Mar 02 16:20:02 <karroffel>	Netflix works fine for me on Firefox
Mar 02 16:20:32 <karroffel>	You need to enable the DRM feature, but that was all that I had to do
Mar 02 16:22:24 <janos_>	fine here with firefox. never tried it before. just did, no problem
Mar 02 16:25:58 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, chromium-freeworld (or even fedora chromium) isn't allowed to distribute the DRM components netflix relies on
Mar 02 16:26:04 <storrgie>	I'm wondering if anyone has gone through the dnf update process (between say 30->31) with ZFS on their system (not ZFS root, but having attached ZFS pools)
Mar 02 16:26:16 <storrgie>	I'm thinking of moving from debian to fedora server and this is my one worry
Mar 02 16:26:29 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-chromium-or-google-chrome-browsers/
Mar 02 16:27:07 <FixPleaseTo>	ty lots, it's tgreat having options. thanks! this is bound to set me up now

Mar 18 14:09:57 <ufo>	so i want to uninstall geoclue2, and it looks like webkit2gtk3 depends on it for some reason
Mar 18 14:10:21 <Khaytsus>	Why would you need to remove it?
Mar 18 14:10:36 <ufo>	which looks like is on my system because of "yelp" browser, which i don't use...  but when i try to uninstall that it says anaconda depends on it
Mar 18 14:10:58 <ufo>	i don't want geo stuff at all
Mar 18 14:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	so why did you install the yelp browser
Mar 18 14:11:24 <ufo>	i didn't
Mar 18 14:11:45 <Khaytsus>	yhelp is gnome's help browser.. it's not a 'web' browser
Mar 18 14:11:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes you did yelp.x86_64 : Help browser for the GNOME desktop
Mar 18 14:11:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	ou installed gnome
Mar 18 14:12:02 <ufo>	i'm not sure why it would have been installed by default in the xfce spin
Mar 18 14:12:08 <Khaytsus>	I did not install Gnome; yelp is installed here
Mar 18 14:12:32 <Khaytsus>	I suspect it's bundled into some of the gnome stuff that is in every spin
Mar 18 14:12:55 <Khaytsus>	ufo: Obessing over individual packages is an interesting hobby but unlikely a productive one.
Mar 18 14:13:55 <ufo>	thanks

Mar 18 15:58:39 <Khaytsus>	God I hate matrix.
Mar 18 16:15:28 <Bayesian_Coffee>	having trouble with the internal mic on F31, on a ThinkPad T490. found this bug and comment: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772498#c223
Mar 18 16:15:47 <Bayesian_Coffee>	how do i get this pulseaudio-13.99.1-1.fc31.x86_64 package though?
Mar 18 16:15:56 <Bayesian_Coffee>	when i try to upgrade, i'm not seeing it in any repos i have
Mar 18 16:22:37 <kwizart>	Bayesian_Coffee, dnf update --enablerepo=updates-testing pulseaudio\*
Mar 18 16:24:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	ah, got it. will try that, thanks
Mar 18 16:31:30 <Bayesian_Coffee>	thanks! that worked perfectly
Mar 18 16:32:06 <Bayesian_Coffee>	so, newbie q: given that they closed that bug and filed a new one for F32, what do the update schedules look like for F31 from now on? is stuff not going to get patched in 31?
Mar 18 16:32:37 <Bayesian_Coffee>	like is that newer version of pulseaudio not going go make it into F31 outside of the testing repo?
Mar 18 16:34:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	Bayesian_Coffee, it looks like it is set tonight or tomorrow morning https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=pulseaudio
Mar 18 16:34:23 <Bayesian_Coffee>	oh, cool.
Mar 18 16:34:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	of course right when i start to WFH from COVID-19, to get on a Google Hangout my mic is out...
Mar 18 16:35:11 <Bayesian_Coffee>	but yeah, working perfectly now
Mar 18 16:44:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, https://imagebin.ca/v/5G3PKDX5bVc7
Mar 18 16:54:31 <idlemind>	so something recent has definitely sped up my vp9 encoding, that's a welcome change. went from ~ 24 h for a 480p full length movie to 5 h. nice
Mar 18 16:59:09 <nerdwoman>	Hey everybody, running fedora with xfce on my laptop here. Had to start doing video chatting for work and using hte camera at all uses 200%+ of the cpu, sitting around a load of 8 with 4 cores. I don't suppose there might be better drivers out there, that would help with this?
Mar 18 17:00:04 <nerdwoman>	... I've never troubleshot a webcam before, just audio drivers back in the day
Mar 18 17:02:01 <sbroz>	is it unexpected that realtime video encoding uses a lot of cpu?
Mar 18 17:02:39 <idlemind>	it shouldn't kill the cpu though, how is your performance with something like cheese
Mar 18 17:02:49 <idlemind>	might just be codec related
Mar 18 17:03:18 <idlemind>	(xfce likely won't have cheese, it has a flatpak though if you don't want to pull in a lot of rpms)
Mar 18 17:03:36 <dowdle>	idlemind: If you think that is slow, you should try av1 encoding. :)  It is measured in minutes per frame.
Mar 18 17:04:11 <idlemind>	dowdle ya for me a faster encode is kind of just a nice to have, i don't really have any deadlines. just slowly digitizing dvds
Mar 18 17:04:18 <dowdle>	idlemind: I tried encoding a movie and it was halfway done after about 2.5 weeks. :)
Mar 18 17:04:20 <idlemind>	just impressed in a 24 hr to 5 hr drop
Mar 18 17:04:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	sbroz, no its not unexpected
Mar 18 17:04:54 <sbroz>	Southern_Gentlem: indeed
Mar 18 17:05:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	idlemind, but to me i rather use the cheese in the repos than flatpak
Mar 18 17:06:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	it will definitely makes upgrades down the road easier with the repo packages
Mar 18 17:09:04 <ForlornWongraven>	flatpak is really nice to check something
Mar 18 17:09:13 <ForlornWongraven>	over time repos are much better
Mar 18 17:11:26 <idlemind>	ya, it's also nice from a dev perspective to hit a wide target without a lot of effort

Mar 18 22:40:04 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: since the source code is available I may think of starting packaging it
Mar 18 22:40:12 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see this for EL7 - https://github.com/Rupan/mprime
Mar 18 22:41:51 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: very interesting
Mar 18 22:42:02 <Caterpillar>	I wonder why this guy never putted those specs in fedora repo
Mar 18 22:42:08 <Caterpillar>	and / EPEL
Mar 18 22:43:29 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Well, while the source code is available they have quite a few licensing terms... and a skim of those makes it appear they claim to own all data... so maybe it isn't free software?!?
Mar 18 22:45:30 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: maybe, I had not seen the license yet
Mar 18 22:46:28 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see quite a few web references to use mprime as a system stress test... and every reference I've seen refers to the links provided by the software provider's website and not any packages from distros.
Mar 18 22:47:21 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Doesn't look like Debian packages it.
Mar 18 22:50:14 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: yes, the license page is a bit........wird

Mar 19 10:54:36 <andy|>	anyone else on f32 having problems with sound output and bluetooth headset?
Mar 19 11:31:51 <bern>	hi, I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 11:51:33 <BinaryAura>	I'm trying to install Nvidia drivers but after I disabled nouveau my monitors no longer are receiving input and my motherboard is not giving any signs of error. Any advice?
Mar 19 11:53:33 <kwizart>	BinaryAura, you shoudn't touch any low level driver, but rely on using packaged driver as this is way easier even for advanced users
Mar 19 11:54:11 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: rpmfusion has the nvidia driver packaged for Fedora. You only need to install the packages and that's it, it  takes care of the rest including disabling nouveau.
Mar 19 11:56:27 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:42 <ratskin>	BinaryAura: RPMFusion's HowTo includes instructions for recovering from any mess that might be left by using Nvidia's installer: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:50 <ratskin>	Snap :)
Mar 19 11:56:55 <[Enrico]>	as easy as it can get with Nvidia on Linux
Mar 19 11:57:11 <[Enrico]>	still definitely not as easy as with Intel and AMD
Mar 19 11:57:48 <BinaryAura>	I had two GPU cards installed I switched which one I was using and the monitor came up. This is weird because both cards were working before

Mar 19 14:21:28 <Sheogorath[m]>	oDiafanos: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-apache-http-server/ <-- this should get your through the basics :)
Mar 19 14:30:24 <oDiafanos>	thanks but this site doesnt include vhost multiple site configuration
Mar 19 14:31:52 <Khaytsus>	oDiafanos: #httpd
Mar 19 14:32:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  google does
Mar 19 14:32:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	basicly you can do one you can do many
Mar 19 14:32:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	(Directory) (/Directory)
Mar 19 14:33:23 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: What do you need to know?
Mar 19 14:34:32 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if I make an index file in /var/www/html everything works (no welcome page)
Mar 19 14:35:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Mar 19 14:35:19 <vdamewood>	That's normal.
Mar 19 14:35:24 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if i make a "Second site" in /var/www/html/docs/index with the appropriate "vhost" file
Mar 19 14:35:41 <vdamewood>	What's a "vhost" file?
Mar 19 14:36:08 <oDiafanos>	a conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d
Mar 19 14:38:06 <oDiafanos>	to send my browser request throught a test domain to a specific httpd folder
Mar 19 14:38:06 <vdamewood>	I se an "if", but no follow up "then"
Mar 19 14:38:09 <vdamewood>	s/se/see/
Mar 19 14:39:56 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: ? :P
Mar 19 14:40:36 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, it's rather impossible to figure out what's going on until you complete your thought.
Mar 19 14:41:09 <oDiafanos>	ok so : index file in /www/html folder works normaly
Mar 19 14:42:03 <oDiafanos>	second index in /www/html/docs/index WITH conf file with test domain dont work
Mar 19 14:42:41 <oDiafanos>	in second example welcome page appears in all test domains
Mar 19 14:45:05 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: 1: You should probably put web spaces in different directories, and not have one as a child of the other. 2: What's the name of your conf file with the virtual host information? 3: fpaste your vhost config file.
Mar 19 14:45:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos, <Directory /www/html/test>   </Directory>
Mar 19 14:47:07 <vdamewood>	Oh, I just noticed it's /www and not /var/www. So, yeah <Directory ...>, but also, did you do either of changing the selinux context on the /www directory, or disable selinux?
Mar 19 14:50:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	vdamewood, also depends on their document root statement above that
Mar 19 14:50:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	mine says /srv/www/html
Mar 19 14:51:23 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: it all in  /var/www/html , i just skipped writing /var but its correct in my configuration
Mar 19 14:51:45 <vdamewood>	I think my production system doesn't even have a Document Root outside of a vhost.
Mar 19 14:52:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  so make a subdirectory for each host under that
Mar 19 14:53:59 <oDiafanos>	Southern_Gentlem: i'll try that now + <Directory ...>  + disable se
Mar 19 14:56:03 <vdamewood>	Actually, if you're in /var/www, you won't have to mess with SE. if you want to put your docs somewhere else, it's not hard to change the context.
Mar 19 14:59:22 <oDiafanos>	i'm in /var/www/html/ as httpd.conf uses it for root folder
Mar 19 15:01:15 <oDiafanos>	fedora 31 server , default httpd installation
Mar 19 15:02:44 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, what about 2 and 3 that I mentioned above?
Mar 19 15:05:22 <oDiafanos>	2. docs.conf 3. https://pastebin.com/yQ4JGE11
Mar 19 15:07:39 <oDiafanos>	diferent directories is the solution
Mar 19 15:08:37 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: So, you fixed it?
Mar 19 15:08:39 <oDiafanos>	i just made 3 test sites in subfolders and they work
Mar 19 15:08:42 <oDiafanos>	yes
Mar 19 15:08:55 <oDiafanos>	well... i learned how it works :P
Mar 19 15:09:20 <oDiafanos>	thank you for explaining
Mar 19 15:09:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  like i said if the first one works its easy to cut and paste for the rest

Mar 19 16:18:16 <dbristow>	Southern_Gentlem: So you were right, it is taking a while to finish seeding 32_Beta Labs x86_64
Mar 19 16:19:37 <dbristow>	Astronomy_KDE and Design_suite finished but the rest are mostly 0kB/s
Mar 19 16:26:10 <devid>	why is the weather in my gnome panel showing as the first entry, time 01:00 with value "--" ?
Mar 19 16:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, now that i turn them off they should come up
Mar 19 16:32:04 <Khaytsus>	I've never seeded those, honestly..  just the base spins.  It've send up 16G for KDE, 15G for Mate, 8G for XFCE, 4G for LXDE, 5G for LXQT, 13G for Cinnamon, 40G for Workstation
Mar 19 16:35:16 <dbristow>	Khaytsus: I may do that for 32 actual.
Mar 19 16:35:22 <dbristow>	Normally I don't torrent betas.
Mar 19 16:35:48 <Khaytsus>	I usually seed beta and release
Mar 19 17:01:56 <linux_user>	Subscription-manager is a paid service no? Why is Fedora telling me I need to pay for it to have updates?
Mar 19 17:02:13 <linux_user>	or why is Fedora saying I need to use subscription manager?
Mar 19 17:02:35 <sbroz>	linux_user: where? are you sure you're actually on fedora?
Mar 19 17:02:59 <Sheogorath[m]>	linux_user: Where does it say this?
Mar 19 17:03:03 <linux_user>	[root@fedoravm1 stuart]# cat /etc/redhat-release

Mar 19 17:03:45 <Venemo>	hey guys. does RPM Fusion work with Fedora 32 yet?
Mar 19 17:04:17 *	fedbot removes quiet on *!*@71.38.204.217
Mar 19 17:04:47 <linux_user>	https://pastebin.com/YBVs50xV
Mar 19 17:05:39 <Khaytsus>	Venemo: rpmfusion is not typically something that you use when testing Fedora.
Mar 19 17:05:52 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: You installed that, so..
Mar 19 17:06:05 <linux_user>	huh? I never install subscription-manager!
Mar 19 17:06:07 <linux_user>	that is a lie
Mar 19 17:06:54 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 17:08:10 <Venemo>	Khaytsus: I respectfully disagree, it usually is. AFAIK usually rpmfusion rawhide is usable on the latest fedora beta, at least that's my past experience
Mar 19 17:08:18 <linux_user>	https://paste.centos.org/view/086e9515
Mar 19 17:09:41 <linux_user>	https://paste.centos.org/view/de4c68d8
Mar 19 17:10:39 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: Perhaps you use Cockpit?  Apparently it's easily enabled from there, leading to this.  Fedora does not install that package by default.
Mar 19 17:11:36 <linux_user>	I do use Cockpit yet
Mar 19 17:11:44 <linux_user>	all I did was do a system update with it.
Mar 19 17:11:49 <linux_user>	let me look at cockpit
Mar 19 17:11:55 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps you enabled the subscription stuff from there.  Anyway, just remove suscription-manager
Mar 19 17:13:50 <linux_user>	hmm....ok, I see that in Applications now! very odd, as I don't remember doing that - however, I did remove it and am rebooting
Mar 19 17:14:07 <linux_user>	I know subscription-manager is for paid support, so I would not know why I'd have ever enabled it!
Mar 19 17:14:31 <Khaytsus>	nor do we
Mar 19 17:15:21 <linux_user>	I will surely need to be more careful about noticing if that is enabled on Fedora systems I work with in the future as well.
Mar 19 17:15:34 <Khaytsus>	It will not be unless you do it.
Mar 19 17:21:27 <linux_user>	I also un-installed subscription-manager
Mar 19 17:22:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	subscription manager got added to fedora for some reason back in f30 iirc
Mar 19 17:23:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	live would not build without it for some reason which was later fixed
Mar 19 17:34:03 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: He's making claims that it installed itself, however, which is not true.  the package itself as part of Fedora, not sure
Mar 19 17:44:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so if he installed f30 then dnf upgraded it would still be on his machine
Mar 19 18:05:30 <bern>	apologies for reposting, but I've not been able to find an answer to this online.
Mar 19 18:05:39 <bern>	I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 18:09:45 <moowhool>	Hello everyone. Is it the right place to suggest changes to the `dnf` package manager ?
Mar 19 18:12:35 <FranciscoD>	moowhool: #yum, github, their mailing list
Mar 19 18:13:18 <moowhool>	FrancsisoD: Thank you very much
Mar 19 18:22:15 <plundra>	bern: /etc/crypto-policies/config
Mar 19 18:22:40 <plundra>	bern: Read the man-page of update-crypto-policies
Mar 19 18:24:56 <cberg>	the 'verfiy' link on https://alt.fedoraproject.org/ for the netinstall (aka everything) doesn't work (404)
Mar 19 18:27:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg which netinstall
Mar 19 18:27:59 <bern>	plundra: thanks, looks like it's actually /etc/crypto-policies/local.d, but your pointer helped me find that
Mar 19 18:28:04 <cberg>	Southern_Gentlem: the one on that page under "Everything" (I suppose that's the official name for the netinst now)
Mar 19 18:28:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg, not all mirrors carry the beta
Mar 19 18:28:22 <cberg>	that's still F31
Mar 19 18:28:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	give me the full link
Mar 19 18:28:35 <cberg>	https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Everything/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Everything-netinst-x86_64-31-1.9.iso

Mar 19 18:31:15 <Acru>	Hey, I am currently having a problem with Fedora 31 on a Lenovo W520, up until yesterday my integrated webcam worked without problems, but when trying to use it again today, it does not work at all, so it does not seem to transmit any pictures (e.g. chees is just black and the buttons are greyed out)
Mar 19 18:31:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	try http://mirror.cc.vt.edu/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Everything/x86_64/iso/
Mar 19 18:31:47 <cberg>	that does have the Checksum file, thanks Southern_Gentlem
Mar 19 18:31:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, so what changed from yesterday to today
Mar 19 18:31:59 <Acru>	I did some updates
Mar 19 18:32:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so what have tested
Mar 19 18:32:26 <Acru>	Sorry?
Mar 19 18:32:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	you did some updates so that must of caused the issue
Mar 19 18:33:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	what have you tested out of those updates
Mar 19 18:33:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 18:34:17 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/56ce6034
Mar 19 18:34:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg,  and there are the updated isos in the topic (and the Respins Sig is testing a new batch at the moment
Mar 19 18:35:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru,  first thing i would try would be booting into your older kernel
Mar 19 18:35:54 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem I already tried that, but it did not fix the isue
Mar 19 18:38:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru dnf history |fpaste
Mar 19 18:38:46 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/501a04f9
Mar 19 18:39:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	start looking at dnf history info 344 and work yourway back to the top
Mar 19 18:41:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	also i disagree with ever using the -y switch you need to see where stuff is being installed from
Mar 19 18:41:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	especially when you have so many third party repos
Mar 19 18:42:58 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem any further info what that might mean? `Failed to try-restart pesign.service: Unit pesign.service not found.`
Mar 19 18:44:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	not out the top of my head
Mar 19 18:44:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	so look through your journalctl and see if you see anymore errors

Mar 20 10:23:42 <tete_>	hi, i am facing a problem with my soundcard (creative soundblaster xae-5 or so...). the profile which is used as default in pavu control is wrong. everytime i reboot my machine, it is set to digital input/output, but that is wrong, it is analog surround 5.1 + analog stereo input. can someone tell me how to fix that?
Mar 20 10:23:52 <tete_>	its so annoying
Mar 20 11:30:07 <daniel-wtd>	Hi all, I am having a monitor connected via usb-c. It also provides a usb hub, which connects stuff like keyboard, mouse. The issue ist, that everytime the notebook goes to "blank screen", the whole monitor is disconnected and therefore all peripherals, too. Do you see any option (aside disabling screen lock) to address this?

Mar 20 15:50:21 <corshmock>	Hi all
Mar 20 15:51:00 <corshmock>	I'm trying to install OneDrive from this link but getting error.  https://fedora.pkgs.org/31/fedora-updates-x86_64/onedrive-2.3.12-1.fc31.x86_64.rpm.html
Mar 20 15:51:23 <corshmock>	Has anyone successfully install OneDrive on Fedora Workstation 31?  Newbie here
Mar 20 15:51:32 <kwizart>	corshmock, why not use it from the repository; dnf install onedrive
Mar 20 15:52:12 <corshmock>	kwizart: that's exactly what I did, but I got an error (can post pastebin) but it doesn't appear to have installed.
Mar 20 15:53:07 <kwizart>	corshmock,  sudo dnf install onedrive | paste
Mar 20 15:54:55 <corshmock>	I'll try that thank kwizart
Mar 20 15:57:01 <corshmock>	https://paste.centos.org/view/f37e830c
Mar 20 15:57:18 <corshmock>	It asks for a response url ??
Mar 20 16:03:29 <kwizart>	corshmock, it's already installed. now I cannot help with using onedrive, I guess you need to use it from an associated account in the desktop environnement
Mar 20 16:04:01 <kwizart>	corshmock, in gnome, there is the oneline account application that might help to configure the microsoft account to be used with onedrive and others applications...
Mar 20 16:06:27 <corshmock>	oneline kwizart ?  Can't find any such thing.  I'm logged into onedrive in firefox but when I paste that url in, it says Could not initialize the OneDrive API
Mar 20 16:08:56 <Khaytsus>	https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive  has usage info
Mar 20 16:13:51 <launchpadmcquak>	does anybody know how to reference a local path (not http) repo properly in mock?  mock in fedora 31 appears to ignore file:/// repos outright
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	was lead to here in my googling: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki/Plugin-BindMount
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	but I'm not sure what the destination mountpoint should be such that dnf will see it and pull the repodata from it... anybody else stumped by this?
Mar 20 16:15:05 *	mock never ignores files or repos
Mar 20 16:15:33 <Egyptian>	hi - so .. due to work load - i upgraded my work laptop's bios about 10 days ago and finally rebooted today. and now the "windows-like" screen says my disk is corrupt. how do i tell uefi to use the linux partition instead ? and i do not have windows on this machine. this must be the "repair" partition or something
Mar 20 16:15:37 <launchpadmcquak>	seems like it does in recent versions: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki#using-file-urls-in-configs
Mar 20 16:16:25 <launchpadmcquak>	Egyptian: check your boot order, sometimes after a BIOS update UEFI will throw "Windows Boot Manager" back to the top of the list
Mar 20 16:16:42 <corshmock>	kwizart: I think it's working
Mar 20 16:17:12 <launchpadmcquak>	if this is the wrong room for this mock problem, would someone point me to the right room?
Mar 20 16:17:14 <corshmock>	I entered onedrive --monitor and it started downloading everything from my OneDrive.  Thanks very much for you r help
Mar 20 16:19:05 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You are in the right channel. I cannot answer your question. But file:// is the protocol. file:/// indicates root directory.
Mar 20 16:21:34 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./ to be generic about it, or file://, or completely specific with file:///home/mock/. I'm not sure if this is any help, but I'm taking a shot in the dark.
Mar 20 16:22:13 <launchpadmcquak>	wait, you're saying i've been beating my head against a wall over a potential *extra* slash???
Mar 20 16:22:22 <mock>	Maybe
Mar 20 16:23:36 <Khaytsus>	that's alwys tripped me up before too, but pretty sure the URI is file:// so if you want to browse / it would be file:///
Mar 20 16:23:39 <Khaytsus>	but not sure
Mar 20 16:24:02 <mock>	I think we all have run across this at some point.
Mar 20 16:24:08 <launchpadmcquak>	hmmm, still not happy with the double slash: "Curl error (3): URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL for file://nfs/mock/repos/slurm/31/x86_64/repodata/repomd.xml"
Mar 20 16:24:39 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: Is nfs/mock relative or absolute from root?
Mar 20 16:24:52 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./nfs/mock/...
Mar 20 16:25:02 <launchpadmcquak>	the "file:///" approach works just fine in centos 7, no dice in fedora 31 it seems, was working in previous fedoras
Mar 20 16:25:13 <launchpadmcquak>	okay, trying that
Mar 20 16:25:27 <mock>	The configuration is the same for both OSes?
Mar 20 16:29:04 <Khaytsus>	If the absolute path is /nfs I think file:///nfs is correct
Mar 20 16:29:11 <launchpadmcquak>	pretty sure... <frantically trying to figure out how to use pastebin>
Mar 20 16:29:50 <FranciscoD>	launchpadmcquak: pipe command output to fpaste, or give it a file
Mar 20 16:29:55 <FranciscoD>	or copy paste to paste.fp.o
Mar 20 16:30:39 <mock>	Also can you specify the version numbers of the CentOS install and the Fedora 31 install?
Mar 20 16:31:45 <launchpadmcquak>	centos mock: https://pastebin.com/7gX4suCF
