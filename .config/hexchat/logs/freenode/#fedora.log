Jul 11 10:14:05 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 12:59:14 <Legitkrillin>	hi all!
Jul 11 12:59:41 <Legitkrillin>	I am properly going to get abused but I need to ask something
Jul 11 13:00:34 <Legitkrillin>	I am a massive fan of Fedora and I have been using it for a very long time I simply love it, I have it on all my systems except one!
Jul 11 13:01:22 <dansimon>	Hi guys, I'm trying to customize my wm startup slightly (adding a xsetroot line), but which conf file should I use... not ~/.xinitrc since im running gdm, no luck hacking /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients... any ideas?
Jul 11 13:01:42 <Legitkrillin>	I was reading something that eventually fedora will be what Silverblue is today
Jul 11 13:01:46 <Legitkrillin>	is that true ?
Jul 11 13:02:11 <Legitkrillin>	is everything going to be containerized ?
Jul 11 13:14:46 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: it depends on how the project keeps proceeding.
Jul 11 13:15:10 <FranciscoD>	At the moment, I don't see the workstation product being replaced by silverblue anytime soon
Jul 11 13:15:29 <Legitkrillin>	but its going that way ?
Jul 11 13:15:44 <FranciscoD>	Lots of things don't need containers, so I expect rpms/dnf will remain
Jul 11 13:16:05 <FranciscoD>	Legitkrillin: hard to say, no formal plans, but may happen in the future if the community decides its better tech etc.
Jul 11 13:16:41 <Legitkrillin>	fair enough
Jul 11 13:16:53 <Legitkrillin>	thank you for the info
Jul 11 13:17:16 <Legitkrillin>	for me f30is the best I have ever used
Jul 11 13:19:10 <Legitkrillin>	ok well thanks a million I hope you all have a good day! ^_^

Jul 11 14:20:11 <coz_>	good morning
Jul 11 14:20:34 <saml>	hi coz_ asl?
Jul 11 14:21:55 <mikeymop>	lol
Jul 11 14:23:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	saml, i am hoping that was a joke
Jul 11 14:23:44 *	mikeymop waits for him to has you the same question
Jul 11 14:24:38 <saml>	what do you use for multitrack audio recording?  recording more than stereo channels
Jul 11 14:26:11 <coz_>	saml,  have you tried ardour?
Jul 11 14:27:19 <coz_>	saml, not sure that's what you want, I hate to say this, but when I was composing, it was on **windows
Jul 11 14:27:23 *	coz_ ducks
Jul 11 14:34:16 <saml>	ardour is much bloated. looks like audacity can do as long as hardware supports
Jul 11 14:35:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	for some reason rosegarden pops into my head
Jul 11 14:36:05 <coz_>	I tried that once, I believe it is a notation app
Jul 11 14:36:16 <coz_>	not positive
Jul 11 14:37:41 <FranciscoD>	Not sure if this is up to date, but worth a check: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Jam_Audio_Spin
Jul 11 14:37:59 <coz_>	saml, you can also look here   https://www.slant.co/topics/6067/~daws-for-linux
Jul 11 14:41:11 <coz_>	saml,  out of curiosity, what type of things are you recording?
Jul 11 14:46:05 <saml>	coz_, i was wondering if I can record stereo keyboard along with vocal mic
Jul 11 14:46:18 <saml>	so, 3 channels
Jul 11 14:47:45 <coz_>	saml,  mm ok, I hate to say this, but on windows I used ntrack studio for such things, on linux, I found ardour to be a bit less user freindly, and I doubt ntrack will work in wine
Jul 11 14:49:06 <coz_>	saml, but i used a roland xv88 for all recordings
Jul 11 14:50:19 <coz_>	sam here are some very old pieces I did   https://soundcloud.com/cozziemoto
Jul 11 14:52:49 <ctOS>	Hi. My screen doesn’t turn off properly, despite having enabled energy saving options. It turns off when configured to and then turns back on again. Any ideas on how to troubleshoot? journald log says nothing. dmesg says nothing. [kde plasma 5.15.5, fedora30]
Jul 11 15:01:13 <rdieter>	ctOS: ~/.xsession-errors may have something
Jul 11 15:03:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: i've got that file but it's 0 bytes
Jul 11 15:04:12 <rdieter>	guessing you're not using sddm then
Jul 11 15:04:38 <ctOS>	rdieter: systemctl confirms that it's running
Jul 11 15:04:39 <rdieter>	gdm?  then ~/.local/share/ somewhere I think
Jul 11 15:05:02 <rdieter>	strange, I've never had an empty .xsession-errors with sddm.  <shrug>
Jul 11 15:05:21 <ctOS>	gdm is installed but not running. I originally had the issue with gdm, and switched to sddm to see if it would work. Same issue.
Jul 11 15:05:51 <ctOS>	rdieter: I deleted the file now and I'm restarting to see if it will be populated on reboot.
Jul 11 15:05:52 <rdieter>	ok, dm has nothing to do with it.
Jul 11 15:06:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I have the same issue in grub too. It's supposed to turn off the screen after 5 min. It turns off and then back on again. Tried using different cables but that didn't help.
Jul 11 15:07:01 <ctOS>	The monitor works as expected with other computers.
Jul 11 15:07:20 <ctOS>	Tried running the Ubuntu live CD but ran into the same issue.
Jul 11 15:07:22 <rdieter>	ctOS: does this work?  xset dpms force off
Jul 11 15:07:28 <rdieter>	that should turn the screen off
Jul 11 15:07:29 <ctOS>	Yes
Jul 11 15:07:42 <rdieter>	and it stays off as expected?
Jul 11 15:07:43 <ctOS>	It turns off for like a minute and then turns back on again.
Jul 11 15:08:10 <rdieter>	ah, then I suspect you may have an application that's waking things up, some active notification perhaps
Jul 11 15:08:14 <ctOS>	I've tried disabling screen locking. With screen locking enabled in KDE settings it doesn't ever power off.
Jul 11 15:08:52 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked the inactivity timer, and it keeps incrementing as expected. Not being reset when the screen turns back on.
Jul 11 15:09:09 <ctOS>	rdieter: issue also happens when I don't login and just wait on the login screen.
Jul 11 15:09:14 <rdieter>	in system settings, find the power/battery applet
Jul 11 15:09:28 <ctOS>	(I've spent a lot of fruitless time debugging this.) :P
Jul 11 15:09:29 <rdieter>	and click on it, it should show if there's any application supressing power management
Jul 11 15:10:05 <rdieter>	or if any app in panel is blinking
Jul 11 15:10:26 <rdieter>	that's 2 scenarios that could do what you describe
Jul 11 15:10:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I've checked it. It has a check box for turning power savings on and off, and lists VLC when I use it. But I don't normally ruin that and it's not in the list unless when it's expected to be there.
Jul 11 15:10:50 <ctOS>	*normally run that
Jul 11 15:10:59 <rdieter>	vlc will supress power management when playing media, fyi
Jul 11 15:11:15 <rdieter>	(and sometimes even when not playing, quirky bug)
Jul 11 15:11:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: yeah, that's not the issue. I only mentioned it to demonstrate I've seen how the pallet is supposed to work.
Jul 11 15:11:34 <rdieter>	many media players support that these days
Jul 11 15:12:06 <rdieter>	ok, then I'm out of ideas.  that even with xset things don't stay off implies *something* is waking it up
Jul 11 15:12:14 <ctOS>	rdieter: thanks for your many troubleshooting suggestions!
Jul 11 15:12:33 <ctOS>	rdieter: I know the screen locking thing wakes it up from observations.
Jul 11 15:13:01 <ctOS>	However, I've not found a log anywhere that says *what's* keep waking it. :-/
Jul 11 15:21:26 <sonik_>	trying another crack at getting my P52 to sleep when I close the lid.  I've looked at logind and confirmed that the lid close event is being generated
Jul 11 15:27:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	ctOS, is this a laptop or desktop
Jul 11 15:28:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, and powertop?
Jul 11 15:29:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, most of the time the issue in not going to sleep but waking up afterwards
Jul 11 15:30:23 <sonik_>	lenovo P52
Jul 11 15:31:45 <sonik_>	if i run `systemctl suspend` works...
Jul 11 15:32:07 <sonik_>	hardware key FN+sleep it works
Jul 11 15:36:55 <sonik_>	Southern_Gentlem, what am I looking for with powertop?  the lid event?
Jul 11 15:42:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	sonik_, to see it sees anything that is preventing the sleep

Jul 11 19:35:23 <dvheumen>	hi, I am wondering if there is a way to verify installed package for corruptions. I am aware of 'rpm -Va' but it gives results that are hard to interpret. Any other options?
Jul 11 19:37:34 <webdragon>	package nemo-font-manager-0.7.2-4.fc24.noarch requires nemo-python, but none of the providers can be installed  https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/ddU1vwJRcclu-zoItICUdg  Known issue?
Jul 11 19:48:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, f24?
Jul 11 19:49:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon,  file a bugzilla (yes it is in the f30 repos)
Jul 11 19:49:58 <chrisawi>	the src package is font-manager, it looks like has been failing to build since then
Jul 11 19:50:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suspect it will be going away if someone doesnt port it to py3
Jul 11 19:55:32 <webdragon>	Fedora 29, Southern_Gentlem
Jul 11 20:16:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	webdragon, but that package is f24
Jul 11 20:22:12 <dvheumen>	anyone knows a better way than 'rpm -Va' to verify packages for consistency, corruption, etc.?
Jul 11 20:27:23 <tmz>	dvheumen: That depends on what you don't like about rpm -Va and/or what you're trying to do.
Jul 11 20:28:14 <tmz>	You could use the python rpm bindings if you wanted to adjust the output, as one example.
Jul 11 20:29:49 <dvheumen>	tmz: my issue is specifically with the type of output. It lists the facts of what is changed, timestamps, checksums etc. But from the information I cannot determine whether this is good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:02 <dvheumen>	like, config files may change without it being an issue
Jul 11 20:30:15 <Khaytsus>	Changed is changed.  It's up to you to determine good or bad.
Jul 11 20:30:16 <dvheumen>	but binary files you'd expect to be 100% original
Jul 11 20:30:18 <Khaytsus>	It's not an IDS.
Jul 11 20:30:47 <dvheumen>	okay, so there is no tool that takes a bit more of an informed approach to determine if changes are good or bad?
Jul 11 20:31:20 <dvheumen>	I was hoping for something that would indicate: hmm... these files are corrupted, consider reinstalling this package to ensure correct operation. (For example)
Jul 11 20:31:32 <Khaytsus>	No, how would it know if it's "corrupted"
Jul 11 20:31:53 <dvheumen>	checksum mismatch for binary files?
Jul 11 20:32:00 <dvheumen>	or file missing
Jul 11 20:32:54 <dvheumen>	(it may not cover 100% of package)
Jul 11 20:32:59 <Khaytsus>	It tells you if it's a config, etc....
Jul 11 20:33:14 <dvheumen>	hmmm ...
Jul 11 20:33:35 <dvheumen>	maybe there are some reasonable automated conclusions when parsing the 'rpm -Va' result
Jul 11 20:33:55 <Khaytsus>	You should not have a million rusults in rpm -Va
Jul 11 20:34:15 <Khaytsus>	It's not hard.  What are you actually trying to do, do intruction detection?  If so, rpm -Va is not what you want.
Jul 11 20:35:35 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: intrusion detection would be nice, but very difficult to do on the pc itself. (you'd need an independent, reliable source)
Jul 11 20:36:05 <Khaytsus>	An IDS will track all files, not just files managed by an RPM.  And if the file changes, it can warn.
Jul 11 20:36:09 <dvheumen>	but in case of corrupted files, i.e. disk failing, bad power cut-offs, etc
Jul 11 20:36:24 <Khaytsus>	rpm -Va is not appropriate for any of that.
Jul 11 20:36:41 <dvheumen>	okay, what would you suggest to discover corruption due to issues in hardware/software?
Jul 11 20:36:48 <dvheumen>	... hardware/power/etc.
Jul 11 20:36:48 <Khaytsus>	Is that a real problem??
Jul 11 20:37:27 <dvheumen>	I have had my doubts due to vague kernel messages that aren't conclusively saying "this shit is bad", but it does list a "Corrupted" error that is "recovered"
Jul 11 20:37:40 <Khaytsus>	So you have broken hardware
Jul 11 20:37:50 <Khaytsus>	Could you please just start with the problem, not XY
Jul 11 20:37:51 *	Khaytsus points to http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341 and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem
Jul 11 20:38:20 <Khaytsus>	If you ahve broken hardware, fix it.  Run filesystem checks.  then rpm -Va is useful.
Jul 11 20:38:40 <Khaytsus>	But only for RPM-managed files.  And how do you know if a config file is modified, or corrupt.  You don't.  There's no way to tell
Jul 11 20:39:30 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: I asked about 'rpm -Va' to explore my options. For my specific problem: "pcieport ....: PCIe Bus Error: severity=Corrected, type=Data Link Layer, ..."
Jul 11 20:39:54 <dvheumen>	but then there are a lot of those, and it is hard to check if there are consequences to this
Jul 11 20:40:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, sounds like you need to test the memory and the har drive
Jul 11 20:40:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	hard
Jul 11 20:40:44 <dvheumen>	true, but I haven't found any conclusive evidence that something is wrong
Jul 11 20:41:00 <dvheumen>	I am worried a bit about silent corruptions
Jul 11 20:41:11 <dvheumen>	that's where I figured the checksums of rpm packages may come in handy
Jul 11 20:41:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	if the hardware is faulty how can you trust the software reports from it
Jul 11 20:43:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	the software is telling you something is wrong with the hardware
Jul 11 20:45:04 <dvheumen>	well, the thing is, those messages are more common than you'd think. Apparently it is not necessarily bad. And if this is true, you can at least detect if data is written incorrectly to a persistent store after reading it back
Jul 11 20:47:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dvheumen, we are not here to argue with you, test your hardware and come back then we can go from there, (have results that we can look at )

Jul 11 21:19:00 <dvheumen>	Southern_Gentlem: anywhere I can find info on what has changed in the respins? I see the kernel only mentioned in the README, but I suspect there've been more changes
Jul 11 21:24:57 <Khaytsus>	dvheumen: any package updates since gold was made..
Jul 11 21:27:57 <dvheumen>	Khaytsus: ow wow, so you follow all the updates. Thanks. I did not expect that much change :-P
Jul 11 21:40:58 <ePirat>	Hi
Jul 11 21:41:02 <ePirat>	Are there some packaging guidelines for stuff that uses GNUStep?
Jul 11 21:41:18 <ePirat>	I could only find https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/GNUstep which has no definitive info whatsoever
Jul 11 21:43:51 <sdgathman>	Is there a way to update Fedora with no IP4 connectivity?
Jul 11 21:44:42 <sdgathman>	Eh, some of the mirrors do have IPv6 - I don't know why it can't look them up...
Jul 11 21:52:39 <sdgathman>	ISP nameservers won't return IPv6 results...
Jul 11 21:52:59 <sdgathman>	Had to use my own recursive resolver over darknet
Jul 11 21:53:37 <sdgathman>	You may ask, "Huh?  IPv6 only?  Nameserver won't do IPv6?"
Jul 11 21:54:13 <sdgathman>	They charge a euro/month for each IP4, IP6 is free.  Simple profit motive.
Jul 11 21:57:06 <jidar>	what's wild to me is they don't have a IPv4 to IPv6 tunnel/proxy/whatever its called
Jul 11 21:57:31 <jidar>	my isp gives me a IPv6 but I can hit IPv4 sites all day
Jul 11 22:12:38 <Khaytsus>	Because $sdgathman
Jul 11 23:30:14 <mozzarella>	anyone familiar with libreoffice writer?
Jul 11 23:31:42 <coz_>	mozzarella,  I rarely use it and sometimes actually uninstall it, but is there an issue?

Jul 11 23:37:00 <chrisawi>	but a word processor doesn't really have discrete pages

Jul 12 08:07:22 <latenite>	Hi folks, I have installed a minimal fedora server and now I want it to have X. So I installed i3 (a tiling WM). After running 'startx' I get: "xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1193 does not exist"
Jul 12 08:08:17 <latenite>	after that and 4 longer waiting periods with: "xauth: timeout in locking file /Xauthority"
Jul 12 08:08:30 <latenite>	I get a blac screen...no Desktop no mouse no TTY
Jul 12 08:08:37 <latenite>	What am I missing here?
Jul 12 08:23:27 <grift>	probably xauth latenite
Jul 12 08:23:50 <grift>	xorh-x11-xauth
Jul 12 08:24:31 <grift>	actually i suppose yuo do have it
Jul 12 08:25:48 <grift>	you probably should start it like: startx /usr/bin/i3 (unlesss you have a .xinitrc file)
Jul 12 08:29:26 <latenite>	grift, I have xauth installed
Jul 12 08:29:52 <grift>	did you try `startx /usr/bin/i3`?
Jul 12 08:30:17 <latenite>	and I have .xinitrc with 'exec i3 -c /home/jd/.i3/config'
Jul 12 08:30:34 <latenite>	grift, no let me try that...
Jul 12 08:31:01 <grift>	well if you have an .xinitrc then it shoul work without /usr/bin/i3 , but try it anyway
Jul 12 08:31:28 <latenite>	it sais: xauth: file /home/jd/.serverauth.1518 does not exist
Jul 12 08:31:54 <latenite>	and then timesout with : xauth timeout in locking authority file ?Xauthority
Jul 12 08:32:15 <latenite>	4 long times (*like 10 sec)
Jul 12 08:32:33 <latenite>	then I see a few X messages and get a totally black screen
Jul 12 08:32:40 <latenite>	no mouse no login nothing
Jul 12 08:33:07 <grift>	strange ... i use startx all the time with awesomewm and it works fine here so its not broken
Jul 12 08:33:22 <latenite>	I can do 'killall Xorg" from another tty and see that X terminated
Jul 12 08:33:40 <grift>	it should create the .serverauth file
Jul 12 08:33:47 <grift>	xauth
Jul 12 08:35:34 <grift>	you have these installed?:
Jul 12 08:36:09 <grift>	-driver -xinit -xauth -server-Xorg
Jul 12 08:37:02 <grift>	-drivers*
Jul 12 08:37:54 <grift>	but seems to me that theres a problem with xauth other than that i am not sure
Jul 12 08:38:22 <latenite>	I checked and I was missing -drivers*
Jul 12 08:38:26 <latenite>	I have them now
Jul 12 08:38:53 <latenite>	the problem remains though
Jul 12 08:39:27 <grift>	are there any .serverauth files in /home/jd lingering?
Jul 12 08:40:39 <latenite>	no none
Jul 12 08:40:41 <grift>	i ran out of clues though, this should just work: `startx /usr/bin/i3`

Jul 12 11:55:03 <gidna>	now I get Error: Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'fedora'
Jul 12 12:00:45 <gidna>	this fedora 30 is buggy
Jul 12 12:02:41 <slidercrank>	gidna, try again. I get this error sometimes. But trying again fixes it
Jul 12 12:03:34 <gidna>	the other method is switch-off /on
Jul 12 12:04:22 <alexcleac>	gidna: are you sure you don't have connectivity issues if it still doesn't work after retry?
Jul 12 12:06:45 <_val_>	maybe dnf clean cache or all ?
Jul 12 12:07:10 <gidna>	I'll try later maybe there's some congestion
Jul 12 12:08:36 <FranciscoD>	that's shouldn't be an OS issue, probably a networking one
Jul 12 12:08:42 <FranciscoD>	either a bad mirror or just bad connectivity
Jul 12 12:08:57 <FranciscoD>	switching on and off should not really have an effect on that one either
Jul 12 12:09:52 <alexcleac>	It may help though. If the networking issue was caused by dns cache or whatever related to local level
Jul 12 12:10:26 <alexcleac>	But there are always ways to find out debug those issues without switching on and off :)
Jul 12 12:12:14 <hortiel>	I'd like to know about more such /sys/ or other files if any? how would I get a list of them?
Jul 12 12:12:27 <hortiel>	monitor changing and controlling hooks
Jul 12 12:13:13 <hortiel>	any people's who know how to change the pixels?
Jul 12 12:13:35 <hortiel>	for example I'd like to control the gpu to output certain pixels to monitors
Jul 12 12:16:50 <slidercrank>	hortiel, how do you want to achieve that?
Jul 12 12:18:45 <hortiel>	slidercrank: via some files
Jul 12 12:18:50 <janos_>	..
Jul 12 12:18:51 <hortiel>	what are my options
Jul 12 12:19:19 <hortiel>	for example if I don't know that a backlight file at  a location exist, how'd i know about those?
Jul 12 12:19:29 <slidercrank>	if you want to control certain pixels, you should do it in the kernel driver, I think. You cannot access pixels directly otherwise. Well, you could use SVGAlib to have a low-level access to the video memory. Or have a full control in MS-DOS
Jul 12 12:19:29 <hortiel>	i'd like to employ a similar search functionality
Jul 12 12:20:27 <hortiel>	how to do it in driver
Jul 12 12:20:48 <slidercrank>	write your own driver
Jul 12 12:21:17 <hortiel>	but I can easily access the bit in disk without writing a driver because it's already provided... I am sure others have already built the drivers
Jul 12 12:22:01 <hortiel>	you don't write your own driver, if I wrote the driver I provide it to the whole world, and linux already has development done on top of that... just need the hooks
Jul 12 12:23:14 <slidercrank>	I have doubt that is applicable to modern GPUs. That would be epicaly slow.
Jul 12 12:23:16 <hortiel>	/dev/sda already gives low level control..
Jul 12 12:23:29 <hortiel>	so I doubt it there are none in the kernel
Jul 12 12:24:04 <hortiel>	Is there a channel where I can meet kernel devs or linux kernel channel?
Jul 12 12:24:13 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:24:39 <slidercrank>	but where do you want to control individual pixels? Under X?
Jul 12 12:25:32 <hortiel>	so that I can get some low level control similar to device files!!
Jul 12 12:25:46 <slidercrank>	:)
Jul 12 12:25:49 <hortiel>	yes slidercrank
Jul 12 12:26:00 <slidercrank>	that is not going to happen
Jul 12 12:26:31 <hortiel>	:(
Jul 12 12:26:41 <slidercrank>	but the channel is #kernel
Jul 12 12:27:24 <hortiel>	can I mail linux devs?
Jul 12 12:27:41 <hortiel>	I'd like to ask if they've already known something similar.
Jul 12 12:27:44 <slidercrank>	yes, but I am afraid they will laugh at the request
Jul 12 12:27:48 <alexcleac>	I think there is a way to control every pixel on kernel level, otherwise, the X11, Mir and Wayland wouldn't be possible
Jul 12 12:27:59 <slidercrank>	And there are hundreds emails a day
Jul 12 12:28:29 <slidercrank>	hortiel, lkml
Jul 12 12:28:34 <slidercrank>	linux kernel maillist
Jul 12 12:29:31 <slidercrank>	it feels like you are doing something the wrong way
Jul 12 12:29:49 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I find nothing funny about it. I wish you could take me seriously. before writing my own kernel code- I'd first like to figure out it's components low -level ones, and use them first.
Jul 12 12:30:12 <hortiel>	slidercrank: I do manipulate individual bits, using /dev/sda ... what's wrong? are you kidding me?
Jul 12 12:30:22 <slidercrank>	maybe study the graphics stack first? Writing a driver isn't an easy thing
Jul 12 12:30:22 <hortiel>	I'd do low level access for education use.
Jul 12 12:30:45 <slidercrank>	hortiel, then MS-DOS would be the best choice! Full control of everything!
Jul 12 12:30:54 <hortiel>	slidercrank: wtf
Jul 12 12:31:16 <slidercrank>	nothing impedes your games with hardware.
Jul 12 12:31:31 <slidercrank>	direct access to every register.
Jul 12 12:31:44 <hortiel>	in ms-dos?
Jul 12 12:31:49 <slidercrank>	yes
Jul 12 12:32:03 <alexcleac>	I think in FreeDOS you can have this too :)
Jul 12 12:32:03 <slidercrank>	or freedos (which is basically the same)
Jul 12 12:32:29 <hortiel>	hmm, interesting, which cmd ? do I have to run ms-dos on top of linux or baremetal?
Jul 12 12:32:54 <slidercrank>	no, not under any OS. Load it directly
Jul 12 12:33:16 <slidercrank>	or better use a Virtual Machine
Jul 12 12:33:35 <slidercrank>	hardware is well-emulated
Jul 12 12:34:14 <hortiel>	VM too is running "under" an OS.
Jul 12 12:34:28 <hortiel>	or better said on top of it
Jul 12 12:34:36 <slidercrank>	yes, but hardware is emulated well. That's enough for educational purposes
Jul 12 12:34:48 <hortiel>	ok. which cmd to do that
Jul 12 12:35:08 <slidercrank>	you can use VirtualBox or QEMU
Jul 12 12:35:35 <slidercrank>	knowing Assembly would be beneficial
Jul 12 12:37:01 <slidercrank>	hortiel, but what are you trying to achieve?
Jul 12 12:38:53 <slidercrank>	why can't you use SDL/OpenGL or any another graphics lib?
Jul 12 12:39:34 <hortiel>	slidercrank: sorry, I was just fascinated how I could change the bytes in /dev/sda and would like to "extend MY REACH" further down the rabbit hole.
Jul 12 12:40:15 <hortiel>	don't know C
Jul 12 12:40:20 <slidercrank>	not everything is a file in the Linux world (the concept everything is a file was extended in Plan9).
Jul 12 12:40:32 <slidercrank>	the network card is not a file, for example
Jul 12 12:40:52 <hortiel>	no in /dev I can *tons* of networking files...
Jul 12 12:41:01 <hortiel>	they are unbuffered though.
Jul 12 12:41:12 <slidercrank>	the same is the GPU. Something may be exposed with a file system. But not what you want
Jul 12 12:42:27 <slidercrank>	you cannot send a file over network by running # cat ~/cat_pix.gz > /dev/eth0
Jul 12 12:46:36 <hortiel>	are there any other tcp interfaces through which I can do that?
Jul 12 12:46:38 <hortiel>	surely there are
Jul 12 12:47:13 <slidercrank>	not via the file system
Jul 12 12:48:20 <slidercrank>	you have to communicate with the kernel. usually via a library.
Jul 12 12:49:44 <slidercrank>	that's the purpose or the division into the kernel space and userspace. Everything relating to hardware is done in the kernel space. You (from userspace) can only beg the kernel (via its driver) to do something for you. you cannot control hw registers directly
Jul 12 12:49:55 <slidercrank>	*purpose of
Jul 12 12:50:51 <slidercrank>	some interfaces are exposed via the file system. As in /dev/[hs]d[a-z][0-9].
Jul 12 13:13:37 <hortiel>	slidercrank: what If I use mknod to make some files, and then control it without using libs

Jul 12 13:18:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel, if you are wanting to recreate the wheel that is fine, not much we can do to help you in this channel
Jul 12 13:19:34 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: no I don't want to , just use existing tools, like mknode and simple commands without *code* hence no recreating.
Jul 12 13:19:51 <hortiel>	basically trivial ways to do stuff
Jul 12 13:20:08 <hortiel>	such as writing/reading files or some other simple cmd
Jul 12 13:20:13 <hortiel>	thast's it!!
Jul 12 13:20:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	hortiel,  so trival then why are you asking
Jul 12 13:20:44 <hortiel>	Southern_Gentlem: ?? because it can be done trivially after discovering it, not before

Jul 12 13:45:54 <sdgathman>	hortiel: to send a file over tcp I use nc
Jul 12 13:46:12 <sdgathman>	From the nmap-ncat package
Jul 12 13:46:38 <sdgathman>	nc 1.2.3.4 1234 <file
Jul 12 13:46:57 <sdgathman>	and on the other end, nc -l
Jul 12 13:48:24 <sdgathman>	If both ends are using an end-to-end encrypted VPN, then the transfer is even secure.
Jul 12 13:48:55 <Khaytsus>	That's utterly insane.

Jul 12 14:39:19 <Khaytsus>	essich1: You're 100% nobody has done this?  Often people ask these questions and it already exists in COPR, etc.
Jul 12 14:50:20 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: This is quite complicated! To add the package, I need an account (okay), need to sign a CLA (why?) and this needs approval.
Jul 12 14:52:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	because other wise the wiki gets filled with spam/pornbots
Jul 12 14:53:48 <essich1>	Maybe. But for e.g. Guix one simply needs to send an email to the bug tracker - no hazzle at all.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Southern_Gentlem: Thansk, but I'm giving up on this. Can't log-in. "your account must have at least one non cla* group to be able to login and edit" Whatever this means -  seams to be for experts only.
Jul 12 15:01:35 <essich1>	Is there another way to propose a package?

Jul 12 15:20:09 <Khaytsus>	Plus GDPR does not require you don't log it, as long as the logs are secure and not stored.
Jul 12 15:24:05 <essich1>	Khaytsus: I'm not going to discuss the GDPR, how to read it or how to configure apache - YMMV.
Jul 12 15:24:06 <essich1>	The link you posted removes the IP- address, while many admins want to keep an anonymizes one (e.g. for rough geo-location).

Jul 12 15:49:10 <prussian>	for such a small thing, you might be ebtter off standing up your own repo or just having customers use pip or some other packaging tool directly =/

Jul 15 20:28:30 <RagingBuffalo>	try again something else....
Jul 15 20:29:04 <RagingBuffalo>	I'm still on that "No input" with that T480s, fedora 30 and the official thunderbolt dockng station lenovo
Jul 15 20:29:14 <RagingBuffalo>	tried since 08h45 am
Jul 15 20:30:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	what were you doing using rufus
Jul 15 20:31:21 <RagingBuffalo>	I went trying to have a live bootable usb with windows, so I could flash the docking station firmware
Jul 15 20:34:07 <RagingBuffalo>	Wasted most of my time with that piece of junkware
Jul 15 20:34:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	will it work with the fwupdate in fedora
Jul 15 20:34:44 <RagingBuffalo>	They event give some sort of poor warning, you need to modify file stupi1dfyle.sys, with changing 1809 by 1803, otherwise you get bluescreen.
Jul 15 20:34:52 <RagingBuffalo>	There was no such 1809 in the file!!
Jul 15 20:35:11 <RagingBuffalo>	No idea, can we update the docking station with "FW update"?
Jul 15 20:35:45 <RagingBuffalo>	I tried numerous options, boltctl, display link drivers in dnf, etc...
Jul 15 20:35:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	you tell us
Jul 15 20:36:28 <RagingBuffalo>	Hm, I don't thnk it can do for the docking firmware.
Jul 15 20:36:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
Jul 15 20:36:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	crap
Jul 15 20:36:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	fwupd.x86_64 : Firmware update daemon
Jul 15 20:37:26 <RagingBuffalo>	hm... can I upload a fw of a docking through vibox?
Jul 15 20:37:34 <RagingBuffalo>	from theVM? I doubt it
Jul 15 20:39:50 <RagingBuffalo>	According to this it's only laptops
Jul 15 20:39:51 <RagingBuffalo>	https://fwupd.org/lvfs/devicelist
Jul 15 20:39:56 <RagingBuffalo>	not docking station
Jul 15 20:40:00 <RagingBuffalo>	(from lenovo)
Jul 15 20:41:15 <RagingBuffalo>	Well thanks for the help Southern_Gentlem, I finished for today, I'm at it since 08h45am I will try again tomorrow
Jul 15 20:43:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	RagingBuffalo, is this a fresh install that has been updated ?
Jul 15 20:43:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	also was the docking station plugged in during the install
Jul 15 20:45:58 <Khaytsus>	fwupd is useless for everything I've ever tried
Jul 15 20:46:06 <Khaytsus>	It lists a bunch of stuff but can't update any of it

Jul 15 21:23:21 <MrMc>	I just have installed a library in /usr/local/lib64 did ldconfig but still get bladeRF-cli: error while loading shared libraries: libbladeRF.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Jul 15 21:28:05 <prussian>	MrMc: do you have libbladeRF.so.2 in any particular location along your ld.so.conf declared paths?
Jul 15 21:29:08 <prussian>	well, if you put it /usr/{local/}lib64 it should have worked
Jul 15 21:29:35 <prussian>	have you tried using LD_LIBRARY_PATH just for the sake of sanity?
Jul 15 21:33:50 <MrMc>	I put it in /usr/local/lib64 and it did not work
Jul 15 21:34:39 <MrMc>	I have just installed it in /usr/lib64 and it works
Jul 15 21:35:53 <prussian>	might want to add a ld.so.conf for that then
Jul 15 21:36:15 <mroche>	I don't believe /usr/local/* is on the LD_PATH by default. At least it isn't on RHEL 7
Jul 15 21:36:26 <mroche>	I could be wrong...
Jul 15 21:36:53 <prussian>	/etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF with /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF and just drop libbladeRF.so into /usr/local/lib64/bladeRF
Jul 15 21:36:57 <prussian>	then ldconfig
Jul 15 21:37:07 <prussian>	well, /etc/ld.so.conf.d/libbladeRF.conf
Jul 15 21:40:39 <MrMc>	@prussian Thank you. I think installing in /usr/lib64 is easier
Jul 15 21:49:07 <Khaytsus>	Or just run it like LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path blackRF-cli
Jul 15 23:53:02 <RayTracer>	My upgrade from F29 to F30 didn't go so well. After ~1h I found `enforcing=0` and I could use the system again. Boot log contains lots of "avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:init_t:s0 tcontext= tclass=dbus" messages. Is such an issue known?
Jul 15 23:55:53 <dowdle>	RayTracer: First time I've heard of it... but... you should be able to do a relabel and see if that helps.
Jul 15 23:57:04 <linuxmodder>	seems I got clobbered in that netsplit too :(
Jul 16 00:00:52 <RayTracer>	dowdle: I did `touch /.autorelabel` but I think I'll defer the reboot to the next kernel update
Jul 16 00:01:20 <dowdle>	RayTracer: Manually reboot.
Jul 16 00:03:37 <RayTracer>	ok, I'm curious.. brb hopefully
Jul 16 00:11:47 <RayTracer>	dowdle: the relabel unfortunately didn't fix it
Jul 16 00:16:58 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've had an issue with the live media of my personal remix of Workstation having an SELinux issue... but I don't think it is related to your issue.  What types of errors do you see when trying to boot with SELinux on?
Jul 16 00:18:34 <RayTracer>	the system seems to boot normally, but doesn't run graphical login (lightdm), and trying multi-user.target I get a login prompt that doesn't log me in
Jul 16 00:18:51 <RayTracer>	sshd accepts my connection but doesn't present a shell as well
Jul 16 00:21:56 <dowdle>	RayTracer: I've done quite a few F2x -> F30 updates but not any recently.
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	according to the AVC messages something, or nothing, can talk to dbus?
Jul 16 00:21:57 <RayTracer>	"avc:  denied  { send_msg } for  scontext=system_u:system_r:xdm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext= tclass=dbus permissive=1 exe="/usr/bin/dbus-broker" sauid=81 hostname=? addr=? terminal=?'"

Jul 16 00:38:43 <RayTracer>	as root, using sudo -i
Jul 16 00:39:22 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  confirm it ran please ls -A /root | grep -i '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:39:33 <linuxmodder>	as root or sudo -i of course
Jul 16 00:41:10 <linuxmodder>	my apoligizes sudo ls -lA / | grep '.autorelabel'
Jul 16 00:42:19 <RayTracer>	fwiw, this is the failed boot log https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/HoRrrmvTb4cdRB62vvNn6A
Jul 16 00:42:43 <RayTracer>	linuxmodder: that grep doesn't show anything
Jul 16 00:43:11 <RayTracer>	it did the relabel process, I watched it on the screen
Jul 16 00:43:55 <linuxmodder>	RayTracer,  what locked down craziness are you running on that box ? :P
Jul 16 00:44:56 <linuxmodder>	looks more like a mdadm selinux fail first
Jul 16 00:45:19 <RayTracer>	ah, I have /proc mounted with hidepid=2 as an additional oddity
Jul 16 00:46:06 <linuxmodder>	the neednet=  ....  was crazy in itself
Jul 16 00:46:55 <RayTracer>	I don't know why multipath is in play at all..
Jul 16 00:47:11 <linuxmodder>	it is tho which is odd
Jul 16 00:47:23 <linuxmodder>	and that seems to be piling up to the dbus X11 part
Jul 16 00:47:33 <linuxmodder>	not seeing any smoking guns tho as to why
Jul 16 00:47:39 <RayTracer>	that line is needed unfortunately, because the dracut scripts insists on persisting the cmdline config to disk
Jul 16 00:48:11 <linuxmodder>	which part?
Jul 16 00:48:18 <linuxmodder>	the neednet part?
Jul 16 00:48:21 <RayTracer>	so I need to specify full network there, and not just the part needed for being able to ssh
Jul 16 00:48:23 <RayTracer>	yes
Jul 16 00:48:35 <linuxmodder>	that is insanity

Oct 11 15:54:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, use fpaste
Oct 11 16:05:00 <RMPR>	Hello, I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask but when I install hadoop suite with: dnf install "hadoop-*", I'm not able to use it with the default system jdk (8). I tried "import org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path;" and I get the error: "WordCount.java:4: error: package org.apache.hadoop.fs does not exist"
Oct 11 16:08:38 <RMPR>	I got this working with the manual install of hadoop (which is very painful) but then what is the purpose of having hadoop inside the main repository if it doesn't work ? 
Oct 11 16:09:05 <Lutinmalin>	here goes Southern_Gentlem https://paste.fedoraproject.org/paste/6YzDlNmg9GUC29g1M-evig
Oct 11 16:10:53 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Honestly, I'm not sure Fedora is the first place I'd go to for something like hadoop.  Unless you're setting up ephemeral VMs and tearing them down later.  Fedora has a fairly short life cycle, and hadoop is, to my general knowledge, pretty large data sets that likely live a long time.
Oct 11 16:11:55 <RMPR>	I thought about this channel because well, it's available on the main repos.
Oct 11 16:12:05 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: is there a readme in the hadoop package?
Oct 11 16:12:14 <FranciscoD>	Sometimes even after installation, some manual steps are required
Oct 11 16:12:38 <FranciscoD>	Generally maintainers put these steps in "README.Fedora" files in the packages
Oct 11 16:12:42 <RMPR>	I'm not sure how to verify this 
Oct 11 16:12:59 <FranciscoD>	rpm -qd <package> or look in /usr/share/doc/hadoop*
Oct 11 16:13:35 <FranciscoD>	Ah, also worth noting that hadoop is now orphaned: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/hadoop
Oct 11 16:13:51 <FranciscoD>	no builds for f31
Oct 11 16:14:50 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: what fedora releas are you on?
Oct 11 16:15:00 <RMPR>	fedora 30 workstation
Oct 11 16:15:37 <FranciscoD>	that's the last release with hadoop from the looks of it
Oct 11 16:16:44 <RMPR>	FranciscoD hadoop 2.7.6
Oct 11 16:16:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lutinmalin, thank you that way we dont get all the spam
Oct 11 16:16:54 <leden>	Lutinmalin: check 'tweaks' for 'suspend when laptop lid is closed' is on -- General
Oct 11 16:18:04 <RMPR>	FranciscoD even the NOTICE.TXT isn't that useful
Oct 11 16:18:24 <FranciscoD>	RMPR: yeh, it's unmaintained, so I don't expect it to be in good shape
Oct 11 16:20:01 <FranciscoD>	https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/hadoop/overview/
Oct 11 16:22:32 <Lutinmalin>	leden, not sure I understood you. I picked "suspend" in the power management settings. I also tried 'hibernate'
Oct 11 16:23:12 <Lutinmalin>	(I'm on LXQT)
Oct 11 16:24:19 <leden>	Lutinmalin: oh sorry i was think you running workstation
Oct 11 16:24:33 <Lutinmalin>	no worries
Oct 11 16:25:22 <Peetz0r>	hey! Is there a list of current fedora 31 release blocking bugs somewhere?
Oct 11 16:26:03 <FranciscoD>	Peetz0r: https://qa.fedoraproject.org/blockerbugs/
Oct 11 16:27:08 <Khaytsus>	RMPR: Not saying it won't work or is a terrible idea.. just that Fedora has a fairly fast life cycle compared to RHEL or CentOS etc.

Oct 11 20:52:17 <josvuk>	plocki: should i deaktivate it?
Oct 11 20:55:59 <plocki>	josvuk: first check if you are running openssh-server
Oct 11 20:56:56 <josvuk>	plocki: how to check it?

Oct 11 21:01:22 <plocki>	josvuk: i just checked my f30 desktop machine: sshd is not running by default. so you need to make it start: systemctl enable sshd

Oct 11 21:08:05 <josvuk>	no, i am on guest fedora30 ...
Oct 11 21:11:55 <josvuk>	but tried it now from cygwin prompt and from win10 comand prompt both the result from ssh josef@localhost -p 2222 is connection refused.
Oct 11 21:12:36 <josvuk>	from the host where virtualbox is running ...
Oct 11 21:14:04 <plocki>	josvuk: hm. does it work from guest host itself? ssh localhost
Oct 11 21:19:52 <josvuk>	plocki: Yes, it works i get a ssh connection from the host operating system Win10home to guest fedora30
Oct 11 21:20:39 <plocki>	josvuk:OK! if you want to connect from another host (i missed that point) you need to change the virtual-box nat rule: change host IP 127.0.0.1 to according local IP of Vbox-Host.
Oct 11 21:21:28 <plocki>	josvuk: after that you should reach yout box by ssh user@ip.of.xbox.host -p 2222
Oct 11 21:23:15 <josvuk>	hm, o.k can i simply add a new portforwarding rule?
Oct 11 21:23:59 <plocki>	josvuk: yes. and you need an according firewall rule on the windows box

Oct 11 21:34:01 <dowdle>	Figured it out (how to get a Let's Encrypt SSL cert for an unreachable server).  As long as you can make a DNS TXT record for the unreachable host you can do it with the following form:
Oct 11 21:34:10 <dowdle>	certbot -d www.whatever.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
Oct 11 21:34:18 <dowdle>	Then it'll spit out what DNS TXT record it wants with value it gives.
Oct 11 21:44:50 <yasumi2136>	i installed vim and without create ~/.vimrc i find it is already well-configured to edit JavaScript file (with indent, color syntax and so on) but i just want to modify the tabstop/shiftwidth to set it to 4. To try out, i created a ~/.vimrc with theses options but all configuration is modified
Oct 11 21:44:58 <yasumi2136>	how to change the indent tab option by keeping this default configuration provided by Fedora
Oct 11 22:30:10 <sdk>	Does anyone know could cause `Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1`. It prevents me from opening an application and I need to reboot. I've searched on the internet but what I found is related to ssh X forwarding. However, I don't use it.
Oct 11 22:32:20 <bugs_>	i've seen that where the home directory is read only
Oct 11 22:32:54 <sdk>	Nope. I have write permission.
Oct 11 22:33:14 <bugs_>	try ssh -x
Oct 11 22:33:54 <sdk>	bugs_: I got the error without using ssh.
Oct 11 22:34:22 <bugs_>	look at the owner and permissions on ~/.Xauthority
Oct 11 22:35:22 <bugs_>	check your DISPLAY environment variable too
Oct 11 22:37:13 <sdk>	DISPLAY is good and .Xauthority has 600. Should the permission be different?
Oct 11 22:37:20 <bugs_>	nope
Oct 11 22:37:47 <bugs_>	do you have an XAUTHORITY environment variable?
Oct 11 22:38:25 <sdk>	Yes. It returns the PATH of Xauthority file
Oct 11 22:39:36 <bugs_>	does it show a path of /run/user/nnnn/gdm/Xauthority?
Oct 11 22:39:41 <bugs_>	or a home directory path
Oct 11 22:39:58 <bugs_>	(i am assuming you are using Xorg and not Wayland)
Oct 11 22:41:52 <sdk>	homedir path. I don't have a Display Manager nor a DE. I autostart X in .bash_profile.
Oct 11 22:42:31 <bugs_>	so your .bash_profile/.bashrc is setting XAUTHORITY?
Oct 11 22:43:14 <bugs_>	if it is try commenting that out log out log back in
Oct 11 22:43:20 <sdk>	.bash_profile run `startx`
Oct 11 22:43:41 <sdk>	but there's nothing about .Xauthority in it.
Oct 11 22:46:06 <bugs_>	your DISPLAY is ":0"?
Oct 11 22:46:14 <sdk>	Yep
Oct 11 22:46:36 <bugs_>	bummer - the only other thing i can think of is some kind of file lock
Oct 11 22:46:43 <bugs_>	is the home directory on an nfs volume?
Oct 11 22:47:10 <sdk>	Nope. ext4 in LVM
Oct 11 22:47:51 <bugs_>	rofl how about two users with the same uid
Oct 11 22:48:31 <bugs_>	something is stopping the software from reading the contents of .Xauthority
Oct 11 22:48:40 <bugs_>	or the contents of .Xauthority don't match
Oct 11 22:49:03 <bugs_>	i've also seen that when the home dir volume was 100% full
Oct 11 22:49:19 <Peetz0r>	Hey! I just upgraded to F31, but display color profiles and night light seem to be broken. I found this bug online and it is reported as "already fixed" yesterday. I think it's this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1760254
Oct 11 22:49:36 <Peetz0r>	so why is it still broken on my system? I did upgrade everything and reboot
Oct 11 22:49:42 <sdk>	bugs_: Plenty of space. I'll check the id thingy
Oct 11 22:50:10 <bugs_>	yeah if you have two different usernames logged in with the same uid that
Oct 11 22:50:12 <bugs_>	can do it
Oct 11 22:51:09 <Peetz0r>	according to https://www.phoronix.com/forums/forum/software/desktop-linux/1131732-gnome-shell-mutter-3-34-1-deliver-on-their-prominent-fixes/page3 the fixes should have been available as updates yesterday already
Oct 11 22:51:32 <sdk>	bugs_: nope it isn't the id.
Oct 11 22:52:08 <bugs_>	i guess next i'd run "lsof | grep Xauthority
Oct 11 22:52:16 <sdk>	Strange. I run mostly the same settings on Debian and Arch without any trouble :/
Oct 11 22:52:18 <bugs_>	see if something else has it open
Oct 11 22:52:36 <bugs_>	do you have a config file in your .ssh
Oct 11 22:52:52 <sdk>	Yes I have.
Oct 11 22:53:06 <Peetz0r>	in other news, is koji offline?
Oct 11 22:53:43 <bugs_>	i might rename that config temporarily and see if that helps
Oct 11 22:54:01 <bugs_>	outer limits music is starting to play
Oct 11 22:55:20 <sdk>	Yep that's weird because I can pinpoint what's triggering it. I'll try renaming the file but I'll have to wait a bit to see if it will happen again. Thanks for the help.
Oct 11 22:55:33 <bugs_>	ok weird problem
Oct 11 22:55:59 <bugs_>	i worry about algo changes in ssh and ssl triggering something like this
Oct 11 22:56:27 <bugs_>	sometimes they disable a cipher you are using etc
Oct 11 22:57:16 <sdk>	We'll see. I'll try to remember what i'm doing right before it happens.
Oct 11 22:57:38 <bugs_>	oh i've had that happen when i su
Oct 11 23:28:24 <fdelapena>	hey guys are you able to dnf install python3-slugify or is also broken for you?

Oct 12 00:09:36 <nbags>	i've just switched to gnome-shell. having an issue where the Super-#keys (e.g. Super-1 to launch the first favourite app in the panel) is clashing with shortcuts i've created to switch between workspaces. how do i disable these favourite app shortcuts?
Oct 12 00:17:55 <kk4ewt>	settings keyboard-shortcuts
Oct 12 00:22:11 <nbags>	kk4ewt: where? i can't see an option to disable these favourites shortcuts
Oct 12 00:23:26 <kk4ewt>	there is always the tweaktool and gnomeshell-extensions
Oct 12 00:33:54 <nbags>	kk4ewt: i've looked in tweak tool
Oct 12 00:36:34 <nbags>	and a can't see an extension for this
Oct 12 00:43:18 <nbags>	ok, well here is the workaround: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1250

Oct 12 13:32:18 <yasumi2136>	i run on F30 LXDE with a laptop but my touchpad doesn't work for tap to click. I followed this page : https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_enable_touchpad_click#Other_window_managers , rebooted my system but still not working, any ideas?
Oct 12 13:33:26 <yasumi2136>	when i type echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE i get "x11" so i don't use Wayland
Oct 12 13:36:27 <diogenes_>	yasumi2136, afaik lxde is not developed anymore.
Oct 12 14:49:40 <Ilgaz>	I think kvirc crashed. I don't know if I could send my message or not. Here is the interesting thing. Fedora 30 is the only distro that can boot flawlessly on my HP Pavillion x360
Oct 12 14:50:01 <Ilgaz>	but fedora 31 freezes on boot, with only cursor appearing.
Oct 12 14:50:47 <Ilgaz>	I don't think a single byte of log etc produced as it is very early stage. I thought I better report this.
Oct 12 14:52:26 <Ilgaz>	I am downloading "rawhide" iso now. BTW, as you may guess, Live 31 beta ISO USB fails with same symptom too.
Oct 12 14:55:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Have you pressed "ESC" at the earliest Point, you can do that? You should see some errors, "behind"...
Oct 12 14:55:55 <Ilgaz>	No it is like nightmare for me and developers, nothing is written on screen or I would take a photo even
Oct 12 14:56:45 <Ilgaz>	Something in 30 stable makes it possible to boot, it doesn't exist on 31. Is the Kernel too different?
Oct 12 14:56:55 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: ouh, good luck!
Oct 12 14:56:56 <Khaytsus>	Kernel is different yes.
Oct 12 14:57:13 <whise_buddha>	I guess, Fedora 31 should use 5.3.5, am I right?
Oct 12 14:58:03 <Ilgaz>	Actually this is my 2nd Fedora install. I went frustrated with Broadcom 43142 not working so deleted it, reinstalled today so I can report things to developers&maintainers
Oct 12 14:58:59 <whise_buddha>	When it is you second install, dont use BETA.
Oct 12 14:59:08 <Ilgaz>	31, when working, at least initilized Broadcom 43142 without any networks visible. I was trying to re-create same setup.
Oct 12 14:59:10 <Khaytsus>	Ilgaz: where does it boot to?  You see grub?  Have you turned off rhgb and quiet?  maybe basic video?
Oct 12 14:59:16 <whise_buddha>	I guess the best way for you is to use STABLE
Oct 12 15:00:08 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: I am kinda used to pass parameters so yes, I removed hrgb and quiet, added verbose acpi=off
Oct 12 15:00:19 <Khaytsus>	and where does it boot to?
Oct 12 15:00:44 <Ilgaz>	Would adding vga=788 from Debian be a voodoo magic or would help anything on Intel HD 5500?
Oct 12 15:00:49 <Khaytsus>	no..
Oct 12 15:01:00 <Khaytsus>	that just sets the console mode, no point in that
Oct 12 15:01:37 <Ilgaz>	Khaytsus: Just a non blinking cursor with entire system frozen, external USB devices not powered back, caps lock led not working. Even CPU fan stopped
Oct 12 15:02:06 <Khaytsus>	so grub to blank screen and that's it?
Oct 12 15:02:25 <Ilgaz>	Yes. But Fedora 30 boots (the kernel from fedora 30)
Oct 12 15:02:56 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Is it an Option for you to install fedora 30 and then upgrade to fedora 31 BETA via dnf?
Oct 12 15:03:25 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I did exactly that. So, Fedora 30 kernel remains, 31 exists but doesn't boot
Oct 12 15:04:37 <Ilgaz>	I am particularly sad since fedora workstation is _the_ ideal distro for 2 in 1 laptop. It even figures the device concept change and shows virtual keyboard etc
Oct 12 15:05:19 <Ilgaz>	I will try the rawhide iso now. bbl
Oct 12 15:05:35 <whise_buddha>	Which Device is disfunctional in fedora for you, so that might be the reason for updating to Fedora 31?
Oct 12 15:06:14 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: broadcom 43142, a very particular hardware revision that is a nightmare to init
Oct 12 15:06:26 <whise_buddha>	is it wifi or bluetooth?
Oct 12 15:06:52 <Ilgaz>	a laptop without wireless is comical you know. Both wireless&bluetooth . I don't really care about bluetooth right now
Oct 12 15:07:38 <leden>	Ilgaz: did you install rpmfusion repos
Oct 12 15:07:41 <whise_buddha>	okay, so Fedora 30 can boot, but without wifi running, right?
Oct 12 15:07:41 <Ilgaz>	I even installed the dkms driver, didn't help. It was at least showing on 31
Oct 12 15:07:55 <Ilgaz>	ledeni: yes, I got the dkms one from them
Oct 12 15:08:01 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: Did you see that: https://tanmaync.wordpress.com/2017/12/02/install-broadcom-bcm43142-wifi-drivers-fedora/
Oct 12 15:08:28 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: yes, it was my first attempt
Oct 12 15:08:41 <Ilgaz>	It makes perfect sense however, it doesn't work
Oct 12 15:09:03 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: sry, but I cant help you. :(
Oct 12 15:09:16 <whise_buddha>	good luck!
Oct 12 15:09:20 <Ilgaz>	The idea is reporting these things with proper lspci -vvv etc so people won't live the issues
Oct 12 15:10:04 <Ilgaz>	whise_buddha: I am staring to an illuminated windows 10 dedicated key on this laptop, I mean this is like level 99 for Linux distros :-)
Oct 12 15:10:28 <whise_buddha>	Ilgaz: If it doenst work, think about to buy a USB-Stick with a supported wifi chip. It is very cheap, so.... ^^
Oct 12 15:11:26 <Ilgaz>	It seems like the only solution now, well, I keep reporting.
Oct 12 15:12:34 <Ilgaz>	BTW, in case anyone uses the official way to install broadcom from rpmfusion , there is a very interesting trick which is needed. You need to disable safeboot to modprobe wl
Oct 12 15:52:14 <f380cedric>	Hi, I'm trying to set my environment in wayland, but I cannot figure out why it's not working. I am setting my variables in .config/environment.d/99-defaults.conf. They don't appear in printenv nor systemctl --user show-environment. Any idea?

Oct 13 19:32:07 <malarivi>	I am trying to get prefix delegation handoff from my Fedora 30 Edge router to my internal 3750E switch. Has anyone done something like this? All I have running is nmcli with the eui64 address scheme
Oct 13 19:32:25 <malarivi>	I'm on ATT fiber with that horrible PACE router in passthru mode
Oct 13 19:44:44 <plarsen>	malarivi, I've tried with comcast but their instructions doesn't seem to work for IPv6 - no matter what I do for prefix deligation nothing seems to work.
Oct 13 19:45:00 <plarsen>	So if you find something that explains a methodology to follow please share :D
Oct 13 19:46:53 <plarsen>	Problem I have is that every IP in the prefix range is rejected by comcast ...
Oct 13 19:47:12 <malarivi>	I got it working using the 2001:DB8::1/64 with the radvd method but I want multicast working since we dont use RF cable anymore at home
Oct 13 19:48:17 <malarivi>	@plarsen what does your nmcli output look like for your wan interface? lets exchange notes? I see a /128, a /64 and a /60
Oct 13 19:49:48 <plarsen>	malarivi, ahhh, well I reset it all and this was done on CentOS6 when I struggled with it a few months ago.   I reverted everything to IPv4 only until I find a better option. I'll probably go the UniFi security gate route and leave my current CentOS box to be completely upgraded and reset, and just handle my internal lab stuff and not be the external edge router.
Oct 13 19:50:07 <plarsen>	Sorry - I wish I hadn't done that. I would love to have exchanged settings.
Oct 13 19:50:26 <plarsen>	CentOS6 != nmcli
Oct 13 19:50:42 <plarsen>	It's all the old network scripts.
Oct 13 19:51:34 <malarivi>	plarsen, check your channels for my msg. Should give some perspective
Oct 13 20:47:38 <first-order>	What if they replaced Fedora Branched with a rolling Fedora Stream implementation, and then had stable Fedora inbetween that and CentOS Stream?
Oct 13 20:58:09 <billings>	CentOS stream is just CentOS 8 with updates that will be in the next point release of CentOS
Oct 13 20:58:29 <billings>	if you want something like that, just turn on updates-testing
Oct 13 20:58:45 <billings>	or rawhide, I suppose, depending on your perspective
Oct 13 21:01:32 <Comnenus>	Has anyone gotten chrome-remote-desktop to work?  I have chrome and chromium installed, installed the chrome-remote-desktop package from repo, go to remotedesktop.google.com and install the extension.  Then it never prompts to enter the host information, I'm in a continuous loop  between remotedesktop.google.com and remotedesktop.google.com/access

Oct 18 15:53:28 <codebam>	ohhh I think I discovered the issue
Oct 18 15:53:29 <codebam>	so
Oct 18 15:53:36 <codebam>	I changed my username
Oct 18 15:53:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	whats the issue
Oct 18 15:53:48 <codebam>	and it seems to be looking in my old home folder
Oct 18 15:54:13 <codebam>	but I'm not exactly sure how to fix that. I could just create a folder and symlink it to my new home folder I guess
Oct 18 15:54:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	so everything works with a new user?
Oct 18 15:54:29 <codebam>	but there should be an option somewhere to remove that
Oct 18 15:54:49 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem I assume it would? considering the error I'm getting is just that it can't access the old images folder
Oct 18 15:55:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	so this is a PEBCAK
Oct 18 15:55:11 <codebam>	I haven't set up a new user yet
Oct 18 15:55:15 <codebam>	PEBCAK?

Oct 18 16:06:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	there will be a GO/NO-GO next thursday
Oct 18 16:06:52 <temple48>	goodness, feels like f30 was just a couple weeks ago
Oct 18 16:07:01 <coz_>	:)
Oct 18 16:07:22 <codebam>	where can I get signify on fedora?
Oct 18 16:07:42 <codebam>	why isn't it just in the official repos? isn't that like a standard package?
Oct 18 16:08:27 <Khaytsus>	temple48: Itw as.. for me ;)
Oct 18 16:08:43 <temple48>	Khaytsus: exactly
Oct 18 16:08:58 <Khaytsus>	Mostly because I hadn't had a spare round to it
Oct 18 16:09:03 <temple48>	got my last f29 machine up to f30 like a week ago, yeah
Oct 18 16:09:15 <temple48>	and now, kernel 5.3.6. amazing how quickly things move
Oct 18 16:30:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, because it isnt (not in fedora or rpmfusion
Oct 18 16:33:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, and when i google signify i am not finding anything that looks like FOSS
Oct 18 16:33:52 <codebam>	Southern_Gentlem https://github.com/aperezdc/signify
Oct 18 16:34:17 <codebam>	although I don't know if that's the official version. it's an openbsd tool
Oct 18 16:34:28 <codebam>	it's just as FOSS as OpenSSH is
Oct 18 16:36:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	codebam, so why do you need it when rpms are signed
Oct 18 16:37:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	(it appears you love installing things from outside the distro so nm)
Oct 18 16:45:28 <idlemind>	codebam what do you have for: virsh -c qemu:///session pool-dumpxml gnome-boxes
Oct 18 16:47:44 <idlemind>	might just need to delete that storage pool (or move it and it edit the path of the storage pool). if you delete it and want it to be recreated you could try closing gnome-boxes and set the first-run flag on the app: gsettings set org.gnome.boxes first-run true

Nov 07 14:10:49 <RMPR>	Hello, is there any reason for fedora maintainers to not package apache netbeans ?
Nov 07 14:14:55 <RMPR>	More specifically, my problem is I installed netbeans 11.2 from flatphub and I wasn't satisfied because I couldn't change the jdk version
Nov 07 14:15:12 <Khaytsus>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/NetBeans is the documented, suggested method.
Nov 07 14:16:03 <billings>	The package was orphaned because the maintainer never treid to get it to build on Fedora 30
Nov 07 14:16:38 <billings>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1675447 is the BZ showing that the packager got ample notice
Nov 07 14:17:16 <billings>	although I think there was a discussion on fedora-devel about how the java package maintainers were just ignoring email from bugzilla because they got so much
Nov 07 14:17:57 <knstn>	"alternatives --list" could be messing you out
Nov 07 14:21:39 <RMPR>	Khaytsus: thanks, although I'm still wondering why it's not packaged
Nov 07 14:22:50 <RMPR>	knstn: yeah it's useful only when you don't use the flatpak, because it comes with his own jdk.
Nov 07 14:23:05 <RMPR>	and you can't change that.
Nov 07 14:24:02 <billings>	it isn't packaged because the package maintainer stopped maintaining it.  It was retired.
Nov 07 14:24:33 <billings>	Fedora is a community maintained linux distro
Nov 07 14:25:21 <RMPR>	billings: yh
Nov 07 14:26:07 <billings>	yh?
Nov 07 14:27:29 <RMPR>	for yeah
Nov 07 14:27:59 <billings>	ok.
Nov 07 14:28:10 <billings>	That's short for "Okay" in case you were wondering.

Nov 07 18:54:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	bbigby64, did you see if there was an eclipse from modular ?
Nov 07 18:54:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	or copr
Nov 07 19:35:21 <hjek>	Hi, on my Fedora installation here, in Gnome Software I have 3 apps that are stuck in that they are "pending" installation. They persist even when restarting Gnome Software or Fedora. I can't cancel them, and when clicking on the check mark button the cancel button is also grayed out. I wonder, how can I reset or clear the Gnome Software (or PackageKit..?) install queue?
Nov 07 19:36:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek,  so if they are persistant time to go to the commandline and see whats up
Nov 07 19:37:34 <hjek>	@Southern_Gentlem: dnf behaves fine. It's only really in Gnome Software this issue is there.
Nov 07 19:37:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	what are the apps
Nov 07 19:37:52 <domhnall>	sounds like you're low on swap
Nov 07 19:37:59 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: programs; pieces of softwage, e.g. Inkscape
Nov 07 19:38:04 <hjek>	Plenty of swap
Nov 07 19:38:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	hjek, so flatpaks
Nov 07 19:38:35 <hjek>	domhnall: 1.5 GB swap free
Nov 07 19:39:10 <hjek>	Southern_Gentlem: Well, I'm not sure whether the ones that are stuck are flatpaks or not.
Nov 07 19:40:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	uname -r
Nov 07 19:40:14 <hjek>	5.3.8-200.fc30.x86_64
Nov 07 19:40:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	and what happens if you dnf install inkscape
Nov 07 19:42:25 <hjek>	So, it installs fine. But it's still listed as pending in Gnome Software, and every time I open Gnome Software I get this error popup that the app failed to install because it's "not compatible"...
Nov 07 19:42:33 <knstn>	I would also suggest "pkcon repair" && "pkcon refresh"
Nov 07 19:44:45 <hjek>	knstn: that fixed it. cool
Nov 07 19:45:51 <hjek>	ah, so that's the packagekit CLI..! interesting. didn't know about that one.
Nov 07 19:46:33 <hjek>	i'm not going to report this one as a bug unless I can figure out how to reproduce it. not sure how it happened.
Nov 07 19:47:05 <hjek>	knstn: No! They came back now, the apps, as "pending"!
Nov 07 19:49:37 <leden>	hjek,'killall gnome-software' &  'rm -rf ~/.cache/gnome-software'
Nov 07 19:52:27 <hjek>	leden: That's one of the first things I tried. I'll try it again, but the "pending" apps remain.
Nov 07 19:53:31 <hjek>	(Maybe I should just upgrade to f31 and see if the issue disappears...)
Nov 07 20:03:17 <leden>	hjek, what exactly apps are
Nov 07 20:04:19 <hjek>	leden: The apps that are stuck here are: calibre, Modem Manager GUI and Table (Inkscape extension)
Nov 07 20:47:00 <brejoc>	Hi folks! Quick question: You have a broken Salt package in Fedora 31 because python3-tornado is too new. Where can I report this?
Nov 07 20:48:46 <noln>	brejoc, "point of contact" at https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/salt
Nov 07 20:48:51 <noln>	brejoc, or channel #fedora-devel
Nov 07 20:49:24 <Khaytsus>	Or log a bug?
Nov 07 20:49:31 *	Khaytsus suggests brejoc try the following URL and let us know if it helps or they need more assistance: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugsAndFeatureRequests
Nov 07 20:53:04 <brejoc>	noln: Thanks! Looks like it was already fixed in rawhide. At least the changelog says so.

Dec 08 18:27:07 <latenite>	Hi folks, why does 'dnf remove' remove sooooo many packages? https://paste.ofcode.org/vrDr6nUsHrjC6pzyTpFuNg
Dec 08 18:27:58 <Khaytsus>	Because all those require kf5-kcmutils and then cascades from there
Dec 08 18:29:04 <Khaytsus>	Remove the devel package if you want, but removing the other one will remove most KDE stuff.
Dec 08 18:32:53 <latenite>	Khaytsus, how do I remove a package without removing the stuff that depends on it?
Dec 08 18:33:07 <Khaytsus>	You do not; they depend on it.
Dec 08 18:33:13 <latenite>	Like when I want to reinstall, in case I broke files
Dec 08 18:33:16 <Khaytsus>	Why would you think you need to remove kf5-kcmutils
Dec 08 18:33:31 <Khaytsus>	Why would you have broken files?  What in the world are you doing?  And anyway, dnf has a reinstall option.
Dec 08 18:33:38 <latenite>	like when I removed files of the package
Dec 08 18:33:41 <Khaytsus>	But yeah, if that's a problem, rethink what you're doing.
Dec 08 21:16:30 <abdulocracy>	Hey, after a recent update I've had tearing issues in Firefox
Dec 08 21:17:06 <abdulocracy>	Intel UHD 620 graphics
Dec 08 21:17:28 <abdulocracy>	I run GNOME on Xorg
Dec 08 21:17:47 <abdulocracy>	Previously was fine, happened pretty recently with an update
Dec 08 21:18:23 <abdulocracy>	Any ideas?
Dec 08 21:18:23 <wl_>	an update of what? Firefox, mesa, the kernel?
Dec 08 21:18:46 <abdulocracy>	I don't know, I just do an upgrade once or twice a week
Dec 08 21:20:30 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Tearing on X11 is extremely common.
Dec 08 21:20:42 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: If you don't want tearing, maybe run GNOME on Wayland.
Dec 08 21:21:18 <abdulocracy>	Well I have a more major graphical issue with Wayland
Dec 08 21:21:22 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: Every single system I've ever had for close to 2 decades now, has tearing.
Dec 08 21:21:38 <abdulocracy>	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/issues/1827
Dec 08 21:22:25 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I have to wonder if that is still the case with all of the updates.
Dec 08 21:23:17 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I'm definitely not claiming that GNOME on Wayland is perfect.
Dec 08 21:24:19 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: But generally speaking, Wayland was created to eliminate a lot of layers that are in X11... but GNOME requires accelerated 3D and that doesn't work so well on a wide range of chipsets.
Dec 08 21:27:07 <abdulocracy>	dowdle, just logged in to Wayland and the issue is definitely still there, no improvement
Dec 08 21:27:54 <abdulocracy>	The weird thing is with F30 it was entirely fine
Dec 08 21:28:14 <abdulocracy>	I used Wayland full time
Dec 08 21:28:55 <Acru>	Hey, whenever I try to report an error with the error reporting tool, I tells me that the retrace job failed, and the log shows that yum failed with the error `ERROR You need to update rpm to handle...`
Dec 08 21:29:00 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I guess differences with different kernel versions... with Fedora trying to follow upstream as much as possible.
Dec 08 21:30:37 <dowdle>	abdulocracy: I wish I had a fix for you.  You can go back to Fedora 30 if that helps... although now of course F30 is on the same kernel is F31.
Dec 08 21:32:06 <tairikuookami>	Acru, can you paste the output of 'uname -a' ?
Dec 08 21:32:19 <Acru>	`Linux acr.len 5.3.14-300.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Dec 2 15:41:35 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
Dec 08 21:34:19 <tairikuookami>	when did you last do a 'sudo dnf update' from the command line?
Dec 08 21:34:46 <Acru>	a few hours ago
Dec 08 21:35:54 <tairikuookami>	what's the application that is failing?  have you tried to just open a bugzilla report on it directly?
Dec 08 21:38:10 <Acru>	tairikuookami audacity, gnome-calendar, and fedora media writer
Dec 08 21:38:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami on the `Problem Report` bug?
Dec 08 21:39:34 <tairikuookami>	well, you could file bugzilla on audacity itself for having a problem in the first place.
Dec 08 21:41:31 <Acru>	tairikuookami But wouldnt be that the job of the problem reporting tool?
Dec 08 21:43:06 <tairikuookami>	you're using gnome.  the gnome bug reporting tool is garbage.  it's failing.  sure, if it actually *worked* you could expect it to file a bug on your behalf..  it's broken.  so it's up to you to file the bug report on the things that actually matter, which is more audacity and calendar and much less the bug-reporting-tool.
Dec 08 22:00:49 <Khaytsus>	the problem is not the 'gnome' bug reporting tool.  First off, it's not gnome. Second, yes, sometimes it wants to install a ton of debug stuff to get more data and it fails.  And yes, if you can reproduce the issue just log it manually.  Rather than it being automatic, with no context.
Dec 08 22:25:29 <Acru>	Khaytsus What should I do if I can not reproduce the fault?
Dec 08 22:33:17 <Khaytsus>	Acru: I suppose there's not much you can do.  If you know what might have caused it you could look for and log a bug but without some reproduction steps or notion of how to reproduce it, it'd be difficult for someone else to fix anything
Dec 08 22:33:40 <Acru>	Khaytsus ok, thank you
Dec 08 22:49:33 <cflag>	Greetings, I am attempting to update my grub.cfg and am receiving the error `/usr/sbin/grub2-probe: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/sda1.  Check your device.map.`, as well as `/dev/sdf: open failed: No medium found` which makes sense as there is no /dev/sdf on my system.
Dec 08 22:49:55 <cflag>	Checking /boot I do not seem to have a device.map file at all
Dec 08 22:50:24 <cflag>	There is no entry for /dev/sdf in my fstab
Dec 08 22:53:26 <cflag>	I only got these errors after upgrading to 31
Dec 08 23:10:36 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in the file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:17:19 <oppiet30>	What does npgo mean in this file name? firefox-71.0-8.npgo.fc30.x86_64
Dec 08 23:18:29 <[R]>	we heard you the first time...
Dec 08 23:18:35 <oppiet30>	laughs

Dec 08 23:26:03 <CharlesIC>	hello, i have a new monitor and im wondering if the refresh rate is set low.  how do i see?
Dec 08 23:26:05 <CharlesIC>	in fedora 31
Dec 08 23:26:34 <CharlesIC>	resolution is 3840x2160 / 16:9
Dec 08 23:26:54 <[R]>	xrandr will tell you the refresh rate
Dec 08 23:27:55 <CharlesIC>	   3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:27:56 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:28:00 <CharlesIC>	so it is at 30
Dec 08 23:28:10 <CharlesIC>	   1920x1080     60.00    59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98    60.00
Dec 08 23:28:17 <CharlesIC>	does this mean that i need to change it to 1920/1080 to get 60?
Dec 08 23:28:31 <[R]>	yes
Dec 08 23:28:46 <CharlesIC>	but it says 4096x2160 ... 59.94
Dec 08 23:28:52 <CharlesIC>	does that mean i can get arouind 60 for that one?
Dec 08 23:28:56 <[R]>	maybe
Dec 08 23:28:58 <[R]>	try it and see
Dec 08 23:29:26 <CharlesIC>	so i changed it to 4096x2160 9:5
Dec 08 23:31:13 <CharlesIC>	but how do i verify my current refresh rate?  https://paste.centos.org/view/353c7be1
Dec 08 23:31:23 <CharlesIC>	im on 4096x2160 right now
Dec 08 23:32:51 <CharlesIC>	is it for sure 59.94?
Dec 08 23:32:56 <CharlesIC>	from that output?
Dec 08 23:35:14 <CharlesIC>	oh, it was set at 30
Dec 08 23:35:34 <CharlesIC>	how do i change it to a higher one?
Dec 08 23:35:47 <oppiet30>	read xrandr man page
Dec 08 23:36:05 <CharlesIC>	i mean there is not a gui?
Dec 08 23:37:49 <oppiet30>	All's I see is for resolution.
Dec 08 23:38:07 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 -r 59.94
Dec 08 23:38:16 <CharlesIC>	that doesn't seem to do anything
Dec 08 23:38:31 <CharlesIC>	 3840x2160     30.00*+  59.94    50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:38:36 <CharlesIC>	it is still staying at 30
Dec 08 23:40:15 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:40:16 <CharlesIC>	trying this
Dec 08 23:40:18 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 75
Dec 08 23:40:31 <oppiet30>	randr --output HDMI1 --mode 1280x1024 --rate 60
Dec 08 23:40:32 <CharlesIC>	ok the line i just did fixed it
Dec 08 23:40:45 <CharlesIC>	3840x2160     30.00 +  59.94*   50.00    29.97    25.00    23.98
Dec 08 23:40:54 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:41:05 <CharlesIC>	so i guess i need to put this in my .xinitrc
Dec 08 23:41:08 <CharlesIC>	xrandr --output HDMI-0 --mode 3840x2160 --rate 59.94
Dec 08 23:41:17 <oppiet30>	You should have a file monitors.xml (~/.config/monitors.xml)
Dec 08 23:41:23 <CharlesIC>	oh, there is no .xinitrc. does fedora still use that?
Dec 08 23:41:39 <CharlesIC>	looking now
Dec 08 23:41:40 <oppiet30>	Edit that file.
Dec 08 23:42:11 <oppiet30>	https://askubuntu.com/questions/861416/changing-refresh-rate-for-specific-monitor
Dec 08 23:42:40 <CharlesIC>	oh i see
Dec 08 23:42:41 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:42:51 <CharlesIC>	so should i put 60 or 59.94, as xrandr shows that?
Dec 08 23:43:02 <oppiet30>	I don't know.
Dec 08 23:43:12 <CharlesIC>	ok, i changed monitors.xml
Dec 08 23:43:14 <CharlesIC>	thank you
Dec 08 23:43:19 <CharlesIC>	it did make the screen way brighter
Dec 08 23:43:55 <oppiet30>	You can google the monitor and look for specs, to see what it will support.
Dec 08 23:44:12 <CharlesIC>	well its set at 59.94 now
Dec 08 23:44:15 <CharlesIC>	it should support 60
Dec 08 23:44:17 <CharlesIC>	big improvement
Dec 08 23:44:22 <oppiet30>	Right
Dec 08 23:44:39 <CharlesIC>	now i can only do standard or dynamic for picture mode
Dec 08 23:44:40 <CharlesIC>	hmm
Dec 08 23:44:43 <CharlesIC>	no longer natural and other stuff
Dec 08 23:44:55 <oppiet30>	:)
Dec 08 23:45:22 <oppiet30>	Are you using gnome?
Dec 08 23:45:26 <CharlesIC>	cinnamon
Dec 08 23:45:33 <oppiet30>	I haven't sed that oneyet
Dec 08 23:45:45 <CharlesIC>	im talking about on my monitor/tv
Dec 08 23:45:49 <CharlesIC>	it previously had 4 modes
Dec 08 23:45:52 <CharlesIC>	now it only has 2, after changing
Dec 08 23:45:59 <oppiet30>	Ok
Dec 08 23:46:19 <CharlesIC>	ok thanks for your help everyone

Jan 02 11:19:01 <GPolonkai>	hello
Jan 02 11:19:44 <GPolonkai>	i just started a system upgrade (initiated from GNOME Software) on Fedora 31, and it’s reeeeeally slow (it’s running for almost 2 hours now, and it’s still at 26%
Jan 02 11:20:11 <GPolonkai>	is there a way to see what’s happening if i don’t have a root password set (thus, i can’t login on tty2..6)
Jan 02 11:35:01 <GPolonkai>	i guess rebooting the machine is a pretty bad idea
Jan 02 11:42:23 <tswsl1989>	I wouldn't advise it. Is there still disk activity? If so then it's probably still running the upgrade, just taking its time.
Jan 02 11:51:09 <Cybertinus>	hello, I'm running Fedora 31 KDE Spin with the XFCE desktop (I switched DE at some point ;) ). I have the XFCE NetworkManager Applet running. But this doesn't support Wireguard VPN tunnels. NetworksManager itself does support it (I can access the tunnel via nmcli). Is there a valid alternative for the NetworkManager Applet for XFCE that does support WireGuard?
Jan 02 11:51:38 <diogenes_>	GPolonkai, while it's upgrading, write an usb stick with Fedora on it, in case something goes wrong, you can re-install.
Jan 02 11:55:55 <topyli>	GPolonkai: you can't login at a tty if you don't have a root password? that's strange. do we have some new tty philosophy on fedora now?
Jan 02 11:56:29 <topyli>	i can login just fine, i just checked
Jan 02 11:57:13 <topyli>	first time in ages i saw a tty by the way :)
Jan 02 12:04:53 <GPolonkai>	tswsl1989: i can’t hear the disk doing something (luckily it has a HDD in it, as it’s a notebook without an HDD activity LED)
Jan 02 12:05:06 <GPolonkai>	diogenese: i always have one with me, just in case :)
Jan 02 12:05:51 <GPolonkai>	topyli: if you press “reboot and install upgrades”, you can’t login as an unprivileged user while the upgrades are running
Jan 02 12:06:33 <topyli>	ah so it's just during an upgrade. right
Jan 02 12:17:54 <GPolonkai>	i decided to go brave and pressed Ctrl-Alt-Delete; now it’s booting up seemingly fine…
Jan 02 12:18:45 <kwizart>	just FYI, a new version of the fedy tool is available, if anyone wants to request improvements of fixes, see also : https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/fedy/
Jan 02 12:57:08 <irreleph4nt>	Hello. I'd like to paste a file to paste.centos.org and am using the corresponding API example given on the website
Jan 02 12:57:20 <irreleph4nt>	but all curl returns is "invalid API key"
Jan 02 12:57:27 <irreleph4nt>	Is the documentation outdated?
Jan 02 12:57:48 <irreleph4nt>	Here is what I tried: curl -d private=1 -d name=irreleph4nt --data-urlencode text@winbinddpipe.ausearch https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 13:02:31 <irreleph4nt>	Okay, having worked around not being able to paste from cli, on to my actual problem: upgrading from fc30 server to fc31 via dnf broke selinux in context of winbind / samba for me
Jan 02 13:02:39 <irreleph4nt>	the AVC messages can be seen here: https://paste.centos.org/view/74081d36
Jan 02 13:03:33 <irreleph4nt>	The issue boils down to selinux denying access to /run/samba/winbindd/pipe for every service under the moon, which in turn renders me unable to use samba AD users to, for example, log in via SSH
Jan 02 13:04:16 <irreleph4nt>	I could create custom policies for each and every service on the box but instead would like to know how to fix this the right way
Jan 02 13:05:14 <irreleph4nt>	The directory and file are labeled like this: https://paste.centos.org/view/75d71b84
Jan 02 13:06:11 <irreleph4nt>	I already tried restorecon -R on the directory which changes the folder and pipe file from a samba label to winbind_var_run_t which does not solve the issue, though
Jan 02 14:08:03 <[adw]>	Hi, has anybody succesfully installed and got to work Unifi-controller on fedora server?

Jan 02 17:21:27 <yates>	are there any known issues getting this iso to boot off of liveusb: F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso
Jan 02 17:21:43 <yates>	?
Jan 02 17:22:25 <yates>	i flashed it using "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M"
Jan 02 17:22:32 <yates>	where "X" is appropriate
Jan 02 17:31:54 <RayTracer>	yates: ensure that there is nothing mounted from the usb (maybe automatically) before running dd
Jan 02 17:35:10 <yates>	i'm using a 4GB usb drive. is that big enough?
Jan 02 17:37:24 <RayTracer>	yates: should be enough, the iso seems to be 1.8GB
Jan 02 17:40:35 <RayTracer>	yates: and, as you're not using eg. "oflag=direct", you should run "sync" before unplugging/resetting
Jan 02 17:41:23 <RayTracer>	yates: besides that, I'm not aware of general issues
Jan 02 17:43:34 <yates>	ok, thanks RayTracer
Jan 02 17:54:22 <kk4ewt>	yates yes i tested that iso on a usb and there was no issue
Jan 02 17:54:41 <kk4ewt>	using dd and livecd-iso-to-disk
Jan 02 17:54:58 <yates>	kk4ewt: thanks - that is a good datapoint
Jan 02 17:55:43 <kk4ewt>	"dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:52 <kk4ewt>	 "dd if=F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20191206.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M"
Jan 02 17:55:59 <yates>	i am wondering if my brand of usb is inferior. i tried several attempts of flashes on several machines, none worked
Jan 02 17:56:04 <kk4ewt>	is the command i used
Jan 02 17:56:18 <kk4ewt>	yes you can have bad media
Jan 02 17:56:30 <yates>	it would be multiple bad media
Jan 02 17:56:38 <kk4ewt>	i have seen something say its 4G and only be 256M
Jan 02 17:57:00 <yates>	i tried two+ different pieces of usb by same mfr
Jan 02 17:58:08 <Khaytsus>	If a dd is too big to a media, it'll fail.
Jan 02 17:58:22 <Khaytsus>	Someone probably hasn't checked a checksum or something.
Jan 02 17:58:24 <yates>	it was an el-cheapo 4G usb off amazon
Jan 02 17:58:29 <yates>	i checked
Jan 02 17:59:24 <kk4ewt>	goto walmart and get a good media
Jan 02 18:00:40 <yates>	ha !
Jan 02 18:06:27 <RayTracer>	maybe it's also time to ask how it fails.. like: does the machine boot from usb at all
Jan 02 18:30:54 <yates>	RayTracer: yes, it boots, but after a long time and many dracut timeout messages it throws me into dracut
Jan 02 18:31:18 <yates>	it boots "sorta"
Jan 02 18:35:08 <RayTracer>	yates: maybe a web search for the hardware model reveals some workaround like acpi=off
Jan 02 18:54:41 <yates>	works with an ubuntu live cd
Jan 02 18:55:30 <RayTracer>	ok, this makes it look like it's not that :)
Jan 02 19:01:36 <yates>	lol
Jan 02 19:06:31 <bugs_>	curious about yates computer type
Jan 02 19:06:54 <bugs_>	it sounds like a usb3 / usb2 issue
Jan 02 19:34:33 <razorfreak>	hello, can someone help me with brightness issue? the keys aren't working.
Jan 02 19:34:52 <sfranken>	F lock?
Jan 02 19:35:35 <razorfreak>	other keys are working except the brightness keys
Jan 02 19:36:11 <sfranken>	Is the key mapped to brightness in the settings?
Jan 02 19:36:48 <razorfreak>	when I press the key, brightness logo comes up
Jan 02 19:37:00 <razorfreak>	I think they are mapped
Jan 02 19:37:02 <sfranken>	That would be a "yes", then
Jan 02 19:37:16 <razorfreak>	I run F31, I tried this on F30 also
Jan 02 19:38:03 <razorfreak>	my laptop is DELL XPS 15 7590
Jan 02 19:39:06 <razorfreak>	xbacklight also doesn't work
Jan 02 19:40:28 <sfranken>	Let me check, I have the XPS 15 9560
Jan 02 19:41:31 <sfranken>	hmm, the keys work as expected on that machine
Jan 02 19:42:54 <razorfreak>	sfranken, so is there any way? I have been stuck trying to fix this for the last 3 days
Jan 02 19:43:52 <sfranken>	I don't know. Mine work out of the box...
Jan 02 19:44:30 <sfranken>	You could also adjust it from the menu at the top right, but that's more work
Jan 02 19:44:49 <razorfreak>	that is also not working
Jan 02 19:44:53 <razorfreak>	xrandr seems to be working
Jan 02 19:46:20 <sfranken>	hmm... What GPU is in your machine?
Jan 02 19:46:23 <sfranken>	And wayland or X11?
Jan 02 19:50:09 <razorfreak>	nvidia 1650
Jan 02 19:50:12 <razorfreak>	x11
Jan 02 19:50:38 <sfranken>	Does your laptop have an Intel GPU as well?
Jan 02 19:50:57 <razorfreak>	I think no
Jan 02 19:52:12 <razorfreak>	oh yes, intel uhd graphics 630
Jan 02 19:54:28 <sfranken>	Could you check what happens if you try the keys with the nvidia card blacklisted/disabled in the bios?
Jan 02 19:57:54 <razorfreak>	I am sorry, how do I do that?
Jan 02 20:00:43 <razorfreak>	I found something, I will check this https://nmilosev.svbtle.com/perfection-today-running-fedora-on-dell-xps-7590
Jan 02 20:01:12 <sfranken>	Reboot, and when you see the Dell logo press escape. That should get you into the bootmenu for Fedora (grub). Press E to edit and add "rd.driver.blacklist=nouveau nouveau.modeset=0" at the end of the linux....... line
Jan 02 20:01:57 <sfranken>	Ah, oled screen.. Those can't be changed the same way as other screens
Jan 02 20:03:09 <razorfreak>	so at least it should be handled right?
Jan 02 20:03:10 <sfranken>	(Becuase oled has no conventional backlight, which can't be brightned or dimmed)
Jan 02 20:04:16 <Khaytsus>	sfranken: Sure oled can be dimmed :P  But certainly maybe handled in a different way.
Jan 02 20:04:48 <sfranken>	Khaytsus: Yes it can be dimmed, just not in the conventional way by modifiying the backlight strength
Jan 02 20:05:11 <Khaytsus>	razorfreak: if you can pick a specific intel or nvidia device in the BIOS config, I'd just do that.  Optimus stuff is annoying.
Jan 02 20:13:27 <currybullen>	i've been having some trouble with a bluetooth headset and suspend, where my headset will not reconnect after resuming. i've noticed that it only happens when i do a hybrid suspend, both hibernate and ordinary suspend work fine. when the headset won't reconnect, the only thing that seems to help is a reboot followed by a manual reconnect
Jan 02 20:14:33 <currybullen>	is the bluetooth service not configured to resume after a hybrid suspend or something?
Jan 02 20:14:56 <sfranken>	Like I asked you before: what happens if you disconnect the BT and then reconnect?
Jan 02 20:15:20 <sfranken>	You probably, mostly, have a bluetooth card that doesn't get initialized right after your machines wakes up from suspend
Jan 02 20:16:52 <currybullen>	hmm, how would you like me to disconnect the BT? its integrated into my network card. switching it on and off with rfkill does not help
Jan 02 20:17:07 <sfranken>	From the gnome settings?
Jan 02 20:18:31 <currybullen>	i use cinnamon, which usses blueberry. disabling/enabling it there does nothing. i've also tried blueman with the same result
Jan 02 20:18:59 <shimsh>	chromium-libs-media-freeworld (updates) requires chromium-libs = 77.0.3865.90-2.fc30, but i can't find a matching version anywhere - dnf states the deps are broken too
Jan 02 20:19:07 <sdgathman>	sfranken: I have a similar problem with Intel wifi driver.  I have to remove/reload iwlmvm driver in /usr/lib/systemd/system-sleep/iwlmvm.sh
Jan 02 20:19:11 <shimsh>	anyone else having this issue?
Jan 02 20:19:22 <sdgathman>	And also restart wpa_supplicant
Jan 02 20:20:13 <sdgathman>	Should this be reported as a kernel bug?  Or is the reinitialization supposed to happen in systemd?
Jan 02 20:20:21 <shimsh>	https://fedora.pkgs.org/30/rpmfusion-free-updates-x86_64/chromium-libs-media-freeworld-77.0.3865.90-2.fc30.x86_64.rpm.html
Jan 02 20:35:41 <kwizart>	shimsh, unfortunately chromium-libs-media-freeworld is unmaintained you need to move to chromium-freeworld
Jan 02 20:53:36 <shimsh>	thanks kwizart
Jan 02 20:58:02 <yates>	RayTracer et al: newsflash: the problem with my liveusb was my cheap thumbdrives
Jan 02 20:58:19 <yates>	i used my officemate's thumbdrive and it worked fine
Jan 02 20:58:37 <kk4ewt>	yates told ya
Jan 02 20:59:03 <yates>	...but i'm so glad i saved $10
Jan 02 20:59:23 <yates>	(that's a joke ^^^^^(
Jan 02 21:07:15 <sfranken>	"Yeah, but I save X amount because I buy cheap stuff" ... most people who say that don't realise their cheaper model doesn't last as long, so while I buy 3 expensive drives that last me years, they buy 10 in the same time
Jan 02 21:09:32 <tzfrs>	Hi guys. I broke my system. I added my ssd to fstab, but then wanted to make it work under windows as well so I formatted it to ntfs
Jan 02 21:10:04 <tzfrs>	Now I always get emergency mode where I can't do anything because the root account is locked and I have no live medium
Jan 02 21:10:27 <tzfrs>	Is there a way to boot into a bash without anything being loaded so I can edit the fstab?
Jan 02 21:11:22 <bugs_>	have you tried to boot in run level 1?
Jan 02 21:11:47 <bugs_>	edit the grub boot linux line and add 1 at the end, then boot
Jan 02 21:11:49 <tzfrs>	Do u just need to add a 1 to the end of the boot entry line?
Jan 02 21:11:51 <tzfrs>	Kk
Jan 02 21:12:14 <bugs_>	this is assuming things like the root volume isn't encrypted etc
Jan 02 21:12:21 <tzfrs>	It's not
Jan 02 21:12:45 <tzfrs>	Doesn't look good so far.
Jan 02 21:12:55 <sfranken>	tzrfs: Your SSD can't be found anymore, since the UUID has changed because you repartitioned / reformatted it...
Jan 02 21:13:35 <tzfrs>	Yes I know. But how can I remove the line from fstab?
Jan 02 21:13:40 <bugs_>	ok if the uuid in the grub entries has changed thats not going to work
Jan 02 21:13:55 <sfranken>	vim /etc/fstab tzfrs
Jan 02 21:14:08 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, I don't get any shell
Jan 02 21:14:39 <sfranken>	hmm, right... locked root account and all that
Jan 02 21:14:46 <tzfrs>	Yes
Jan 02 21:14:59 <kawazu>	Boot with the installer usb?
Jan 02 21:15:00 <sfranken>	Phyiscally remove the SSD (disconnect the SATA cable) and boot again
Jan 02 21:15:04 <sfranken>	brb
Jan 02 21:15:11 <tzfrs>	I only have a win USB stick.
Jan 02 21:15:15 <tzfrs>	Which doesn't seem to work.
Jan 02 21:15:35 <tzfrs>	Sfranken, does this really solve it? I mean the wrong entry would still be there wouldn't it?
Jan 02 21:15:56 <bugs_>	another boot option is init=/bin/bash
Jan 02 21:16:03 <bugs_>	but that assumes the grub configuration is ok
Jan 02 21:16:26 <tzfrs>	Where do I put that? Also where the 1 is at the end?
Jan 02 21:16:36 <bugs_>	yes replace the 1
Jan 02 21:16:47 <tzfrs>	K, one sec
Jan 02 21:16:55 <bugs_>	you would have to know how to navigate in an empty environment
Jan 02 21:16:58 <bugs_>	i.e. no path
Jan 02 21:17:45 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:20:08 <tzfrs>	Hm. Somehow I don't think it saved my changes.
Jan 02 21:20:32 <tzfrs>	What was the save and exit cmd for vim again?
Jan 02 21:20:54 <sfranken>	:wq
Jan 02 21:21:04 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:22:21 <sfranken>	But I thought you had "noauto" passed as a mounting option?
Jan 02 21:22:38 <sfranken>	Oh, wait, nvm
Jan 02 21:22:44 <tzfrs>	The file is readomly
Jan 02 21:22:46 *	sfranken is working on too much at the same time
Jan 02 21:22:48 <knaccc>	hey peeps, just wondering: normally fedora is not recommended in production i think because sudden changes may break things in packages. i was wondering if fedora would be suitable in production if you're not really using many packages, e.g. because you're mostly just running java on it with your own download and install of java. or are there other reasons that fedora in production is a bad idea?
Jan 02 21:23:00 <tzfrs>	Can I make it to 777 just for now and change it back again after fixing?
Jan 02 21:23:05 <bugs_>	mount -o remount,rw /
Jan 02 21:23:12 <sfranken>	tzfrs: Remount read-write
Jan 02 21:23:15 <sfranken>	thanks bugs_
Jan 02 21:23:37 <sfranken>	knaccc: Who says Fedora isn't recommended in production?
Jan 02 21:23:50 <tzfrs>	Ty
Jan 02 21:24:02 <sfranken>	(It really depends on your situation, though.. Our school works fine with our Fedora labs)
Jan 02 21:24:06 <knaccc>	sfranken i think most people would say to use centos over fedora in production, because each release of fedora only has 6 months of support
Jan 02 21:25:10 <tzfrs>	I'm in
Jan 02 21:25:14 <tzfrs>	Thank you all!
Jan 02 21:25:38 <sfranken>	7 months knaccc. X + 1 where X is the version number. Yes, that's short. Like I said, it depends on what you use the machines for
Jan 02 21:25:57 <sfranken>	As I said: our Fedora lab at the school I work for runs fine. Has been running fine for 4 years now
Jan 02 21:26:04 <sfranken>	with upgrades from release to release
Jan 02 21:27:32 <knaccc>	what i'm scared of is that suddenly the new fedora comes out, and it makes changes that require a couple months of redevelopment of server mainteance and deployment scripts to adapt to, and during that period you aren't able to upgrade yet so miss out on critical security patches
Jan 02 21:28:24 <knaccc>	put it this way: are there huge advantages to being on the latest kernel that fedora has, in terms of better performance/concurrency, or in terms of security hardening?
Jan 02 21:29:09 <knaccc>	or does it not really make a difference whether i'm on kernel 5.3 vs 3.10
Jan 02 21:29:15 <sfranken>	That's why you have a few machines and servers running outside your normal network to test stuff on, right?
Jan 02 21:29:54 <sfranken>	But if you want mission critical and low changes: go centos. Again, depends on what you're going to use them for
Jan 02 21:30:01 <sfranken>	Can't really give you an answer withouth that info
Jan 02 21:30:13 <knaccc>	well yeah it's possible to do my own testing for performance improvements, but impossible for me to do my own testing for security hardening improvements
Jan 02 21:30:51 <knaccc>	for that i need some kind of commentary on what changed between 5.3 vs 3.10 in terms of security hardening
Jan 02 21:31:22 <sfranken>	Wouuldn't the changelogs provide you with that?
Jan 02 21:32:14 <knaccc>	sfranken yeah i'm wondering if anyone has an answer that is better than "go research it yourself"
Jan 02 21:33:31 <sfranken>	I'm not sure you're going to get what you want then..
Jan 02 21:33:41 <knaccc>	e,g, i don't really know how to reason about whether the new "kernel lockdown" changes are a big deal https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=aefcf2f4b58155d27340ba5f9ddbe9513da8286d
Jan 02 21:33:49 <sfranken>	AFAIK the kernel release notes are your "goto source" for this kind of info
Jan 02 21:34:13 <knaccc>	yeah finding the release notes is one thing. interpreting the significance of them is an entirely different ball game
Jan 02 21:34:26 <knaccc>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions
Jan 02 21:34:40 <knaccc>	but it's gonna take me probably the whole day at least to try and delve into what all of these things mean
Jan 02 21:35:49 <sfranken>	hmm...
Jan 02 21:36:06 <sfranken>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
Jan 02 21:36:32 <sfranken>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
Jan 02 21:37:48 <knaccc>	ok thanks
Jan 02 21:40:26 <sfranken>	Same goes for CentOS though
Jan 02 21:41:14 <knaccc>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
Jan 02 21:41:37 <knaccc>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
Jan 02 21:42:19 <sfranken>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
Jan 02 21:42:25 <sfranken>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
Jan 02 21:42:59 <sfranken>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
Jan 02 21:43:17 <sfranken>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
Jan 02 21:43:38 <knaccc>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using
Jan 02 21:43:57 <sfranken>	And some driver backports
Jan 02 21:44:16 <sfranken>	Things like CPU support for new(er) Intel/AMD CPU's and stuff like that
Jan 02 21:44:37 <knaccc>	oh interesting, i didn't know about cpu support backports in centos, thanks!
Jan 02 21:45:03 <sfranken>	Not sure about CentOS 7.x though, I'm not running 7.x anymore
Jan 02 21:45:27 <knaccc>	i was told in #centos that centos 8 is currently a bit of a mess in terms of package support
Jan 02 21:45:39 <knaccc>	so to stick to centos 7.7 for now
Jan 02 21:45:41 <sfranken>	It's still rough around the edges, but for me it works
Jan 02 21:45:59 <sfranken>	For what I need CentOS 8 has better support than 7
Jan 02 21:46:07 <knaccc>	what are your needs?
Jan 02 21:46:08 <sfranken>	(Webserver with modern PHP requirements)
Jan 02 21:46:11 <knaccc>	ah ok
Jan 02 21:46:27 <knaccc>	did you hit any snags with centos 8?
Jan 02 21:46:43 <sfranken>	For the webservers I didn't
Jan 02 21:47:11 <sfranken>	for the Python lab we did. We were testing to see if we could move that over to CentOS 8 as well. But Python3 acted strangely with the teachers material
Jan 02 21:47:19 <sfranken>	so we kept Fedora 30 (31 now)
Jan 02 21:49:49 <knaccc>	interesting, thanks
Jan 02 21:51:33 <sfranken>	No problem
Jan 02 22:06:09 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: So you're saying that the CentOS kernel is slow..  the distro that holds the vast majority of servers in the world..  k
Jan 02 22:10:39 <kawazu>	Is the new Ryzen the way to go these days?
Jan 02 22:11:44 <knaccc>	Khaytsus i'm not saying it's slow, i'm wondering whether it is or not. if kernel 5.3 from 2019 is not much faster than kernel 3.10 from 2013, then fine
Jan 02 22:12:17 <prussian>	given RH's backportiness, it's basically impossible to make version upstream to upstream comparisons
Jan 02 22:12:34 <knaccc>	i'm wondering whether new io schedulers optimized for nvme and new thread schedulers will make a big difference or not
Jan 02 22:12:57 <prussian>	best guess is no and RH might just backported it anyhow.
Jan 02 22:13:33 <sfranken>	Only way to know for sure is test on your actual hardware
Jan 02 22:21:36 <Khaytsus>	knaccc: Again, probably _millions_ of servers use CentOS.  So..
Jan 02 22:23:18 <knaccc>	Khaytsus yeah thanks, it's a good point that does make me feel a little better
Jan 02 22:23:47 <knaccc>	it also makes me wonder why the kernel has not made significant enough performance increases in the last 6 years
Jan 02 22:24:02 <knaccc>	significant enough to warrant more people to upgrade
Jan 02 22:24:54 *	Khaytsus facepalms
Jan 02 22:24:54 <prussian>	probably because all the low hanging fruit has been had. also note all the hardware wiggling around certain class of hardware bugs
Jan 02 22:26:04 <prussian>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.
Jan 02 22:26:52 <knaccc>	interesting
Jan 02 22:27:01 <prussian>	I guess?
Jan 02 22:27:37 <prussian>	if you're currently using fedora, you're basically running the near tippy top of what kernel.org is shipping as stable. I'm surprised you haven't had any issues from that.
Jan 02 22:29:54 <yates>	how do you access root in f31 gnome ? i don't just want to sudo a command, i want to log in
Jan 02 22:30:29 <sfranken>	You don't
Jan 02 22:30:44 <sfranken>	You can however `sudo su -`
Jan 02 22:30:53 <yates>	i do
Jan 02 22:30:57 <yates>	and i will
Jan 02 22:31:20 <sfranken>	You could unlock the root account and set a password
Jan 02 22:31:40 <sfranken>	sudo passwd -u root && sudo passwd root
Jan 02 22:32:08 <sfranken>	But not *really* sure that's a sane idea and all, the root acount being scrambled is done for a reason I'm sure
Jan 02 22:37:15 <yates>	to piss people off
Jan 02 22:37:47 <prussian>	if you set your user up as an "administrator" it forgoes asking for a root password.
Jan 02 22:37:55 <prussian>	at least if you installed with anaconda
Jan 02 22:38:51 <sfranken>	Yeah because it's *so* much work to type sudo -i yates
Jan 02 22:39:02 <sfranken>	Sorry, I'm not getting your issue with root being scrambled
Jan 02 22:39:24 <prussian>	it shouldn't even have a password configured, other than an invalid hash "!!"
Jan 02 22:40:28 <yates>	you are free to operate your linux distro how you wish
Jan 02 22:41:06 <sfranken>	True, but why the issue then? Unlock the account and be happy about iut?
Jan 02 22:41:08 <sfranken>	*it
Jan 02 22:41:12 <prussian>	truly
Jan 02 22:41:31 <prussian>	I operate my fedora with all sorts of zany customizations
Jan 02 22:41:45 <prussian>	not sure how having to set up a root password impedes this.
Jan 02 22:42:14 <yates>	the issue is people who think they know how i should use a computer
Jan 02 22:42:22 <yates>	and i am
Jan 02 22:42:45 <prussian>	ight.
Jan 02 23:08:59 <janos_>	i have to agree - freedom of use being a core tenent and all
Jan 02 23:09:16 <janos_>	even if not considered a "best practice"
Jan 02 23:10:32 <sfranken>	Oh I totally agree, it's just that sometimes something is put in place for very good reasons. I hated root access being dropped or locked out, untill I read the reasoning behind it (not Fedora specific, this was in the Ubuntu days for me). After I read that I changed my opinion
Jan 02 23:12:24 <j^2>	i was trying to post something to paste.centos.org, and getting "invalid api key" kicked back, how can i request one?
Jan 02 23:13:05 <sfranken>	How are you trying to post it j^2?
Jan 02 23:13:08 <sfranken>	with fpaste?
Jan 02 23:13:18 <j^2>	curl -d text='this is my text' https://paste.centos.org/api/create
Jan 02 23:13:23 <j^2>	from the example
Jan 02 23:13:39 <j^2>	i wanted to set up some bash foo to get some autoposting
Jan 02 23:16:10 <sfranken>	Can't you use fpaste in your bash foo then?
Jan 02 23:16:25 <j^2>	i haven't given the fpaste a shot tbh, let me try it out
Jan 02 23:18:26 <j^2>	sfranken, yep, fpaste worked fine. interesting that the direct curl to the API doesn't :-O
Jan 02 23:19:46 <RayTracer>	sudo -i
Jan 02 23:19:58 <j^2>	heh, there's a hard coded API key in fpaste: https://pagure.io/fpaste/blob/master/f/fpaste#_34
Jan 02 23:20:01 <janos_>	if you vi/vim fpaste you'll see why
Jan 02 23:22:05 <j^2>	sfranken, heh, well i can do the create now with curl...
Jan 02 23:22:34 <sfranken>	Is the text you're parsing not fpast'able?
Jan 02 23:23:22 <j^2>	oh no, i was just looking through the readme, saw the curl directly to API so figured i'd give it a shot. There was no place to say "request an API key" hence my poking and asking here
Jan 02 23:24:40 <janos_>	you might want to use fpaste in the script since it will be maintained - like if the api key changes or something else changes
Jan 02 23:25:07 <j^2>	janos, makes sense thank you
Jan 02 23:25:16 <janos_>	yw

Jan 22 11:45:18 <archuserau>	Hey all. Just installed Fedora on an MSI gaming laptop. The only issue is it can only see the nvidia gpu not the integrated intel gpu.
Jan 22 11:49:51 <kwizart>	archuserau, is it disabled in your bios/efi ?
Jan 22 11:51:34 <archuserau>	There is no option for it in my bios. I will check if there is an update
Jan 22 12:00:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: What do you mean by "only see" ? Is it because it only use the nvidia driver or is it because the Intel gpu don't show up in lspci ?
Jan 22 12:03:02 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is it present when you do lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)" ?
Jan 22 12:04:29 <archuserau>	It does not seem to show up in lspci
Jan 22 12:05:08 <archuserau>	Only the nvidia shows up with that command dfstorm
Jan 22 12:06:32 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Is you computer a laptop or a desktop ?
Jan 22 12:06:43 <dfstorm>	your*
Jan 22 12:07:18 <archuserau>	Laptop.
Jan 22 12:07:41 <kwizart>	archuserau, which exact model do you have ? are you sure it's an optimus laptop ?
Jan 22 12:07:44 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Sorry.. I just saw you already said it
Jan 22 12:08:06 <archuserau>	kwizart: There is a gpu button that works in windows
Jan 22 12:08:12 <archuserau>	dfstorm: no worries.
Jan 22 12:09:16 <dfstorm>	archuserau: As root, is the directory "/sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/" present ?
Jan 22 12:09:59 <archuserau>	dfstorm: Doesnt seem to be
Jan 22 12:10:03 <ossifrage>	I'm stuck running an old kernel (4.19.8) after my last reboot VirtualBox decided to stop working throwing a VERR_VM_DRIVER_VERSION_MISMATCH
Jan 22 12:10:04 <dfstorm>	archuserau: And are you using the laptop display or a pluged in display ?
Jan 22 12:10:16 <archuserau>	Using the laptop display.
Jan 22 12:10:25 <ossifrage>	I'm having trouble picking all the matched versions to get things to work again
Jan 22 12:11:14 <ossifrage>	I have the kmod-VirtualBox-4.19.8-300, but it seems that something else is wrong
Jan 22 12:12:31 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Well, you're having the same kind of laptop that I have; Optimus is not supported "natively". You're saying there is a "physical switch" to switch between nvidia and intel ?
Jan 22 12:12:57 <archuserau>	dfstorm: It is a button not a switch. In windows it work. In linux it doesnt.
Jan 22 12:13:06 <archuserau>	It is a MSI GT75vr
Jan 22 12:13:40 <archuserau>	What laptop do you have dfstorm ?
Jan 22 12:13:44 <ossifrage>	It was working fine before the reboot, I didn't think anything had changed and I had a vm running prior to reboot
Jan 22 12:13:59 <archuserau>	Give me a minute. I will boot into a different linux distro and see what happens.
Jan 22 12:14:50 <dfstorm>	archuserau: My guess is that by default your system will boot on nvidia.
Jan 22 12:15:10 <archuserau>	I am a little bit disapointed that I cannot turn the nvidia card off in the bios.
Jan 22 12:15:33 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Welcome to the "blackboxed" land of gaming laptop :(
Jan 22 12:15:52 <archuserau>	What do you mean blackboxed? What do you have?
Jan 22 12:16:00 <dfstorm>	archuserau:  I have a System76 Oryx 4
Jan 22 12:16:13 <archuserau>	Same issue?
Jan 22 12:17:28 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Me I need to get the "system76 power" utility ported to fedora to make my life easier. If not fedora is unusable (Nouveau don't work and is loaded by default.. just to say that)
Jan 22 12:18:23 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should look into other user with your hardware using linux. Often what work for one distribution will work for you too
Jan 22 12:18:37 <archuserau>	I will have a look
Jan 22 12:19:53 <dfstorm>	archuserau: Blackboxed = Manifacturer include stuff (like your button) without any documentation and they won't give away their source code. They just give a "windows specific" driver that won't work on linux...
Jan 22 12:20:43 <dfstorm>	Most of manufacturers*
Jan 22 12:22:51 <dfstorm>	archuserau: You should try Archlinux if you know linux. Just boot the liveUSB then do the command I gave you
Jan 22 12:23:09 <dfstorm>	lspci -k | grep -A 2 -E "(VGA|3D)"
Jan 22 12:24:06 <dfstorm>	And if your Intel card shows up, then you know it's a fedora automation that make the problem (even if it probably help in most of usercase)
Jan 22 12:35:17 <archuserau>	It looks like the issue is the hardware switch only works in windows. I just booted into windows pressed the button and i am now in linux with intel graphics

Jan 22 14:41:06 <CPrompt^>	good morning.  I have been getting a lot of segmentation faults when running dnf update lately.
Jan 22 14:41:33 <CPrompt^>	has anyone else seen this?  Looking through the bug tracker, I can't find a newer report
Jan 22 14:48:33 <Khaytsus>	CPrompt^: Look for other segfaults..  segfaults indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:49:06 <Khaytsus>	Could also be if you have a VPS or something that's VERY low spec and it literally runs out of ram, but that's generally not a segfault.
Jan 22 14:51:54 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: ah...I didn't realie that running dnf and it returning a segfault would indicate HW problems.
Jan 22 14:51:57 <CPrompt^>	Thanks!
Jan 22 15:00:07 <Khaytsus>	Segfaults can be sw but most often they are hw..
Jan 22 15:17:43 <CPrompt^>	Khaytsus: thanks.  I will look through some logs and see if I see anything.  I did see in "messages" that there might be an issue with an external drive.

Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	Hello all, I've just moved to Fedora from Ubuntu migrating my home directory from the former to my Fedora installation. It looks like Nautilus is in some ways still using the Yaru dark theme but I can't seem to find the file / setting to change it. As it is only the file preview pane is black (with black text) and the selection in the sidebar is black instead of Adwaita blue. Gnome software has similiarly weird dark
Jan 22 16:12:57 <chasinglogic[m]>	color usages. I tried finding css files (nautilus.css, gtk.css) in my home dir that would create this problem but have had no luck. I've also tried changing and resetting the theme with Gnome Tweaks. Any further suggestions would be greatly appreciated
Jan 22 16:18:09 <prussian>	you might have to reset all your gconf settings.
Jan 22 16:18:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	chasinglogic[m], remove the files form your .config in your /home
Jan 22 16:18:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	control-h to view hidden folders
Jan 22 16:19:29 <prussian>	assuming you have checked the appropriate locations for theming and configuration, as pointed out above ^ ~/.config/gtk-3.0
Jan 22 16:25:16 <chasinglogic[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: Some deep dark file in .config was the problem, clearing nearly everything out of there worked
Jan 22 16:25:26 <chasinglogic[m]>	thanks both of you
Jan 22 16:28:34 <chasinglogic[m]>	Though it looks like Gnome Software still has the leftover dark theme in weird places
Jan 22 16:28:42 <chasinglogic[m]>	all of the tiles on the explore page
Jan 22 16:32:05 <chasinglogic[m]>	I am incorrect, logging out and back in fixed the gnome software issues as well
Jan 22 16:34:17 <prussian>	cool
Jan 22 16:34:19 <prussian>	good deal

Feb 19 14:24:50 <sohamg>	Hey im experiencing a bug(?) in F31 where i cannot lock the screen. The keyboard shortcut/panel button/timeout all result in the panel flashing which im assuming is a gnome shell crash. It used to trigger ARBT but now that i want to report it (im new to reporting etc) ARBT doesnt trigger. How would I get the logs/diagnostic info in this case?
Feb 19 14:26:31 <sohamg>	I think the 2nd to last update did this. Im on intel+nvidia/x11

Feb 28 21:58:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	lxde
Feb 28 21:58:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	i recommend no less than 50 for a Desktop environment
Feb 28 21:59:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	actually the smallest by live iso size is SOAS
Feb 28 22:02:32 <BlackMage>	50GB?!
Feb 28 22:02:51 <Khaytsus>	To use it as a normal daily system, yes
Feb 28 22:02:57 <Khaytsus>	For a random VM you
Feb 28 22:03:02 <Khaytsus>	you're not actively using, 20 is enough
Feb 28 22:14:13 <BlackMage>	only for building smaller programs, router firmware and trying out different things
Feb 28 22:14:57 <daniel-wtd>	BlackMage: it really depends on what you want to do. a minimal fedora installation with blackbox can be ~2GB disk space. Fedora Workstation recommends 20GB, which is sufficient for a small kiosk-like machine. If you want to have a ton of applications, photos, music, you have to count them in.
Feb 28 22:31:26 <BlackMage>	no, only a ton of libs required forbuilding
Feb 28 22:32:35 <BlackMage>	*for building
Feb 28 23:24:07 <BlackMage>	and lxde is the smallest gui?

Feb 29 15:53:55 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380 All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 16:12:51 <akik>	when installing a new kernel through dnf upgrade, the dkms stage takes too much cpu (the heat increases to the critical level) and crashes my laptop
Feb 29 16:13:00 <akik>	is there some way to limit that?
Feb 29 16:19:59 <Khaytsus>	akik: What is using dkms?  Most things on Fedora are akmod.  Plus....  how weak is your laptop that it can't compile a kernel module?
Feb 29 16:20:19 <akik>	Khaytsus: i have the wlan module installed through dkms
Feb 29 16:25:19 <avensurha>	akik: man cpupower-frequency-set
Feb 29 16:26:13 <fedbot>	*** F31-20200224 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2  Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins  ***
Feb 29 16:28:35 <akik>	avensurha: i need to install that. what do you mean by it?
Feb 29 16:29:14 <Khaytsus>	Maybe hit your fan with some pressurized air..  your laptop should never shut down because it's busy, especially not on a build which should take about 10s
Feb 29 16:34:10 <avensurha>	akik: you can limit your CPU frequency with it. it's part of kernel-tools package
Feb 29 16:35:06 <akik>	i'll try cpulimit as a first test if that'll work
Feb 29 16:35:26 <akik>	avensurha: do you mean changing the cpu governor?
Feb 29 16:35:58 <caterfxo>	akik: a google search returns suggestions like `cputool`, `cpulimit`
Feb 29 16:36:15 <avensurha>	akik: yes. and if i remember correctly, you can also set the max freq manually with it
Feb 29 16:41:26 <caterfxo>	possibly `renice`
Feb 29 16:46:36 <caterfxo>	`cool-retro-term`... probabably not so much
Feb 29 16:48:12 <Khaytsus>	I've never once had a machine that gets to any kind of 'critical temperature' doing anything.  that _screams_ something is wrong.
Feb 29 16:48:30 <Khaytsus>	Hot enough to throttle?  Perhaps, but not in the time it'd take to compile something small.
Feb 29 16:51:38 <akik>	Khaytsus: it's an old laptop. i have no high requirements for it
Feb 29 16:51:45 <ncuxo>	Hello I'm back ;D
Feb 29 16:51:58 <caterfxo>	me neither. maybe a stethescope would have revealed the laptop whispering, 'help me get hotter!'
Feb 29 16:52:29 <akik>	it run plasma 5 reqlly well though
Feb 29 16:52:34 <Khaytsus>	I'm guessing the fan is shot or clogged up.
Feb 29 16:52:44 <Khaytsus>	Hit it with some canned air, seriously
Feb 29 16:52:56 <ncuxo>	leden: I've reinstalled fedora and updated to 5.5.6 without an issue. I'm on 5.5.6 with the nvidia driver from the rpm fusion repo but there is a problem I have screen tear on my menu
Feb 29 16:53:35 <Khaytsus>	I had a laptop at work that kept getting jaggy on me, throttling.  I hit it with some canned air and it FILLED my office with dust.  I took it outside to hit it again, more plumes of dust.  No idea why it was so bad, office is not a dirty place.
Feb 29 16:53:41 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps because the laptop was eating it all
Feb 29 16:53:59 <Khaytsus>	After that no more jagginess..  it was actually able to keep cool
Feb 29 16:54:27 <ncuxo>	now I remember why I skipped this guide when I tryed to isntall nvidia before and moved to the nvidia xxx .run
Feb 29 16:54:51 <Khaytsus>	dnf install akmod-nvidia
Feb 29 16:54:52 <Khaytsus>	done
Feb 29 16:54:58 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: If you install the .run, you're on your own.
Feb 29 16:55:31 <short-bike>	Anyone else getting md5 mismatches on a DNF update - the 2 that dnf have failed on are 1) kernel-devel 5.5.6-201.fc31.x86_64.drpm and 2) selinux-policy-targeted-3.14.4-49.fc31.noarch.drpm: ? I have already run dnf clean all and re-tried the update. Same errors appear.
Feb 29 16:55:33 <ncuxo>	oh I couldn't upgrade from 5.4.19 thus I was recommended to reinstall :D
Feb 29 16:55:50 <jell48>	hi, im getting error from "curl https://google.com -v" in chrooted environment "* Unable to initialize NSS database"..."curl: (77) Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)", the db files exist in /etc/pki/nssdb/ directory. is there a way to find out which lib or component is missing?

Feb 29 16:56:35 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: very true. Will sleep the update for 30 mins. Thank you bud.
Feb 29 16:56:36 <avensurha>	Khaytsus: @nvidia .run
Feb 29 16:57:55 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: When I see that, it's typically short lived..  might go away on dnf clean all, may not.  Rarely have I seen it actually bug me beyond just trying to do an update, although I generally just dnf update nightly so I never do it manually
Feb 29 16:58:39 <akik>	ok cpulimit -i -l 50 worked. i see "make -j4" in the output
Feb 29 16:58:59 <short-bike>	Khaytsus: makes sense - but this is a fairly new install so updates are manually triggered ATM.
Feb 29 16:58:59 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: https://paste.centos.org/view/efeece9b
Feb 29 16:59:27 <Khaytsus>	short-bike: gotcha.  Yeah try clean all, if it fails, clean all again..  i think each time it'll generally wind up on a different mirror heh
Feb 29 16:59:37 <Uniaika>	hello
Feb 29 17:00:15 <Khaytsus>	libwebsockets has been failing me for a long time though, I just ran dnf update here for giggles to see if I was seeing any issues.
Feb 29 17:00:17 <Uniaika>	Since upgrading today, a couple of binaries on my system crash with the infamous "*** stack smashing detected ***: <unknown> terminated"
Feb 29 17:00:35 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Updating how?
Feb 29 17:00:41 <Uniaika>	sudo dnf upgrade -y
Feb 29 17:00:43 <Uniaika>	nothing fancy
Feb 29 17:01:13 <Uniaika>	but the crashing binaries don't come from the Fedora repos.
Feb 29 17:01:22 <Khaytsus>	k...
Feb 29 17:01:29 <Khaytsus>	So...  they're broken?
Feb 29 17:01:33 <Uniaika>	(more precisely, they are `nix` utilities and the haskell `stack` tool)
Feb 29 17:01:55 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: up until yesterday everything worked perfectly
Feb 29 17:02:05 <Uniaika>	has there been any ABI change as of recently?
Feb 29 17:02:21 <Uniaika>	I am not a C programmer, so I have no bloody idea about the root cause of all this
Feb 29 17:03:29 <short-bike>	Uniaika: point release update of version upgrade (ie 30 -> 31 etc) ?
Feb 29 17:03:41 <short-bike>	s/of/or*
Feb 29 17:03:47 <Khaytsus>	Sounds like he just did a normal package update, not a distro update
Feb 29 17:03:51 <Uniaika>	nope, still running 30
Feb 29 17:04:04 <Khaytsus>	30lyfe..  I really need to udpate myself
Feb 29 17:04:14 <Khaytsus>	51 days, 21 hours, 55 minutes, 46 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Feb 29 17:04:46 <Uniaika>	should I maybe upgrade to 31?
Feb 29 17:04:58 <Khaytsus>	I doubt that'd fix your specific issue
Feb 29 17:05:20 <Uniaika>	I'm going to reinstall them manually
Feb 29 17:05:22 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: No idea about haskell, I know Fedora ships it, but I assume not the 'stack' util you mentioned?
Feb 29 17:05:28 <short-bike>	Uniaika: can we se either sysinfo or dnf repolist on a paste first please.
Feb 29 17:06:27 <Uniaika>	short-bike: of course, I'm getting you that
Feb 29 17:09:26 <ncuxo>	Khaytsus: I already have this package installed and I still have the screen tear so I don't think the problem comes from there
Feb 29 17:10:24 <Khaytsus>	ncuxo: I see minor screen tears here sometimes too, not like it's a big deal
Feb 29 17:11:10 <Uniaika>	short-bike: when you mean "sysinfo", is there a specific packet that provides that command?
Feb 29 17:11:28 <Uniaika>	anyway, here is my repolist https://hastebin.com/zotawutebe.coffeescript
Feb 29 17:11:56 <leden>	ncuxo, can you give us  ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ | fpaste
Feb 29 17:12:11 <short-bike>	Uniaika: fpaste --sysinfo (will generate a URL for posting in here) :)
Feb 29 17:14:23 <Uniaika>	short-bike: here it is! https://paste.centos.org/view/587f7d69
Feb 29 17:14:38 <ncuxo>	leden: https://paste.centos.org/view/efc3656d https://paste.centos.org/view/39e54984
Feb 29 17:14:51 <ncuxo>	first is the dir and the second is the content of the file
Feb 29 17:15:20 <short-bike>	Uniaika: my rationale for that is to see if there are any repo's in there that need to be disabled prior to you going to f31. But I can see from your first paste that there are.
Feb 29 17:15:30 *	short-bike looks at sysinfo 
Feb 29 17:16:22 <Uniaika>	(fun fact, reinstalling `stack` made it work again)
Feb 29 17:16:53 <Khaytsus>	Uniaika: Perhaps it got an update?  No idea.
Feb 29 17:18:41 <Uniaika>	Khaytsus: I tried to update it from its own updater, and it told me I was already at the latest version :/
Feb 29 17:25:05 <ncuxo>	leden: should I have more files there ?
Feb 29 17:26:00 <leden>	ncuxo, can you make  like 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf and cat paste --> https://paste.centos.org/view/51d1d8af
Feb 29 17:26:50 <leden>	ncuxo, save it and reboot system
Feb 29 17:27:05 <akik>	Khaytsus: the idle temperature on this laptop is about 49 C. the critical temperature which was reached was 88 C :P
Feb 29 17:27:49 <akik>	i'll try that air cleaning some day soon
Feb 29 17:38:45 <ncuxo>	leden: I still have the screen tear
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	Hello everyone, I have a strange issue, when I'm going into suspend or hibernate mode and then awake the computer, black screen shows up and the computer hangs, the only thing I could to it's restart, so far not relevant information from journalctl, my machine: fedora31 gnome kernel: Linux APC 5.5.5-200.fc31.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Feb 19 23:28:07 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux Graphic card: AMD R9 380
Feb 29 17:46:32 <Kokpit>	All system is updated with sudo dnf update
Feb 29 17:48:27 <ncuxo>	5.5.6 is out so its not up to date
Feb 29 17:54:54 <leden>	ncuxo, can you run 'nvidia-settings' in terminal
Feb 29 17:56:28 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b1d7d1e8
Feb 29 17:56:44 <ncuxo>	leden: I did run it but the nvidia driver is not loaded
Feb 29 17:57:02 <ncuxo>	I guess by default the nouveau driver is loaded
Feb 29 17:57:19 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:19 <ncuxo>	should I blacklist it?
Feb 29 17:57:24 <leden>	ncuxo, yes
Feb 29 17:57:29 <kwizart>	leden, NO!
Feb 29 17:57:50 <leden>	kwizart, ol
Feb 29 17:57:50 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you should follow guides: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Feb 29 17:58:05 <ncuxo>	kwizart: this is what I did
Feb 29 17:58:19 <ncuxo>	I started with another guide and leden gave me this one
Feb 29 17:58:32 <ncuxo>	so I reinstalled fedora and used the rpmfusion one
Feb 29 17:58:49 <kwizart>	ncuxo, please verify to have kernel-devel matching your kernel and let it build the nvidia kmod
Feb 29 17:59:24 <kwizart>	ncuxo, if you have nouveau still loaded, please don't manually blacklist it, please reboot a second time eventually
Feb 29 17:59:33 <kwizart>	ncuxo, and verify to have secure boot disabled
Feb 29 18:00:26 <ncuxo>	kwizart: isn't secure boot only on EFI?
Feb 29 18:00:37 <kwizart>	yes, it is
Feb 29 18:00:59 <ncuxo>	kwizart: I just rebooted and still nouveau is loaded
Feb 29 18:01:20 <ncuxo>	the kernel-devel and the kernel are the same version
Feb 29 18:01:23 <kwizart>	ncuxo, then paste the archive created by nvidia-bug-report.sh
Feb 29 18:01:42 <kwizart>	ncuxo, does modinfo nvidia output something ?
Feb 29 18:01:45 <ncuxo>	where is this located ?
Feb 29 18:01:56 <kwizart>	ncuxo, in your PATH
Feb 29 18:02:02 <ncuxo>	yes module nvidia not found
Feb 29 18:02:13 <kwizart>	ncuxo, try with akmods --force
Feb 29 18:03:12 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/0c748833
Feb 29 18:03:21 <ncuxo>	here is the nvidia bug report
Feb 29 18:03:55 <kwizart>	ncuxo, not really, zcat nvidia-bug-report.log.gz |fpaste
Feb 29 18:04:36 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/2a1cc05d
Feb 29 18:06:23 <ncuxo>	this is for akmods --force https://paste.centos.org/view/1ce39375
Feb 29 18:06:28 <ncuxo>	it was unable to build
Feb 29 18:07:58 <kwizart>	ncuxo, why are you using nvidia-390 driver ?
Feb 29 18:08:57 <ncuxo>	because this is what my card needs
Feb 29 18:09:28 <kwizart>	ncuxo, well, indeed, this is the right ones
Feb 29 18:09:32 <ncuxo>	its a legacy GeForce 400 card
Feb 29 18:09:59 <ncuxo>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b33e60bd this is the akmods --force logs
Feb 29 18:10:02 <kwizart>	ncuxo, so we end-up having issue with 5.5.x kernel apparently and we are seeking for maintainers
Feb 29 18:10:36 <kwizart>	ncuxo, you might have better luck with the kernel-longterm-5.4 that I'm building
Feb 29 18:10:44 <kwizart>	ncuxo, https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kwizart/kernel-longterm-5.4/
Feb 29 18:11:14 <ncuxo>	oh with 5.4 I was fine
Feb 29 18:11:24 <ncuxo>	I was using it before I started to move to 5.5

Feb 29 22:06:24 <janos_>	oh hadn't seen that one. looking

Mar 02 12:40:31 <BlackMage>	is no partition manager in lxde-live included?
Mar 02 12:45:00 <p3lim>	Hey, is there something like du that lets me check disk space per directory, but on a specific disk? du shows directory space usage on all disks
Mar 02 12:46:26 <rru04>	du shows space usage of directories
Mar 02 12:46:50 <BlackMage>	specify the directory as argument
Mar 02 12:47:15 <FranciscoD>	BlackMage: you can install stuff on the live image, including a partition manager.
Mar 02 12:47:30 <FranciscoD>	Otherwise, when you want to install from the live, anaconda includes one
Mar 02 12:47:36 <p3lim>	I have 20 disks in the system, but the sysroot disk  is close to full, need to find out _on that disk_ what's taking up space, but it's showing disk space from _all 20 disks_
Mar 02 12:48:04 <p3lim>	specifying the directory doesn't help
Mar 02 12:48:08 <FranciscoD>	p3lim: `du <path to where whatever disk is mounted>`
Mar 02 12:48:19 <FranciscoD>	are you running it in /?
Mar 02 12:48:25 <p3lim>	yes
Mar 02 12:48:42 <FranciscoD>	`du <path>` works just fine here
Mar 02 12:48:47 <FranciscoD>	that's also what the man page says
Mar 02 12:48:48 <rru04>	p3lim: like that du -sh /usr/local
Mar 02 12:48:54 <FranciscoD>	where is the sysroot mounted?
Mar 02 12:49:01 <p3lim>	on /
Mar 02 12:49:22 <FranciscoD>	so then it's showing you the right output
Mar 02 12:49:33 <FranciscoD>	du does not do disks, it does folders/directories
Mar 02 12:49:50 <FranciscoD>	since all your disks are also mounted in /, it also looks at them
Mar 02 12:50:07 <FranciscoD>	manually specify what directories you want it to look at
Mar 02 12:50:14 <p3lim>	which is why I'm asking for something _like_ du but that takes disks into account
Mar 02 12:50:37 <FranciscoD>	not heard of anything that does that, sorry
Mar 02 12:51:04 <FranciscoD>	either you get disk overviews with df
Mar 02 12:51:11 <FranciscoD>	or you get directory data with du
Mar 02 12:51:34 <FranciscoD>	check their man pages, maybe they have advanced options
Mar 02 12:52:50 <rru04>	well df checks filesystems usage and on which device (disk)
Mar 02 12:54:28 <rru04>	as you know which filesystem is running out of space you will identify which directory contains too much of data
Mar 02 12:57:21 <BlackMage>	ok, after i resized the pv with kparititionmanager the system dont boot
Mar 02 12:57:22 <cberg>	p3lim: du -hcx -d 1 /
Mar 02 12:57:31 <cberg>	-x means don't traverse filesystems
Mar 02 12:58:47 <p3lim>	cberg: thanks!
Mar 02 12:58:49 <cberg>	and to sort it: du -hcx -d 1 / | sort -h
Mar 02 12:58:57 <rru04>	p3lim: find . -type d -print0 | xargs -0 -I REPL bash -c "du -s 'REPL'" | sort -g
Mar 02 12:59:47 <rru04>	with this command you will find how much data is in every directory and also it will sort them
Mar 02 13:00:38 <damo22>	or just use ncdu
Mar 02 14:55:06 <rexwin>	I donot want graphics in fedora . how to change the default runlevel to 3?
Mar 02 14:56:01 <der_Alte>	you can't because there are no runlevels anymore ... however you can set multi-user.target to be the default systemd target
Mar 02 14:56:10 <Khaytsus>	systemctl set-default multi-user.target
Mar 02 14:56:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	rexwin take a look at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SysVinit_to_Systemd_Cheatsheet

Mar 02 16:09:45 <FixPleaseTo>	I suffer, because Netflix doesn't play.  is somebody helping with this?  the service error code today is M7355. I'm running the l8est fedora with proprietary nvidia drivers to use chromium.  I have rpm fusion free and nonfree enabled
Mar 02 16:11:24 <linuxmodder>	iirc that is flash player related but should be minimal issue if at all on chrom*   it's more pronounced on firefox
Mar 02 16:14:32 <Khaytsus>	Netflix works perfectly fine on Chrome.
Mar 02 16:15:29 <FixPleaseTo>	my heart says go with chromium, buuuut it seems that it's going to be an option that's closed
Mar 02 16:16:00 <FixPleaseTo>	there is some "freeworld" flavor of chromium listed as well, but that only gives a partial functionality (previews play, but an actual show stream won't).  it also knocks the version (of chromium) down 2 numbers, and seemingly introduces a scary red icon on top relating to "sync", which I don't think I'll be using anyway
Mar 02 16:20:02 <karroffel>	Netflix works fine for me on Firefox
Mar 02 16:20:32 <karroffel>	You need to enable the DRM feature, but that was all that I had to do
Mar 02 16:22:24 <janos_>	fine here with firefox. never tried it before. just did, no problem
Mar 02 16:25:58 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, chromium-freeworld (or even fedora chromium) isn't allowed to distribute the DRM components netflix relies on
Mar 02 16:26:04 <storrgie>	I'm wondering if anyone has gone through the dnf update process (between say 30->31) with ZFS on their system (not ZFS root, but having attached ZFS pools)
Mar 02 16:26:16 <storrgie>	I'm thinking of moving from debian to fedora server and this is my one worry
Mar 02 16:26:29 <kwizart>	FixPleaseTo, https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-chromium-or-google-chrome-browsers/
Mar 02 16:27:07 <FixPleaseTo>	ty lots, it's tgreat having options. thanks! this is bound to set me up now

Mar 18 14:09:57 <ufo>	so i want to uninstall geoclue2, and it looks like webkit2gtk3 depends on it for some reason
Mar 18 14:10:21 <Khaytsus>	Why would you need to remove it?
Mar 18 14:10:36 <ufo>	which looks like is on my system because of "yelp" browser, which i don't use...  but when i try to uninstall that it says anaconda depends on it
Mar 18 14:10:58 <ufo>	i don't want geo stuff at all
Mar 18 14:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	so why did you install the yelp browser
Mar 18 14:11:24 <ufo>	i didn't
Mar 18 14:11:45 <Khaytsus>	yhelp is gnome's help browser.. it's not a 'web' browser
Mar 18 14:11:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes you did yelp.x86_64 : Help browser for the GNOME desktop
Mar 18 14:11:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	ou installed gnome
Mar 18 14:12:02 <ufo>	i'm not sure why it would have been installed by default in the xfce spin
Mar 18 14:12:08 <Khaytsus>	I did not install Gnome; yelp is installed here
Mar 18 14:12:32 <Khaytsus>	I suspect it's bundled into some of the gnome stuff that is in every spin
Mar 18 14:12:55 <Khaytsus>	ufo: Obessing over individual packages is an interesting hobby but unlikely a productive one.
Mar 18 14:13:55 <ufo>	thanks

Mar 18 15:58:39 <Khaytsus>	God I hate matrix.
Mar 18 16:15:28 <Bayesian_Coffee>	having trouble with the internal mic on F31, on a ThinkPad T490. found this bug and comment: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1772498#c223
Mar 18 16:15:47 <Bayesian_Coffee>	how do i get this pulseaudio-13.99.1-1.fc31.x86_64 package though?
Mar 18 16:15:56 <Bayesian_Coffee>	when i try to upgrade, i'm not seeing it in any repos i have
Mar 18 16:22:37 <kwizart>	Bayesian_Coffee, dnf update --enablerepo=updates-testing pulseaudio\*
Mar 18 16:24:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	ah, got it. will try that, thanks
Mar 18 16:31:30 <Bayesian_Coffee>	thanks! that worked perfectly
Mar 18 16:32:06 <Bayesian_Coffee>	so, newbie q: given that they closed that bug and filed a new one for F32, what do the update schedules look like for F31 from now on? is stuff not going to get patched in 31?
Mar 18 16:32:37 <Bayesian_Coffee>	like is that newer version of pulseaudio not going go make it into F31 outside of the testing repo?
Mar 18 16:34:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	Bayesian_Coffee, it looks like it is set tonight or tomorrow morning https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=pulseaudio
Mar 18 16:34:23 <Bayesian_Coffee>	oh, cool.
Mar 18 16:34:55 <Bayesian_Coffee>	of course right when i start to WFH from COVID-19, to get on a Google Hangout my mic is out...
Mar 18 16:35:11 <Bayesian_Coffee>	but yeah, working perfectly now
Mar 18 16:44:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, https://imagebin.ca/v/5G3PKDX5bVc7
Mar 18 16:54:31 <idlemind>	so something recent has definitely sped up my vp9 encoding, that's a welcome change. went from ~ 24 h for a 480p full length movie to 5 h. nice
Mar 18 16:59:09 <nerdwoman>	Hey everybody, running fedora with xfce on my laptop here. Had to start doing video chatting for work and using hte camera at all uses 200%+ of the cpu, sitting around a load of 8 with 4 cores. I don't suppose there might be better drivers out there, that would help with this?
Mar 18 17:00:04 <nerdwoman>	... I've never troubleshot a webcam before, just audio drivers back in the day
Mar 18 17:02:01 <sbroz>	is it unexpected that realtime video encoding uses a lot of cpu?
Mar 18 17:02:39 <idlemind>	it shouldn't kill the cpu though, how is your performance with something like cheese
Mar 18 17:02:49 <idlemind>	might just be codec related
Mar 18 17:03:18 <idlemind>	(xfce likely won't have cheese, it has a flatpak though if you don't want to pull in a lot of rpms)
Mar 18 17:03:36 <dowdle>	idlemind: If you think that is slow, you should try av1 encoding. :)  It is measured in minutes per frame.
Mar 18 17:04:11 <idlemind>	dowdle ya for me a faster encode is kind of just a nice to have, i don't really have any deadlines. just slowly digitizing dvds
Mar 18 17:04:18 <dowdle>	idlemind: I tried encoding a movie and it was halfway done after about 2.5 weeks. :)
Mar 18 17:04:20 <idlemind>	just impressed in a 24 hr to 5 hr drop
Mar 18 17:04:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	sbroz, no its not unexpected
Mar 18 17:04:54 <sbroz>	Southern_Gentlem: indeed
Mar 18 17:05:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	idlemind, but to me i rather use the cheese in the repos than flatpak
Mar 18 17:06:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	it will definitely makes upgrades down the road easier with the repo packages
Mar 18 17:09:04 <ForlornWongraven>	flatpak is really nice to check something
Mar 18 17:09:13 <ForlornWongraven>	over time repos are much better
Mar 18 17:11:26 <idlemind>	ya, it's also nice from a dev perspective to hit a wide target without a lot of effort

Mar 18 22:40:04 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: since the source code is available I may think of starting packaging it
Mar 18 22:40:12 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see this for EL7 - https://github.com/Rupan/mprime
Mar 18 22:41:51 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: very interesting
Mar 18 22:42:02 <Caterpillar>	I wonder why this guy never putted those specs in fedora repo
Mar 18 22:42:08 <Caterpillar>	and / EPEL
Mar 18 22:43:29 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Well, while the source code is available they have quite a few licensing terms... and a skim of those makes it appear they claim to own all data... so maybe it isn't free software?!?
Mar 18 22:45:30 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: maybe, I had not seen the license yet
Mar 18 22:46:28 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: I see quite a few web references to use mprime as a system stress test... and every reference I've seen refers to the links provided by the software provider's website and not any packages from distros.
Mar 18 22:47:21 <dowdle>	Caterpillar: Doesn't look like Debian packages it.
Mar 18 22:50:14 <Caterpillar>	dowdle: yes, the license page is a bit........wird

Mar 19 10:54:36 <andy|>	anyone else on f32 having problems with sound output and bluetooth headset?
Mar 19 11:31:51 <bern>	hi, I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 11:51:33 <BinaryAura>	I'm trying to install Nvidia drivers but after I disabled nouveau my monitors no longer are receiving input and my motherboard is not giving any signs of error. Any advice?
Mar 19 11:53:33 <kwizart>	BinaryAura, you shoudn't touch any low level driver, but rely on using packaged driver as this is way easier even for advanced users
Mar 19 11:54:11 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: rpmfusion has the nvidia driver packaged for Fedora. You only need to install the packages and that's it, it  takes care of the rest including disabling nouveau.
Mar 19 11:56:27 <[Enrico]>	BinaryAura: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:42 <ratskin>	BinaryAura: RPMFusion's HowTo includes instructions for recovering from any mess that might be left by using Nvidia's installer: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA
Mar 19 11:56:50 <ratskin>	Snap :)
Mar 19 11:56:55 <[Enrico]>	as easy as it can get with Nvidia on Linux
Mar 19 11:57:11 <[Enrico]>	still definitely not as easy as with Intel and AMD
Mar 19 11:57:48 <BinaryAura>	I had two GPU cards installed I switched which one I was using and the monitor came up. This is weird because both cards were working before

Mar 19 14:21:28 <Sheogorath[m]>	oDiafanos: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-apache-http-server/ <-- this should get your through the basics :)
Mar 19 14:30:24 <oDiafanos>	thanks but this site doesnt include vhost multiple site configuration
Mar 19 14:31:52 <Khaytsus>	oDiafanos: #httpd
Mar 19 14:32:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  google does
Mar 19 14:32:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	basicly you can do one you can do many
Mar 19 14:32:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	(Directory) (/Directory)
Mar 19 14:33:23 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: What do you need to know?
Mar 19 14:34:32 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if I make an index file in /var/www/html everything works (no welcome page)
Mar 19 14:35:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Mar 19 14:35:19 <vdamewood>	That's normal.
Mar 19 14:35:24 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: if i make a "Second site" in /var/www/html/docs/index with the appropriate "vhost" file
Mar 19 14:35:41 <vdamewood>	What's a "vhost" file?
Mar 19 14:36:08 <oDiafanos>	a conf file in /etc/httpd/conf.d
Mar 19 14:38:06 <oDiafanos>	to send my browser request throught a test domain to a specific httpd folder
Mar 19 14:38:06 <vdamewood>	I se an "if", but no follow up "then"
Mar 19 14:38:09 <vdamewood>	s/se/see/
Mar 19 14:39:56 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: ? :P
Mar 19 14:40:36 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, it's rather impossible to figure out what's going on until you complete your thought.
Mar 19 14:41:09 <oDiafanos>	ok so : index file in /www/html folder works normaly
Mar 19 14:42:03 <oDiafanos>	second index in /www/html/docs/index WITH conf file with test domain dont work
Mar 19 14:42:41 <oDiafanos>	in second example welcome page appears in all test domains
Mar 19 14:45:05 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: 1: You should probably put web spaces in different directories, and not have one as a child of the other. 2: What's the name of your conf file with the virtual host information? 3: fpaste your vhost config file.
Mar 19 14:45:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos, <Directory /www/html/test>   </Directory>
Mar 19 14:47:07 <vdamewood>	Oh, I just noticed it's /www and not /var/www. So, yeah <Directory ...>, but also, did you do either of changing the selinux context on the /www directory, or disable selinux?
Mar 19 14:50:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	vdamewood, also depends on their document root statement above that
Mar 19 14:50:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	mine says /srv/www/html
Mar 19 14:51:23 <oDiafanos>	vdamewood: it all in  /var/www/html , i just skipped writing /var but its correct in my configuration
Mar 19 14:51:45 <vdamewood>	I think my production system doesn't even have a Document Root outside of a vhost.
Mar 19 14:52:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  so make a subdirectory for each host under that
Mar 19 14:53:59 <oDiafanos>	Southern_Gentlem: i'll try that now + <Directory ...>  + disable se
Mar 19 14:56:03 <vdamewood>	Actually, if you're in /var/www, you won't have to mess with SE. if you want to put your docs somewhere else, it's not hard to change the context.
Mar 19 14:59:22 <oDiafanos>	i'm in /var/www/html/ as httpd.conf uses it for root folder
Mar 19 15:01:15 <oDiafanos>	fedora 31 server , default httpd installation
Mar 19 15:02:44 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: Well, what about 2 and 3 that I mentioned above?
Mar 19 15:05:22 <oDiafanos>	2. docs.conf 3. https://pastebin.com/yQ4JGE11
Mar 19 15:07:39 <oDiafanos>	diferent directories is the solution
Mar 19 15:08:37 <vdamewood>	oDiafanos: So, you fixed it?
Mar 19 15:08:39 <oDiafanos>	i just made 3 test sites in subfolders and they work
Mar 19 15:08:42 <oDiafanos>	yes
Mar 19 15:08:55 <oDiafanos>	well... i learned how it works :P
Mar 19 15:09:20 <oDiafanos>	thank you for explaining
Mar 19 15:09:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	oDiafanos,  like i said if the first one works its easy to cut and paste for the rest

Mar 19 16:18:16 <dbristow>	Southern_Gentlem: So you were right, it is taking a while to finish seeding 32_Beta Labs x86_64
Mar 19 16:19:37 <dbristow>	Astronomy_KDE and Design_suite finished but the rest are mostly 0kB/s
Mar 19 16:26:10 <devid>	why is the weather in my gnome panel showing as the first entry, time 01:00 with value "--" ?
Mar 19 16:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	dbristow, now that i turn them off they should come up
Mar 19 16:32:04 <Khaytsus>	I've never seeded those, honestly..  just the base spins.  It've send up 16G for KDE, 15G for Mate, 8G for XFCE, 4G for LXDE, 5G for LXQT, 13G for Cinnamon, 40G for Workstation
Mar 19 16:35:16 <dbristow>	Khaytsus: I may do that for 32 actual.
Mar 19 16:35:22 <dbristow>	Normally I don't torrent betas.
Mar 19 16:35:48 <Khaytsus>	I usually seed beta and release
Mar 19 17:01:56 <linux_user>	Subscription-manager is a paid service no? Why is Fedora telling me I need to pay for it to have updates?
Mar 19 17:02:13 <linux_user>	or why is Fedora saying I need to use subscription manager?
Mar 19 17:02:35 <sbroz>	linux_user: where? are you sure you're actually on fedora?
Mar 19 17:02:59 <Sheogorath[m]>	linux_user: Where does it say this?

Mar 19 17:03:45 <Venemo>	hey guys. does RPM Fusion work with Fedora 32 yet?
Mar 19 17:04:17 *	fedbot removes quiet on *!*@71.38.204.217
Mar 19 17:04:47 <linux_user>	https://pastebin.com/YBVs50xV
Mar 19 17:05:39 <Khaytsus>	Venemo: rpmfusion is not typically something that you use when testing Fedora.
Mar 19 17:05:52 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: You installed that, so..
Mar 19 17:06:05 <linux_user>	huh? I never install subscription-manager!
Mar 19 17:06:07 <linux_user>	that is a lie
Mar 19 17:06:54 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 17:08:10 <Venemo>	Khaytsus: I respectfully disagree, it usually is. AFAIK usually rpmfusion rawhide is usable on the latest fedora beta, at least that's my past experience

Mar 19 17:10:39 <Khaytsus>	linux_user: Perhaps you use Cockpit?  Apparently it's easily enabled from there, leading to this.  Fedora does not install that package by default.
Mar 19 17:11:36 <linux_user>	I do use Cockpit yet
Mar 19 17:11:44 <linux_user>	all I did was do a system update with it.
Mar 19 17:11:49 <linux_user>	let me look at cockpit
Mar 19 17:11:55 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps you enabled the subscription stuff from there.  Anyway, just remove suscription-manager
Mar 19 17:13:50 <linux_user>	hmm....ok, I see that in Applications now! very odd, as I don't remember doing that - however, I did remove it and am rebooting
Mar 19 17:14:07 <linux_user>	I know subscription-manager is for paid support, so I would not know why I'd have ever enabled it!
Mar 19 17:14:31 <Khaytsus>	nor do we
Mar 19 17:15:21 <linux_user>	I will surely need to be more careful about noticing if that is enabled on Fedora systems I work with in the future as well.
Mar 19 17:15:34 <Khaytsus>	It will not be unless you do it.
Mar 19 17:21:27 <linux_user>	I also un-installed subscription-manager
Mar 19 17:22:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	subscription manager got added to fedora for some reason back in f30 iirc
Mar 19 17:23:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	live would not build without it for some reason which was later fixed
Mar 19 17:34:03 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: He's making claims that it installed itself, however, which is not true.  the package itself as part of Fedora, not sure
Mar 19 17:44:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so if he installed f30 then dnf upgraded it would still be on his machine
Mar 19 18:05:30 <bern>	apologies for reposting, but I've not been able to find an answer to this online.
Mar 19 18:05:39 <bern>	I'm looking to refine the ciphers for ssh, SSL and the like. https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/f31/release-notes/sysadmin/Security/#custom-crypto-policies says "add a simple configuration file and execute the update-crypto-policies command". Sounds lovely. Where do I put the file?
Mar 19 18:09:45 <moowhool>	Hello everyone. Is it the right place to suggest changes to the `dnf` package manager ?
Mar 19 18:12:35 <FranciscoD>	moowhool: #yum, github, their mailing list
Mar 19 18:13:18 <moowhool>	FrancsisoD: Thank you very much
Mar 19 18:22:15 <plundra>	bern: /etc/crypto-policies/config
Mar 19 18:22:40 <plundra>	bern: Read the man-page of update-crypto-policies
Mar 19 18:24:56 <cberg>	the 'verfiy' link on https://alt.fedoraproject.org/ for the netinstall (aka everything) doesn't work (404)
Mar 19 18:27:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg which netinstall
Mar 19 18:27:59 <bern>	plundra: thanks, looks like it's actually /etc/crypto-policies/local.d, but your pointer helped me find that
Mar 19 18:28:04 <cberg>	Southern_Gentlem: the one on that page under "Everything" (I suppose that's the official name for the netinst now)
Mar 19 18:28:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg, not all mirrors carry the beta
Mar 19 18:28:22 <cberg>	that's still F31
Mar 19 18:28:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	give me the full link

Mar 19 18:31:15 <Acru>	Hey, I am currently having a problem with Fedora 31 on a Lenovo W520, up until yesterday my integrated webcam worked without problems, but when trying to use it again today, it does not work at all, so it does not seem to transmit any pictures (e.g. chees is just black and the buttons are greyed out)
Mar 19 18:31:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	try http://mirror.cc.vt.edu/pub/fedora/linux/releases/31/Everything/x86_64/iso/
Mar 19 18:31:47 <cberg>	that does have the Checksum file, thanks Southern_Gentlem
Mar 19 18:31:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, so what changed from yesterday to today
Mar 19 18:31:59 <Acru>	I did some updates
Mar 19 18:32:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so what have tested
Mar 19 18:32:26 <Acru>	Sorry?
Mar 19 18:32:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	you did some updates so that must of caused the issue
Mar 19 18:33:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	what have you tested out of those updates
Mar 19 18:33:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Mar 19 18:34:17 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/56ce6034
Mar 19 18:34:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	cberg,  and there are the updated isos in the topic (and the Respins Sig is testing a new batch at the moment
Mar 19 18:35:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru,  first thing i would try would be booting into your older kernel
Mar 19 18:35:54 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem I already tried that, but it did not fix the isue
Mar 19 18:38:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	Acru dnf history |fpaste
Mar 19 18:38:46 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem https://paste.centos.org/view/501a04f9
Mar 19 18:39:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	start looking at dnf history info 344 and work yourway back to the top
Mar 19 18:41:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	also i disagree with ever using the -y switch you need to see where stuff is being installed from
Mar 19 18:41:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	especially when you have so many third party repos
Mar 19 18:42:58 <Acru>	Southern_Gentlem any further info what that might mean? `Failed to try-restart pesign.service: Unit pesign.service not found.`
Mar 19 18:44:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	not out the top of my head
Mar 19 18:44:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	so look through your journalctl and see if you see anymore errors

Mar 20 10:23:42 <tete_>	hi, i am facing a problem with my soundcard (creative soundblaster xae-5 or so...). the profile which is used as default in pavu control is wrong. everytime i reboot my machine, it is set to digital input/output, but that is wrong, it is analog surround 5.1 + analog stereo input. can someone tell me how to fix that?
Mar 20 10:23:52 <tete_>	its so annoying
Mar 20 11:30:07 <daniel-wtd>	Hi all, I am having a monitor connected via usb-c. It also provides a usb hub, which connects stuff like keyboard, mouse. The issue ist, that everytime the notebook goes to "blank screen", the whole monitor is disconnected and therefore all peripherals, too. Do you see any option (aside disabling screen lock) to address this?

Mar 20 15:50:21 <corshmock>	Hi all
Mar 20 15:51:00 <corshmock>	I'm trying to install OneDrive from this link but getting error.  https://fedora.pkgs.org/31/fedora-updates-x86_64/onedrive-2.3.12-1.fc31.x86_64.rpm.html
Mar 20 15:51:23 <corshmock>	Has anyone successfully install OneDrive on Fedora Workstation 31?  Newbie here
Mar 20 15:51:32 <kwizart>	corshmock, why not use it from the repository; dnf install onedrive
Mar 20 15:52:12 <corshmock>	kwizart: that's exactly what I did, but I got an error (can post pastebin) but it doesn't appear to have installed.
Mar 20 15:53:07 <kwizart>	corshmock,  sudo dnf install onedrive | paste
Mar 20 15:54:55 <corshmock>	I'll try that thank kwizart
Mar 20 15:57:01 <corshmock>	https://paste.centos.org/view/f37e830c
Mar 20 15:57:18 <corshmock>	It asks for a response url ??
Mar 20 16:03:29 <kwizart>	corshmock, it's already installed. now I cannot help with using onedrive, I guess you need to use it from an associated account in the desktop environnement
Mar 20 16:04:01 <kwizart>	corshmock, in gnome, there is the oneline account application that might help to configure the microsoft account to be used with onedrive and others applications...
Mar 20 16:06:27 <corshmock>	oneline kwizart ?  Can't find any such thing.  I'm logged into onedrive in firefox but when I paste that url in, it says Could not initialize the OneDrive API
Mar 20 16:08:56 <Khaytsus>	https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive  has usage info
Mar 20 16:13:51 <launchpadmcquak>	does anybody know how to reference a local path (not http) repo properly in mock?  mock in fedora 31 appears to ignore file:/// repos outright
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	was lead to here in my googling: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki/Plugin-BindMount
Mar 20 16:14:54 <launchpadmcquak>	but I'm not sure what the destination mountpoint should be such that dnf will see it and pull the repodata from it... anybody else stumped by this?
Mar 20 16:15:05 *	mock never ignores files or repos
Mar 20 16:15:33 <Egyptian>	hi - so .. due to work load - i upgraded my work laptop's bios about 10 days ago and finally rebooted today. and now the "windows-like" screen says my disk is corrupt. how do i tell uefi to use the linux partition instead ? and i do not have windows on this machine. this must be the "repair" partition or something
Mar 20 16:15:37 <launchpadmcquak>	seems like it does in recent versions: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/mock/wiki#using-file-urls-in-configs
Mar 20 16:16:25 <launchpadmcquak>	Egyptian: check your boot order, sometimes after a BIOS update UEFI will throw "Windows Boot Manager" back to the top of the list
Mar 20 16:16:42 <corshmock>	kwizart: I think it's working
Mar 20 16:17:12 <launchpadmcquak>	if this is the wrong room for this mock problem, would someone point me to the right room?
Mar 20 16:17:14 <corshmock>	I entered onedrive --monitor and it started downloading everything from my OneDrive.  Thanks very much for you r help
Mar 20 16:19:05 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You are in the right channel. I cannot answer your question. But file:// is the protocol. file:/// indicates root directory.
Mar 20 16:21:34 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./ to be generic about it, or file://, or completely specific with file:///home/mock/. I'm not sure if this is any help, but I'm taking a shot in the dark.
Mar 20 16:22:13 <launchpadmcquak>	wait, you're saying i've been beating my head against a wall over a potential *extra* slash???
Mar 20 16:22:22 <mock>	Maybe
Mar 20 16:23:36 <Khaytsus>	that's alwys tripped me up before too, but pretty sure the URI is file:// so if you want to browse / it would be file:///
Mar 20 16:23:39 <Khaytsus>	but not sure
Mar 20 16:24:02 <mock>	I think we all have run across this at some point.
Mar 20 16:24:08 <launchpadmcquak>	hmmm, still not happy with the double slash: "Curl error (3): URL using bad/illegal format or missing URL for file://nfs/mock/repos/slurm/31/x86_64/repodata/repomd.xml"
Mar 20 16:24:39 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: Is nfs/mock relative or absolute from root?
Mar 20 16:24:52 <mock>	launchpadmcquak: You might try file://./nfs/mock/...
Mar 20 16:25:02 <launchpadmcquak>	the "file:///" approach works just fine in centos 7, no dice in fedora 31 it seems, was working in previous fedoras
Mar 20 16:25:13 <launchpadmcquak>	okay, trying that
Mar 20 16:25:27 <mock>	The configuration is the same for both OSes?
Mar 20 16:29:04 <Khaytsus>	If the absolute path is /nfs I think file:///nfs is correct
Mar 20 16:29:11 <launchpadmcquak>	pretty sure... <frantically trying to figure out how to use pastebin>
Mar 20 16:29:50 <FranciscoD>	launchpadmcquak: pipe command output to fpaste, or give it a file
Mar 20 16:29:55 <FranciscoD>	or copy paste to paste.fp.o
Mar 20 16:30:39 <mock>	Also can you specify the version numbers of the CentOS install and the Fedora 31 install?
Mar 20 16:31:45 <launchpadmcquak>	centos mock: https://pastebin.com/7gX4suCF

Apr 02 10:34:09 <skierpage>	kanarip: no matter, I see it's reported issue with a workaround, https://pagure.io/phabphourphedora/issue/8
Apr 02 11:33:55 <rudrab>	hi, when trying to load my dconf  setting to fedora (setting was created by fedora-31, loading to fedora-31), I am getting error: The operation attempted to modify one or more non-writable keys
Apr 02 11:34:49 <rudrab>	I tried the same file loading to clearlinux, and that worked. So, I guess, my file is ok, fedora has put some lock on dconf
Apr 02 11:34:59 <rudrab>	can anybody kindly help?
Apr 02 11:41:19 <rudrab>	also, /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks is empty
Apr 02 11:44:20 <Khaytsus>	And /etc/dconf/db/database.d/locks
Apr 02 11:45:22 <Khaytsus>	There are 3-4 locks directories..  I don't see anythihng here, but i also don't use gnome's hell
Apr 02 11:46:00 <Khaytsus>	Also make sure your selinux contexts aren't wrong, and obviously permissions
Apr 02 11:46:26 <rudrab>	database.d/ dir doesnt exist
Apr 02 11:46:56 <rudrab>	btw, i am loading the dconf as normal user ...not as root
Apr 02 11:47:07 <ersen>	are you trying to import '/org/gnome/login-screen' ?
Apr 02 11:47:56 <rudrab>	ersen: you mean org/gnome/login-screen]enable-fingerprint-authentication=trueenable-password-authentication=trueenable-smartcard-authentication=false lines?
Apr 02 11:48:12 <ersen>	yes
Apr 02 11:48:18 <rudrab>	yes...those are there
Apr 02 11:48:27 <ersen>	exclude them and try again
Apr 02 11:49:21 <rudrab>	is there any option to exclude? or I just delete them?
Apr 02 11:49:49 <ersen>	just delete them if you are trying to import from a file
Apr 02 11:50:30 <rudrab>	ah...great. that was the culprit
Apr 02 11:51:16 <rudrab>	thanks ersen
Apr 02 11:51:47 <ersen>	you are welcome
Apr 02 11:56:57 <miscing>	Hi, i have a strange issue. I have an external keyboard connected to my laptop. However certain commands don't work, for example i have binded ctrl+ctrl to change keyboard layout. It triggers correctly on laptop, but not with external keyboard. I used XEV to double check that the keycodes send are the exact same on each keyboard. Any suggestions
Apr 02 11:56:57 <miscing>	what it could be/where to look?

Apr 02 13:38:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz_, was there a winehq for f31?
Apr 02 13:39:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	a quick look at koji that would be a NO
Apr 02 13:39:45 <coz_>	Southern_Gentlem, yes there was
Apr 02 13:40:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	give me the koji link for it
Apr 02 13:41:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz_, not in the fedora or rpmfusion repos
Apr 02 13:41:13 <coz_>	no hold on

Apr 02 15:43:38 <AlexMax>	Nothing.
Apr 02 15:43:47 <AlexMax>	HOWEVER, I am running docker.
Apr 02 15:44:01 <billings>	is it the docker container that's having that issue?
Apr 02 15:44:01 <AlexMax>	And I do have that kernel option enabled that allows me to run docker
Apr 02 15:44:03 <mrvenkman>	That'll be it
Apr 02 15:44:13 <AlexMax>	(Sorry, I wanted to use podman, but i needed docker-compose)
Apr 02 15:44:33 <billings>	there's a podman-compose but it doesn't work with user containers
Apr 02 15:44:41 <billings>	so you have to sudo like a caveman
Apr 02 15:44:47 <AlexMax>	Yeah I saw, plus it looked sparsely maintained
Apr 02 15:44:58 <mrvenkman>	So I guess he doesn't have to worry, billings ?
Apr 02 15:45:32 <AlexMax>	I have no docker containers running though
Apr 02 15:45:45 <AlexMax>	They're all stopped
Apr 02 15:46:43 <mrvenkman>	can you telnet to yourip:8080 ?
Apr 02 15:46:55 <AlexMax>	I tried netcat, connection refused
Apr 02 15:47:36 <mrvenkman>	I'm out of suggestions mate :( Sorry. (I'm quite new though)
Apr 02 15:47:48 <AlexMax>	No, I appreciate your help
Apr 02 15:48:02 <mrvenkman>	:)
Apr 02 15:48:03 <AlexMax>	that goes for everybody ITC
Apr 02 15:48:51 <billings>	not sure what else could be hanging on to that port but not reporting it through lsof
Apr 02 15:49:03 <billings>	don't kill -9 in the future
Apr 02 15:49:04 <AlexMax>	OH SON OF A GUN
Apr 02 15:49:15 <AlexMax>	Oh man this is the biggest PBKAC in the world
Apr 02 15:49:30 <AlexMax>	Don't know if I should even say what it was because oh man I'm embarassed.
Apr 02 15:50:08 <AlexMax>	Rest assured, it was my fault, and I'm sorry that I sent everybody on a wild goose chase.
Apr 02 15:50:19 <mrvenkman>	hahah
Apr 02 15:50:23 <mrvenkman>	wrong shell?
Apr 02 15:50:32 <AlexMax>	No.  I wasn't scrolled up all the way.
Apr 02 15:50:40 <mrvenkman>	LOL
Apr 02 15:50:51 <AlexMax>	And missed where there was a second server create that I had forgotten about, from some testing I had done.
Apr 02 15:51:14 <mrvenkman>	AlexMax, "Usually when I fix these sort of obscure problems I learn something."
Apr 02 15:51:35 <AlexMax>	Hey, you joke, but I still learned something.
Apr 02 15:51:37 <AlexMax>	I had no idea ss was even a thing.
Apr 02 15:51:39 <mrvenkman>	You learned to check
Apr 02 15:51:46 <AlexMax>	Another tool for the toolbelt.
Apr 02 15:51:53 <mrvenkman>	Good man :)
Apr 02 15:52:30 <billings>	ss is effectively the replacement for netstat
Apr 02 15:52:35 <billings>	which is no longer maintained iirc
Apr 02 15:58:52 <mrvenkman>	Question: is my location and router IP address visible to everyone here?
Apr 02 15:59:43 <billings>	mrvenkman: ~mrvenkman@cpc127002-macc4-2-0-cust55.1-3.cable.virginm.net
Apr 02 16:00:03 <mrvenkman>	ok
Apr 02 16:00:05 <mrvenkman>	:(
Apr 02 16:00:11 <billings>	you can get a freenode mask
Apr 02 16:00:20 <mrvenkman>	how do I do that?
Apr 02 16:00:38 <mrvenkman>	I am worried that Southern_Gentlem is buying a shit load of movies.
Apr 02 16:00:45 <billings>	cloak, rather
Apr 02 16:00:47 <billings>	https://freenode.net/kb/answer/cloaks
Apr 02 16:00:50 <billings>	sorry
Apr 02 16:00:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman, i dont have time for that
Apr 02 16:00:56 <mrvenkman>	billings, thanks.
Apr 02 16:01:02 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, lol!
Apr 02 16:01:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	and google for fedora cloaks
Apr 02 16:01:21 <billings>	for example, my cloak makes me appear in whois as ~root@centos/community/billings
Apr 02 16:01:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  i have been here since fc1 so i am here to help, i have making fedora respins since fc5
Apr 02 16:02:00 <mrvenkman>	billings, would you say it's pretty insecure for me to not have a cloak?
Apr 02 16:02:06 <billings>	eh
Apr 02 16:02:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	no
Apr 02 16:02:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	i have a cloak because i am a chanop
Apr 02 16:02:30 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks :)
Apr 02 16:04:35 <mrvenkman>	Could you guys hack my router?
Apr 02 16:04:43 <mrvenkman>	If you wanted.
Apr 02 16:05:10 <mrvenkman>	Can I have a cloak?
Apr 02 16:05:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  not with that no
Apr 02 16:05:49 <mrvenkman>	I'm worried now.
Apr 02 16:05:56 <mrvenkman>	Ok, :) Phew!
Apr 02 16:06:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrvenkman,  be sure that you are not running your routors default passphrase
Apr 02 16:06:47 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, I don't think I am. :)
Apr 02 16:07:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	dont think KNOW
Apr 02 16:08:50 <mrvenkman>	I suppose the passphrase will probably be just ""
Apr 02 16:09:03 <mrvenkman>	So I know.
Apr 02 16:09:03 <mrvenkman>	lol
Apr 02 16:10:18 <mrvenkman>	Southern_Gentlem, thank you for your help since fc1
Apr 02 16:10:31 <mrvenkman>	The system is running lovely.
Apr 02 16:11:32 <mrvenkman>	I have Fedora31 running on a Ryzen5 processor, lenovo ideapad c340

Apr 02 16:37:41 <sdgathman>	When I update the kernel on f31, it uses the wrong LV for grubby.
Apr 02 16:38:08 <sdgathman>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b4ae44c2
Apr 02 16:38:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman, well it very funny that all this strange stuff always happens to you
Apr 02 16:38:37 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: because I experiment.
Apr 02 16:38:42 <sdgathman>	The correct LV is f31
Apr 02 16:38:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes because you love to shoot yourself in the foot
Apr 02 16:39:31 <sdgathman>	Background: I did an install of test version of Fedora to LV root, using the same /boot
Apr 02 16:39:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	and 5.5.13 pushed this morning as well
Apr 02 16:40:21 <sdgathman>	So the insns to use root LV are stored somewhere in /boot
Apr 02 16:40:43 <sdgathman>	BLS does this
Apr 02 16:41:29 <sdgathman>	I suppose I could switch back to BLSCFG=false
Apr 02 16:41:41 <sdgathman>	But I do try to use the new stuff in Fedora.
Apr 02 16:42:13 <sdgathman>	So, where does BLS store the root LV to use ??
Apr 02 16:42:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	no idea
Apr 02 16:42:37 <sdgathman>	I tried updating all kernels with grubby - didn't help.  (Other than the one I just installed.)
Apr 02 16:43:19 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: 5.5.13 is waiting to test whatever advice I receive (not from you, obviously).  This problem only happens on kernel update.
Apr 02 16:43:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	5.5.13 pushed to the mirrors this morning at 4am
Apr 02 16:43:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	edt
Apr 02 16:44:07 <sdgathman>	I am fully aware.  I get the emails.  See above.
Apr 02 16:44:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman,  is bls default in fedora
Apr 02 16:44:48 <sdgathman>	Yes
Apr 02 16:45:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	then why are you the only one with issues
Apr 02 16:45:05 <sdgathman>	GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
Apr 02 16:46:05 <sdgathman>	I am not personally in any danger - it is easy enough to run grubby to fix it.
Apr 02 16:47:03 <sdgathman>	And if I forget, to edit the kernel args in grub
Apr 02 16:48:30 <sdgathman>	The goal is to find out why grubby does this, and if it turns out to be a bug (as opposed to "BLS doesn't support multiple installs with same /boot"), then fix it.
Apr 02 16:49:29 <sdgathman>	This is not something that would endanger a regular Fedora user that doesn't have multiple Fedora installs on a desktop.
Apr 02 16:50:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	i would be more worried about win/fedora/other linux distro
Apr 02 16:54:14 <sdgathman>	BLS also breaks the upgrade procedure here: https://fedoramagazine.org/use-lvm-upgrade-fedora/
Apr 02 16:56:10 <sdgathman>	Googling "where does BLS get its data" tells me lots of stuff about Bureau of Labor Statistics :-)
Apr 02 17:01:46 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: in grub2.cfg there is a line:
Apr 02 17:02:03 <sdgathman>	set default_kernelopts="root=/dev/mapper/vg_melissa-f31 ro resume=/dev/mapper/vg_melissa-swap rd.lvm.lv=vg_melissa/f31 rd.lvm.lv=vg_melissa/swap rhgb quiet"
Apr 02 17:02:14 <sdgathman>	Which I just changed from root to f31
Apr 02 17:02:31 <sdgathman>	About to update to 5.5.13 and see if that fixes it.
Apr 02 17:03:51 *	Southern_Gentlem wishes we could tell livemedia-creator to alwayss install and verify the kernel last 
Apr 02 17:07:23 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: Nope.  Changing default_kernelopts did not fix it..  And, I've used up my update.
Apr 02 17:08:28 <sdgathman>	the /boot/loader/entries have this line: options $kernelopts
Apr 02 17:08:43 <sdgathman>	The the question is, where does kernelopts come from ???
Apr 02 17:09:29 <cheese-e-boi>	Hello, I am making a spin of Fedora and I am trying to create a package with configurations files, however this causes a package conflict when they're installed. What would be a better way of changing the default configuration files of the system in a manner that will not cause this issue?
Apr 02 17:09:53 <sdgathman>	BLS also stands for Basic Life Support
Apr 02 17:11:21 <Khaytsus>	cheese-e-boi: rebuild your own packages with those configs?
Apr 02 17:11:30 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1651686
Apr 02 17:12:00 <sdgathman>	Looks like you have to edit the grub2 environment variable.  Which is *not* friendly.
Apr 02 17:12:43 <sdgathman>	Eh, it's no worse than grubby
Apr 02 17:13:26 <cheese-e-boi>	Khaytsus: I guess I could but it just seems a bit overkill. But if that's the only option, I guess I'll do that. Thank you
Apr 02 17:13:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, what are you doing
Apr 02 17:14:25 <josvuk>	hello, i have f31 running in vbox on win10 host, know i have to make a backup because i have to rezise my system hd (only somme MB free) what tool should i use?
Apr 02 17:14:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, why not change those configs in the ks
Apr 02 17:14:55 <cheese-e-boi>	I'm attempting to make a Spin of Fedora with XFCE with some configuration changes using livecd-tools
Apr 02 17:15:17 <cheese-e-boi>	I might do that too
Apr 02 17:15:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	what changes are you making and did you start with the xfce ks or did you create your own
Apr 02 17:15:43 <cheese-e-boi>	It just sounded simpler to do that within a package but you're probably right
Apr 02 17:16:15 <cheese-e-boi>	I started with the base and repo kickstarts
Apr 02 17:16:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	cheese-e-boi, https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Livemedia-creator-_How_to_create_and_use_a_Live_CD
Apr 02 17:16:46 <Khaytsus>	What are you specifically trying to accompilsh, maybe Southern_Gentlem can suggest a better way
Apr 02 17:17:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	pull and flatten the xfce ks
Apr 02 17:17:19 <cheese-e-boi>	That's what I'm doing actually
Apr 02 17:17:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	be sure you edit fedora.repo and set to non-rawhide
Apr 02 17:17:33 <cheese-e-boi>	But I want to change the default shell for zsh first of all
Apr 02 17:17:41 <cheese-e-boi>	Yeah I've messed around for a bit with that
Apr 02 17:17:44 <sdgathman>	Southern_Gentlem: Setting an entry with grubby replaces $kernelopts with the new setting
Apr 02 17:18:17 <cheese-e-boi>	If you want to see what I've done I could send the gitlab link
Apr 02 17:18:22 <sdgathman>	So changing grub2 env changes all entries still using $kernelopts
Apr 02 17:19:12 <sdgathman>	Is there a way to make grubby use /etc/default/grub instead of a grub2 env variable ?
Apr 02 17:19:21 <cheese-e-boi>	Actually, I'll probably not make a package for this stuff; I'll just do it manually. Thanks for the help though
Apr 02 17:20:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	sdgathman, no
Apr 02 17:20:49 <sdgathman>	Maybe changing grub2.cfg to set kernelopts=... instead of set default_kernelopts=...
Apr 02 17:24:30 <sdgathman>	I'll try that out when testing f32 beta
Apr 02 17:37:51 <drindt>	hello ladies and gents, i appreciate your support. I open with nautilus an smb share (same since years) and from now on the permissions are shown wrong, timestamps too and so on. When i go in the mounted folder from gvfs it shows the same issues. So its not nautilus related. Opened the share with windows as usual, works as expected and the years before. Haven't found any information about this strange issue. Maybe someone can help me? Thank you
Apr 02 17:37:53 <drindt>	for reading.
Apr 02 17:44:47 <sdgathman>	drindt: I remember reading that Windows had changed CIFS security protocol, but I don't remember where.  Is the share served by an updated Windows box?
Apr 02 17:45:39 <icebp241>	im trying to do a fresh 31 install on kvm on a host running 31. when the iso boot i see graphics, but not anaconda
Apr 02 17:45:56 <icebp241>	i cant switch to it, i left it alone for a few, i get nadda
Apr 02 17:46:22 <drindt>	 the security is not the issue, i fixed that already, but now files are shown as folders and with wrong timestamps
Apr 02 17:46:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	icebp241, what iso are you using
Apr 02 17:46:52 <icebp241>	Southern_Gentlem Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-31-1.9.iso
Apr 02 17:47:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	grab the updated iso out of the topic
Apr 02 17:47:21 <icebp241>	alright, thanks
Apr 02 17:47:49 <Khaytsus>	drindt: What change from when it worked to when it didn't
Apr 02 17:48:23 <drindt>	Khaytsus: i would like to know it too. :) I assume this happens after the last fedora upgrade but not sure.
Apr 02 17:49:34 <sdgathman>	drindt: Is this related?  https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STXKQY_4.2.1/com.ibm.spectrum.scale.v4r21.doc/bl1pdg_winsmb2.htm
Apr 02 17:49:57 <sdgathman>	Is Windows or Fedora (or something else) serving the CIFS share?
Apr 02 17:51:10 <drindt>	It's a fritz.box, a router
Apr 02 17:51:26 <sdgathman>	Using SMB1 or SMB2 ?
Apr 02 17:51:51 <sdgathman>	And has the fritz.box been updated? :-)
Apr 02 17:53:26 <sdgathman>	SMB2 requires accurate change notification implementation - without it you get "inconsistent view of the namespace".
Apr 02 17:53:43 <icebp241>	Southern_Gentlem no luck with F31-WORK-x86_64-LIVE-20200319.iso either
Apr 02 17:54:05 <sdgathman>	icebp241: how much RAM for the VM?
Apr 02 17:54:14 <sdgathman>	I think you need at least 2G now.
Apr 02 17:54:24 <icebp241>	sdgathman 8GB
Apr 02 17:54:31 <icebp241>	4 vCPUs
Apr 02 17:54:33 <sdgathman>	That should be no problem.
Apr 02 17:55:03 *	sdgathman just upgraded from 8 to 16GB on VM host in Jan...
Apr 02 17:55:54 <chilversc>	sdgathman: can you get to a text terminal and check journalctl / dmesg?
Apr 02 17:56:23 <sdgathman>	chilversc: for what problem?
Apr 02 17:56:42 <sdgathman>	Or did you mean icebp241?
Apr 02 17:58:26 <icebp241>	chilversc nothing stands out
Apr 02 17:58:43 <chilversc>	sdgathman: sorry, got the wrong nick there

Apr 03 09:23:54 <Cymew>	Hi. I just wrote a markdown document in emacs, and when I want to preview it, I seems to be lacking a "markdown" binary to render it. Which package provides that? It seems dnf is not helpful.
Apr 03 09:33:09 <Cymew>	Nevermind, found the "discount" package.
Apr 03 09:57:57 <marmulak>	is it normal for dnf to segfault after downloading package files
Apr 03 09:58:31 <[Enrico]>	nope
Apr 03 09:59:09 <marmulak>	isn't that weird
Apr 03 11:31:41 <rindolf>	Hi all! I am getting an OCI error with podman/docker on f32 - https://paste.centos.org/view/43bd2158
Apr 03 11:39:33 <rindolf>	it seems to be working as user 'root' :(
Apr 03 11:47:14 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: hrm, not seen that: is this a fresh install?
Apr 03 11:47:17 <FranciscoD>	or an upgrade?
Apr 03 11:47:47 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: an upgrade
Apr 03 11:47:54 <FranciscoD>	hrm, me too
Apr 03 11:48:04 <FranciscoD>	anything in the journal: `journalctl -b` ?
Apr 03 11:49:08 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: trying to reproduce it now
Apr 03 11:49:36 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: worked here XD
Apr 03 11:50:26 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: oh, that sucks
Apr 03 11:51:00 <FranciscoD>	https://paste.centos.org/view/23b17a71
Apr 03 11:51:41 <FranciscoD>	will need some debugging, not sure where to start though.
Apr 03 11:51:42 <FranciscoD>	try #podman?
Apr 03 11:53:02 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: https://paste.centos.org/view/66b1d19c
Apr 03 11:54:03 <FranciscoD>	I some context related info
Apr 03 11:54:08 <FranciscoD>	selinux labelling maybe?
Apr 03 11:54:59 <FranciscoD>	try the selinux troubleshooter? `sudo dnf install /usr/bin/sealert`?
Apr 03 11:55:05 <FranciscoD>	that'll list denials
Apr 03 11:55:35 <FranciscoD>	simple way of checking is also to `sudo setenforce 0` to temporarily set selinux to permissive and checking if it works
Apr 03 12:11:56 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: sudo setenforce 0 did not help
Apr 03 12:15:21 <FranciscoD>	aye, lets hope the #podman folks can help figure it out
Apr 03 12:19:23 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: thanks
Apr 03 14:31:25 *	billings wonders if cgroupsv2 was disabled
Apr 03 15:40:42 <mfilipe[m]>	something is wrong with my software store. flathub already updated the riot app but my software store doesn't show it to update. anyone knows what is wrong?
Apr 03 15:48:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	had you applied updates earlier and it applied and you didnt realize
Apr 03 15:48:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	??
Apr 03 15:50:30 <retentiveboy>	Feeling silly for having to ask...  FServer31 instance in a VM without issues. Shutdown, added second network interface, booted back up.  Can't SSH into it now on the original interface but can on DHCP address it pulled on the added interface. tcpdump shows first packet of Inbound connection on the original interface then stalls.
Apr 03 15:51:08 <retentiveboy>	Disabled firewall, no change.  disabled selinux, no change.
Apr 03 15:51:40 <retentiveboy>	netstat -an show it's listening on 0.0.0.0:22 as expected.
Apr 03 15:51:58 <retentiveboy>	adjusted sshd configs to listen on the original IP, not 0.0.0.0. no change.
Apr 03 15:52:21 <Puck`>	how about firewalls, retentiveboy ?
Apr 03 15:52:32 <Puck`>	try stopping firewalld sercice
Apr 03 15:52:35 <Puck`>	*service
Apr 03 15:52:43 <retentiveboy>	systemctl stop firewalld, no change.
Apr 03 15:53:26 <retentiveboy>	tcpdump shows initial inbound packet so no firewall on the client in the way.
Apr 03 15:53:51 <retentiveboy>	weird.
Apr 03 15:54:01 <prussian>	firewalld may be activated via dbus/socket
Apr 03 15:54:11 <prussian>	if you really want it dead, systemctl mask firewalld
Apr 03 15:54:13 <dowdle>	retentiveboy: When working with multiple network interfaces, I'm guessing you need to mark one of them as "do not use this as a default gateway".
Apr 03 15:54:14 <retentiveboy>	iptables -L shows empty tables
Apr 03 15:55:14 <retentiveboy>	ah, yes...  routing issue.  I see responses going out the other interface.
Apr 03 15:55:23 <retentiveboy>	thx, dowdle
Apr 03 15:55:46 <prussian>	I was just gonna say, check ip route output

Apr 03 23:35:07 <alloy>	greetings #fedora :)
Apr 03 23:37:00 <alloy>	I've got fedora server 31 running in vmware workstation as a test machine.... the network adaptor ens33 keeps dropping out then coming back, is this something you'all see a lot of?
Apr 03 23:39:53 <daniel-wtd>	alloy: In vsphere/esx and kvm or vagrant (libvirt) I cannot see this behaviour. Havent used vmware workstation for years. :/
Apr 03 23:40:20 <alloy>	it's one of the few pieces of software I buy :)
Apr 03 23:40:51 <alloy>	(not because I'm some rabid pirate, it's just super useful - works really nicely with esx as a console etc)
Apr 03 23:42:06 <alloy>	I think it might be a vmware thing, although I have an identical VM running ubuntu server and that doesn't seem to do it... (i'm pairing the terminals to test commands in both distros)
Apr 03 23:45:09 <alloy>	oops, sorry to bother yas, it's happening in ubuntu too...
Apr 03 23:45:16 *	alloy shakes fist at vmware
Apr 03 23:45:59 <alloy>	daniel-wtd, give workstation pro a go though, it's fine software (this glitch not withstanding) :D
Apr 03 23:46:12 <alloy>	ciao
Apr 03 23:46:26 <daniel-wtd>	im using vsphere only because custmers have it in use ^^
Apr 03 23:46:40 <daniel-wtd>	for me and my company, 100% open source for infrastructure ^^
Apr 03 23:47:12 <specing>	alloy: stop promoting proprietary software. It is not cool.
Apr 03 23:48:05 <alloy>	specing, hah really?  vmware have done so much for Linux I disagree.
Apr 03 23:48:59 <alloy>	I've been using GNU/Linux since the 90s, everything I do is opensource, I've contributed code, and like I said it's one of the only things I buy because it helps my work as a career Linux Engineer so much.
Apr 03 23:49:24 <alloy>	it was a tip, not a promotion.
Apr 03 23:49:30 <specing>	Like violate the GPL?
Apr 03 23:49:42 <alloy>	so you are anti Red Hat then?
Apr 03 23:49:42 <daniel-wtd>	nevertheless, this is a fedora channel and not a "lets promote your personal software preference" channel
Apr 03 23:49:51 <daniel-wtd>	Red Hat = Open Source
Apr 03 23:51:32 <alloy>	wow, you guys need to relax.
Apr 03 23:54:27 <alloy>	it was a friend of mine (another mike) that noticed vmware were using the kernel in the way they were back in the early 2000s, since then they have changed that, it's old news.
Apr 03 23:54:28 <dowdle>	alloy: I bought VMware for Linux in 1999... and ran Windows 98 in it.  We use VMware at work... not me though... I prefer the Linux native hypervisor, KVM.
Apr 03 23:54:49 <alloy>	dowdle, yeah that's when I started using it too :)
Apr 03 23:56:53 <dowdle>	alloy: I work for a university and we subscribe to some academic program VMware has (admin'ed by On-the-Hub) and I could get VMware at no cost to me, but I prefer to use KVM.  I'm not fond of building kernel stubb modules every time the kernel gets updated... and Fedora is usually pretty darn closed to the latest, greatest upstream kernel release... which 3rd party modules sometimes have a problem with.

Apr 04 17:16:00 <FixPleaseTo>	it strikes me that maybe developing 64 bit computing would have *begun with* 100% backward compatibility.  otherwise it's a *downgrade* unless of course everything could immediately be ported to 64 bit, and the prior platform made irrelevant.  clearly that scenario didn't come about, so why is there no compatibility?
Apr 04 17:16:41 <FixPleaseTo>	I thought we're telling the compiler to "make 32 bit!" and all it's saying is "unable to comply".  robots have gotten shot in the face for less than that, I believe

Apr 04 22:05:57 <z22_temp>	Hi
Apr 04 22:16:59 <LRB>	Anybody know of a method to disable the disabling of a mouse pad while typing? There's apparently a bug in the xfce4 that's shipping with Fedora 31. I'm just looking for a command or something to directly interact with the settings.
Apr 04 22:27:03 <z22_temp>	For Touchpad in gpaphic env is in system settings/Hardware/Input Devices/Touchpad/EnableDisable Toouchpad ...
Apr 04 22:31:04 <LRB>	I'm not really sure what you mean. I'm not seeing that in xfce4-settings-editor or xfce4-settings-manager
Apr 04 22:33:45 <z22_temp>	sorry, i'm in kde, there must be something similar.
Apr 04 22:34:20 <LRB>	There is usually. There's a bug preventing it from appearing in the xfce4-settings-manager
Apr 04 22:34:26 <chrisawi>	LRB: is the xfce spin using libinput or synaptics?
Apr 04 22:34:51 <LRB>	chrisawi: It's using synaptics.
Apr 04 22:35:47 <LRB>	Somebody said to install xorg-x11-drv-synaptics-legacy but that caused my touchpad to ignore the "natural scrolling" or whatever it's called in xfce4
Apr 04 22:36:00 <LRB>	reversed scrolling
Apr 04 22:36:34 <chrisawi>	if that package wasn't installed already, then you were using libinput before
Apr 04 22:37:04 <LRB>	Ah. It's showing up as a synaptics device even when the package isn't installed, so maybe that's why I was confused
Apr 04 22:38:40 <chrisawi>	for libinput, you can configure it at runtime with xinput like this: https://elementaryos.stackexchange.com/a/9306
Apr 04 22:39:10 <chrisawi>	for the synaptics driver, there is a `synclient` command
Apr 04 22:39:34 <LRB>	Ah cool, thanks

Apr 10 13:32:53 <Araneidae>	Just install F32 on a laptop and need to connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network: can't see an option for this!
Apr 10 13:34:08 <Araneidae>	The only option seems to be "Select a network" which doesn't include my network
Apr 10 13:34:29 <Khaytsus>	WHy would it show a hidden network?  btw, hidden networks are ONLY annoying, they do NOTHING useful.
Apr 10 13:34:37 <Araneidae>	That's as may be
Apr 10 13:34:57 <Khaytsus>	The network SSID is visible about every 5 seconds if you're watching for traffic, so it's pretty utterly pointless and annoying and does nothing.
Apr 10 13:35:01 <Araneidae>	You're not telling me the ability to select a hidden network has been removed because its "annoying"?
Apr 10 13:35:17 <Khaytsus>	No, I'm saying having it hidden is pointlessly annoying for you.
Apr 10 13:35:29 <Khaytsus>	I'm booting a machine with network mangler
Apr 10 13:35:52 <Araneidae>	Again, that's as may be.  I'm connecting to a network that has been configured like this for over a decade
Apr 10 13:35:58 <Khaytsus>	Ah welp, that won't work, no wifi on a vm.  Anyway, I'm pretty sure it's just "Add connection"
Apr 10 13:36:11 <Khaytsus>	If it's your network, just unhide it.
Apr 10 13:36:38 <Araneidae>	Why has this been downgraded?  This is just a retrograde step
Apr 10 13:36:44 <Khaytsus>	Next dumb thing poeple do; mac filtering.  As if the MAC (ie:  wireless ethernet address) isn't also immediately visible.
Apr 10 13:37:07 <Khaytsus>	No idea if it has been.  You're seeing a difference?
Apr 10 13:37:28 <Araneidae>	Yes.  This is my first install of F32, my other machines work jsut fine thank you
Apr 10 13:38:02 <Araneidae>	Presumably something is store somewhere in /etc/networks or the like, suppose I have to go looking now :(
Apr 10 13:38:29 <Khaytsus>	Ah well, was going to look but no NM here except in VMs.  But 99% sure it's just "add connection"
Apr 10 13:39:29 <Araneidae>	"Add Connection" does sound right, but I'm struggling to find it!
Apr 10 13:40:11 <Araneidae>	Under settings I've got Wi-Fi which just shows "Visible Networks" (and an Aeroplane Mode button)
Apr 10 13:40:29 <Araneidae>	Network, which covers Wired, VPN, Proxy
Apr 10 13:40:41 <Khaytsus>	right click the NM applet, edit connections, hit the Plus?
Apr 10 13:41:28 <Araneidae>	The settings box shows a list of entries on the left (which is where I'm seeing Wi-Fi), but it's not right-clickable
Apr 10 13:41:35 <linuxmodder>	like Khaytsus  is saying 'hiding a network' only makes it safe against stupid attackers, anyone that knows how to look is gonna target you more just due to that fact alone
Apr 10 13:42:20 <Khaytsus>	No right click/  Hmm..  looking, sec
Apr 10 13:44:03 <Khaytsus>	Yeah right click NM's applet here shows the normal menus
Apr 10 13:44:21 <Araneidae>	So how do you bring up the Applet?
Apr 10 13:44:44 <Khaytsus>	Oh, well..  hmm..  I'm using XFCE, no idea how it shows up in Gnome I guess
Apr 10 13:44:51 <Araneidae>	All I'm doing is selecting Settings from the Activities Search
Apr 10 13:45:09 <Araneidae>	Oh, it's ****ing Gnome being patronising again, isn't it
Apr 10 13:45:13 <Khaytsus>	but yeah look for Network Connections I think it's called to run?
Apr 10 13:45:23 <Khaytsus>	that hsould bring up the NM app
Apr 10 13:45:45 <Araneidae>	Ohhhh
Apr 10 13:45:45 <Khaytsus>	I don't seem to have a Workstation VM installed at the moment
Apr 10 13:46:06 <Araneidae>	It's hidden under a ... button on the top right of Settings!
Apr 10 13:46:23 <Khaytsus>	Makes sense.
Apr 10 13:46:32 <Araneidae>	Under [...] (vertical dots) is a menu ... with "Connect to Hidden Network..."
Apr 10 13:46:32 <Khaytsus>	I'm not allowed to express my love for Gnome anymore, so.. yeah
Apr 10 13:46:38 <Araneidae>	Ta
Apr 10 13:46:46 <Araneidae>	"Love" for Gnome?
Apr 10 13:46:58 <Khaytsus>	It involves torches and pitchforks
Apr 10 13:47:10 <Araneidae>	I've put it on because I'm lazy (my main desktop is XFCE, my work workstation is fluxbox)
Apr 10 13:47:44 <Araneidae>	Anyhow, thanks for the help.  Think I'm getting there...
Apr 10 13:47:48 <Khaytsus>	Every time I test the Workstation spin I hate every second.
Apr 10 13:48:00 <Khaytsus>	But glad you got it sorted, but yeah, hiding that under a few things seems pretty silly.
Apr 10 13:48:07 <Araneidae>	What's the most robust Fedora Spin that isn't Gnome?
Apr 10 13:48:18 <Khaytsus>	Gnome seems to optimze usability at the expense of usability.
Apr 10 13:48:18 <Araneidae>	I'll watch for that little button elsewhere
Apr 10 13:48:28 <Khaytsus>	I've used XFCE for years personally.
Apr 10 13:52:40 <Khaytsus>	Used KDE for years until it died at 3.5.  I revisit every few years or so, poke at it, put it back in the oven to cook for another few years.
Apr 10 13:53:47 <Araneidae>	Well, we use Gnome at work (I'm out on a limb with fluxbox), and each time there's a system upgrade (such a big damned deal) it seems to get a little harder to use :(
Apr 10 13:54:28 <Khaytsus>	Eventually it'll just be a single button.
Apr 10 13:54:36 <Khaytsus>	They remove features every release.
Apr 10 13:55:09 <Araneidae>	:)

Apr 10 15:16:46 <short-bike>	Anyone in here running wireguard on f31 ?
Apr 10 15:17:46 <mfilipe[m]>	short-bike: o/
Apr 10 15:17:58 <mfilipe[m]>	i'm running inside of my host (fedora package)
Apr 10 15:18:06 <mfilipe[m]>	when i tried to use snap/flatpak, it didn't work as expected
Apr 10 15:19:27 <short-bike>	mfilipe[m]: TY. Apart from that, any other issues you have run into ? I'm looking to run it on an f31 bare metal box.
Apr 10 15:19:44 <mfilipe[m]>	no
Apr 10 15:19:51 <mfilipe[m]>	i used to sniff a http package without problems
Apr 10 15:19:56 <short-bike>	Cool. Thank you.
Apr 10 15:23:32 <short-bike>	Lastly, is the copr repo needed for wireguard ?
Apr 10 15:29:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	you can look to see if the copr package is newer than whats in the fedora repos
Apr 10 15:33:11 <guiekguiek>	Shouldn't this prompt for username/password since dnf requires sudo privileges? Here is the pastebin https://pastebin.com/50m4aFKX
Apr 10 15:36:03 <Khaytsus>	It uses packagekit, and you've likely already used it before
Apr 10 15:36:46 <Khaytsus>	guiekguiek: Plus you're in the wheel group, yes?
Apr 10 15:38:00 <short-bike>	Southern_Gentlem: Thanks - I'll check.
Apr 10 15:38:36 <guiekguiek>	@Khaytsus yes I am in the wheel group
Apr 10 15:38:51 <Khaytsus>	So yes, that's working as designed.
Apr 10 15:38:52 <guiekguiek>	In sudoers I need to be prompted for password
Apr 10 15:39:10 <guiekguiek>	Is my sudo privilege cached in PackageKit
Apr 10 15:39:14 <Khaytsus>	No.
Apr 10 15:39:17 <Khaytsus>	It's not using sudo.
Apr 10 15:39:38 <guiekguiek>	Can you please explain how it works?
Apr 10 15:40:19 <Khaytsus>	No, but you can research it.
Apr 10 15:41:07 <Khaytsus>	If you want to personally remove what that is doing, just remove the packagekit not found package.
Apr 10 15:41:33 <Khaytsus>	PackageKit-command-not-found
Apr 10 15:44:33 <\n3p\>	Fedora 32 is working fine for me since more than a month. Thank you developers!
Apr 10 15:44:46 <Khaytsus>	10 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, 5 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Apr 10 16:05:53 <FixPleaseTo>	might b I'm just slow, but isn't there supposed to be a command like "magick" in fedora? LOL
Apr 10 16:06:09 <FixPleaseTo>	-for converting graphics files
Apr 10 16:07:37 <Khaytsus>	https://google.com/search?q=image+magick+howto
Apr 10 16:07:59 <short-bike>	imagemagic aka - imagemagick. But the core of those files are installed by default. for ex. convert (file-a) (file-b) by extension works.
Apr 10 16:08:17 <dsmster>	anyone else on fc32 see crun package update fail with :  lsetfilecon: (/usr/bin/crun;5e908afe, system_u:object_r:container_runtime_exec_t:s0) Invalid argument
Apr 10 16:10:22 <Khaytsus>	dsmster: Updating the crun package with dnf you mean, or?
Apr 10 16:10:47 <Khaytsus>	I just updated a 32 here and saw no obvious issues, but wasn't looking closely
Apr 10 16:18:57 <dsmster>	yeah, i noticed that Software app, just spun forever trying to list today's updates, so I ran dnf update, crun wanted to go from 0.13-1 to 0.13-2 and that selinux thing was the only anomoly I noticed so far
Apr 10 16:19:24 <dsmster>	i will go look at the packageutil logs i guess next to see if it's having the same type of problem with crun package
Apr 10 16:19:56 <dsmster>	or maybe this is a script running that is incompatible with some of my personal containers that are quite old IDK
Apr 10 16:22:13 <Khaytsus>	Never used packagekit intentionally, so udnno

Apr 10 16:53:52 <\n3p\>	bhermon, You need rpmfusion-free-updates and rpmfusion-NONFREE + updates for some extra packages
Apr 10 16:54:03 <ledeni>	bhermon,yes you have it
Apr 10 16:54:48 <ledeni>	bhermon, run in term 'sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs compat-ffmpeg'
Apr 10 16:55:34 <ledeni>	bhermon, sorrythis  'sudo dnf install ffmpeg ffmpeg-libs compat-ffmpeg28'
Apr 10 16:59:54 <bhermon>	Working on it, seems to take awhile
Apr 10 17:00:30 <ledeni>	bhermon, after that you need h264 codecs read https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenH264
Apr 10 17:05:06 <kwizart>	ledeni, not once you have rpmfusion installed
Apr 10 17:05:32 <kwizart>	I mean ffmpeg (and no need to use the compat-ffmpeg28 anymore for firefox)
Apr 10 17:05:53 <kwizart>	chromium would requires to use the chromium-freeworld package
Apr 10 17:06:23 <ledeni>	bhermon, once you install h264 codec close firefox  and reopen .should be fine after this you can watch videos
Apr 10 17:06:44 <bhermon>	sorry, I was trying to pipe it to fpaste and it stalled at the is this ok? prompt
Apr 10 17:08:00 <ledeni>	bhermon, what you want to pipe
Apr 10 17:11:24 <JEEB>	so I am seeing an issue that after successfully running dnf system upgrade download for 31-to-32 (since I saw that the worst blockers seemed to get closed), when after the reboot the module attempts to do a verification of the RPMs it downloaded, it seems to always fail?
Apr 10 17:11:39 <ledeni>	kwizart, sorry main experience i need compat-ffmpeg28 for run some videos and cost nothing to have it install
Apr 10 17:11:43 <JEEB>	I do not see any issues utilizing dnf for normal package upgrades, and my I/O device seems to be OK
Apr 10 17:12:12 <JEEB>	I quickly searched and I didn't see anything relevant in search results for 31 to 32 yet.
Apr 10 17:14:20 <bhermon>	ok, it's working, many thanks.
Apr 10 17:14:25 <kwizart>	ledeni, nothing use compat-ffmpeg28 but spotify (for few features) nowadays
Apr 10 17:15:21 <JEEB>	ok, another attempt for this, let's see if I get any checksum failures... the fifth or so time in a row? and somehow always only with system upgrade
Apr 10 17:16:14 <ledeni>	kwizart, try to run https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIk7gwjgIM
Apr 10 17:16:49 <ledeni>	kwizart, without compat-ffmeg28
Apr 10 17:20:59 <JEEB>	:< http://up-cat.net/p/5bd6cf07
Apr 10 17:21:31 <JEEB>	why on earth would this only happen with dnf system-upgrade download and not with normal package updates
Apr 10 17:22:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, what command are you using
Apr 10 17:22:40 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32
Apr 10 17:22:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:23:15 <short-bike>	ANd what repo's have you enabled - I was under the impression f32 was still not GA ?
Apr 10 17:23:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	short-bike, thus the fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:23:48 <short-bike>	Gotcha Southern_Gentlem
Apr 10 17:23:54 <JEEB>	short-bike: yea I am upgrading to non-GA because it seems like freeze period is starting and the major blockers got closed with gnome session segfaulting etc
Apr 10 17:24:04 <JEEB>	(specifically the wayland compositor apparently crashing until now)
Apr 10 17:24:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 17:24:20 <JEEB>	yes, I was doing that
Apr 10 17:24:30 <JEEB>	just validating the paste link opens ok here
Apr 10 17:24:48 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/af6c19e7
Apr 10 17:24:50 <JEEB>	there you go
Apr 10 17:26:15 <JEEB>	should be pretty vanilla fc31 except I got used to enabling -testing because sometimes security updates took otherwise longer to get in
Apr 10 17:26:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	hmmm so why have you been playing in updates-testing
Apr 10 17:26:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	run your command again
Apr 10 17:27:05 <JEEB>	?
Apr 10 17:27:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	this time paste all including your command to paste.centos.org please
Apr 10 17:27:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32
Apr 10 17:27:42 <JEEB>	I can just post the two dnf.logs since those should have everything. the download and then the next reboot
Apr 10 17:27:49 <JEEB>	the download part succeeds as far as I can tell
Apr 10 17:27:55 <JEEB>	let me just post them
Apr 10 17:28:26 <JEEB>	and if you want me to downgrade everything to non-testing then if there's a quick command for that I can then do that
Apr 10 17:28:42 <JEEB>	although a lot of updates in testing just ends up in stable just a few days later
Apr 10 17:28:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well then what is this then http://up-cat.net/p/5bd6cf07
Apr 10 17:29:20 <JEEB>	that's a snippet from the post-reboot actual upgrade
Apr 10 17:29:25 <JEEB>	let me just post the log files
Apr 10 17:29:33 <JEEB>	I did think I noted that the download went seemingly OK
Apr 10 17:29:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	lets try the download again please
Apr 10 17:30:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am suspecting an out of date mirror
Apr 10 17:30:12 <JEEB>	ok, I will clear my caches and run it again if you don't want my older dnf.log from my previous run :)
Apr 10 17:30:26 <JEEB>	(although that was just a few minutes earlier)
Apr 10 17:30:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	the --refresh should clear your cache
Apr 10 17:30:41 <JEEB>	yes, I am always running that since I've had bad cases of updates not propagating
Apr 10 17:31:00 <JEEB>	anyways, clearing downloaded packages and retrying
Apr 10 17:31:17 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade clean and that one again
Apr 10 17:32:29 <JEEB>	I'll post the full stdout and stderr as it finishes
Apr 10 17:32:49 <Southern_Gentlem>	please include your command
Apr 10 17:33:04 <JEEB>	dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32 &> ~root/system-upgrade-download.log
Apr 10 17:33:45 <JEEB>	I don't think it logs it in the log, unless I bump verbosity, maybe? so if you are not trusting me to run what I say I run then we might have a problem
Apr 10 17:34:43 <JEEB>	I know that dnf recently got an upgrade with modules in -testing, so unless someone had an idea I'd probably try downgrading that to the previous one https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9
Apr 10 17:35:22 <short-bike>	Does --refresh clear out the downloaded meta-data - I though 'clean all' was the only arg that did that ?
Apr 10 17:35:36 <JEEB>	it at least always downloads new data
Apr 10 17:35:56 <JEEB>	you might need to clean all if you really want to get rid of all caches before that
Apr 10 17:36:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	man dnf
Apr 10 17:37:37 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: also btw if your hostility towards me that I'm perceiving here is due to there a separate channel for upgrades to not-yet-GA releases then I will just take the hint and move there if you can hint at a more proper venue.
Apr 10 17:38:09 <JEEB>	ok, the topic says F32 beta as well :P
Apr 10 17:38:41 <JEEB>	ok, it finished. uploading the stdout and stderr
Apr 10 17:38:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB,  i am not being hostile to you in anyway, i am sorry if you think i am
Apr 10 17:39:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	the man dnf was for short-bike
Apr 10 17:39:59 <JEEB>	ok, no problem then. my misreading then. I just read into the way my dnf log files etc weren't good enough, since they seem to be very similar to the stdout/stderr.
Apr 10 17:40:17 <JEEB>	now let me just get that stdout+err into a bin
Apr 10 17:40:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	i asked a question about updates-testing and you answered so i went on to something else
Apr 10 17:41:56 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: https://0x0.st/iSJE.log
Apr 10 17:42:18 <JEEB>	that's `dnf system-upgrade download --refresh --releasever=32 &> ~root/system-upgrade-download.log`
Apr 10 17:42:26 <JEEB>	which did succeed previously as well
Apr 10 17:42:39 <JEEB>	the only failure came as I run the reboot into system upgrade
Apr 10 17:42:52 <JEEB>	when it started checking the packages downloaded, apparently
Apr 10 17:43:00 <JEEB>	for that you only have the dnf logs
Apr 10 17:43:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	try that now to see if you still get that same error
Apr 10 17:43:31 <JEEB>	roger that, although I'm not really hopeful :)
Apr 10 17:43:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	**crossing fingers**
Apr 10 17:44:41 <JEEB>	let's just say I did it the first time around 2AM today, and then one time with and one time without updates-testing enabled from 32 afterwards
Apr 10 17:44:44 <JEEB>	:)
Apr 10 17:44:47 <JEEB>	anyways, it started
Apr 10 17:45:43 <JEEB>	the new upgrade view which I think got enabled with 31 is pretty nice, although I did like the actual numbers X/Y
Apr 10 17:46:16 <JEEB>	ok, it rebooted at 0% so most likely another checksum error. I will post the dnf log from the system upgrade
Apr 10 17:46:56 <JEEB>	I have a hunch it might be the in-testing update to dnf and modules so I will attempt to downgrade to current updates
Apr 10 17:48:33 <JEEB>	anyways, back to normal desktop so posting hte log
Apr 10 17:49:47 <JEEB>	https://0x0.st/iSJk.log
Apr 10 17:50:08 <JEEB>	expected result, at this point
Apr 10 17:51:19 <JEEB>	apparently parts of the log ended up in dnf.log.1, so posting that as well. it has the download as well
Apr 10 17:51:31 <JEEB>	https://0x0.st/iSJn.1
Apr 10 17:52:31 <JEEB>	2020-04-10T16:44:10Z DDEBUG Extra commands: ['system-upgrade', 'reboot'] is where I initiated the reboot
Apr 10 17:52:43 <JEEB>	2020-04-10T16:45:06Z DDEBUG Extra commands: ['system-upgrade', 'upgrade']
Apr 10 17:52:53 <JEEB>	is where it booted into the system upgrade env
Apr 10 17:53:27 <JEEB>	also the dnf logs have the dnf version I'm currently running which is https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9 as noted
Apr 10 17:53:39 <JEEB>	I'll attempt to go back to stable update
Apr 10 17:53:48 <kwizart>	ledeni, I'm looking into this, because I have both ffmpeg and compat installed, but I still cannot play the stream (h264/adts/TS), so there is maybe another dependency involved
Apr 10 17:54:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb yes i see the issue but i cant tell if it was a mirror issue or a package issue
Apr 10 17:55:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	cat /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo |fpaste please
Apr 10 17:56:02 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/05dcaecf
Apr 10 17:56:09 <JEEB>	should be pretty vanilla, I think?
Apr 10 17:57:04 <JEEB>	I should also have teh cisco and the modular repos enabled
Apr 10 17:57:17 <JEEB>	I can just paste a grep of enabled based on the files in yum.repos.d
Apr 10 17:58:12 <mfilipe[m]>	hi folks! i'm running snap of skype but somehow it isn't communicating with pulseaudio. i have the same problem with slack. do you know how to enable pulseaudio in these apps in fedora?
Apr 10 17:58:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m],  contact the authors
Apr 10 17:58:46 <JEEB>	https://paste.centos.org/view/e5f7e1ef
Apr 10 17:58:48 <JEEB>	there you go
Apr 10 17:59:00 <JEEB>	that's all the repos I have atm, and their enabled status
Apr 10 17:59:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb are you using anything from the modular repos
Apr 10 17:59:55 <JEEB>	that I think came up in the system upgrade, there were like four-five packages that for some reason got installed from modular
Apr 10 18:00:03 <JEEB>	like gimp, awk, meson and jinja
Apr 10 18:00:22 <JEEB>	I didn't specifically request them to get installed through there
Apr 10 18:00:42 <JEEB>	but the system upgrade seemed to correctly remove those if you look at the logs
Apr 10 18:00:48 <JEEB>	or well, decide to
Apr 10 18:00:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the old days the repo files had a baseurl link to the master mirror which has been removed
Apr 10 18:00:51 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: i do not have the same problem when i'm using ubuntu. i believe this is a problems between snapd and fedora, not a problem in the applications.
Apr 10 18:01:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	we dont use snap we use flatpak
Apr 10 18:01:48 *	cyberpear finds the baseurl removal annoying
Apr 10 18:02:01 <mfilipe[m]>	as far as i know fedora has a snapd package, so it uses snap as well
Apr 10 18:02:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb so my idea was to point your repos at the master mirror
Apr 10 18:02:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m],  dont mean we will support it here
Apr 10 18:02:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	if you think there is an error in the package please file a bugzilla
Apr 10 18:02:48 <mfilipe[m]>	why:
Apr 10 18:02:51 <mfilipe[m]>	 * why?
Apr 10 18:03:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	not many of us use it
Apr 10 18:03:07 <whatnow111>	hello. simple question. i was trying to open the app Transmission in the terminal by typing Transmission, but it didn't work. anyone know why?
Apr 10 18:03:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	at all
Apr 10 18:03:24 <mfilipe[m]>	i will try to find a way to debug this
Apr 10 18:03:42 <JEEB>	Southern_Gentlem: so replace the baseurl with some specific mirror's baseurl?
Apr 10 18:03:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111,  rpm -qa |grep transmission  compare with dnf search transmission
Apr 10 18:04:15 <whatnow111>	i have the app already.
Apr 10 18:04:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	jeeb yep if we know that mirror is updated
Apr 10 18:04:37 <JEEB>	but this anyways is really weird
Apr 10 18:04:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	since we are seeing different packages with the same error to me its out of date mirrors
Apr 10 18:04:50 <whatnow111>	southern, ok. i will try.
Apr 10 18:04:57 <JEEB>	since it clearly downloads and is OK with the result?
Apr 10 18:05:37 <JEEB>	anyways, let me first try downgrading the packages from https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-d51dbe83a9 to stable updates
Apr 10 18:05:49 <JEEB>	dnf plugins and libdnf/-repo etc
Apr 10 18:05:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB,  besides that i will have to point you at the #fedora-qa to see if they have anyother ideas
Apr 10 18:06:12 <JEEB>	yeh
Apr 10 18:06:37 <JEEB>	it seems very weird and opaque, you'd think it would do the check after download as well, and if it does then that one passes
Apr 10 18:07:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so what is the result of rpm -qa |grep transmission
Apr 10 18:07:55 <JEEB>	but fedora has had a pretty good track record for me until now :D https://paste.centos.org/view/6f1afa81
Apr 10 18:07:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so what is the result of rpm -qa |grep transmission |fpaste
Apr 10 18:08:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	JEEB, yeah at this point its over my head so #fedora-qa
Apr 10 18:08:53 <JEEB>	roger that
Apr 10 18:09:37 <whatnow111>	southern, actually, i'm using manjaro now. i thought it should work with all distros.  i think most people in manjaro channel are taking a nap so i just came here.
Apr 10 18:10:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, then why should i not ban you is the next question
Apr 10 18:10:38 <whatnow111>	southern, i use fedora too.
Apr 10 18:10:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	but you are not in fedora asking the question now are you
Apr 10 18:11:03 <whatnow111>	i dual boot on this computer.
Apr 10 18:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	so
Apr 10 18:11:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	the rpm command is think should work on both distros
Apr 10 18:11:58 <whatnow111>	ok. let me try.
Apr 10 18:12:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	and you didnt ever try
Apr 10 18:13:16 <whatnow111>	hmm. rpm doesn't work.
Apr 10 18:13:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	what package manager does manjaro use
Apr 10 18:13:56 <whatnow111>	pacman
Apr 10 18:14:07 <Khaytsus>	You're asking about a problem in manjaro in #fedora ?
Apr 10 18:14:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes he is
Apr 10 18:14:23 *	Khaytsus blinks
Apr 10 18:15:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, in your terminal if you type transmission and press tab what happens
Apr 10 18:17:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, https://paste.centos.org/view/6eea00db
Apr 10 18:23:19 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], i just install skype with snap and is working ok here
Apr 10 18:23:46 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: did you test your mic and webcam?
Apr 10 18:24:09 <mfilipe[m]>	they aren't communicating with pulseaudio here
Apr 10 18:24:10 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], yes just did it
Apr 10 18:24:24 <mfilipe[m]>	sounds like they are trying to communicate directly with alsa
Apr 10 18:24:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	mfilipe[m], sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 10 18:24:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	ledeni,  you as well please
Apr 10 18:26:12 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/5d0637e8
Apr 10 18:27:17 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: do you use a p2, usb or bluetooth headset?
Apr 10 18:28:01 <ledeni>	Southern_Gentlem, https://paste.centos.org/view/8a459e60
Apr 10 18:29:10 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], no just mic from laptop and integreted cam
Apr 10 18:30:08 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], how you install snap
Apr 10 18:30:24 <mfilipe[m]>	i checked the configs in flatpak and snap... flatpak gets the sound channels from pulseaudio properly but the snap package gets the audio cards from alsa
Apr 10 18:30:54 <whatnow111>	southern, it worked. thanks.
Apr 10 18:30:59 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: dnf install snapd && snap install skype
Apr 10 18:31:40 <mfilipe[m]>	actually i installed the snap package through the snap store
Apr 10 18:33:48 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], did you make syslink 'sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap'
Apr 10 18:34:30 <mfilipe[m]>	yep: lrwxrwxrwx.   1 root root      19 out 15 17:41 snap -> /var/lib/snapd/snap
Apr 10 18:37:31 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], when you run 'alsamixer' what is card
Apr 10 18:37:40 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: thank you very much for installing the packages to help me to troubleshooting this :)
Apr 10 18:37:45 <mfilipe[m]>	i see in your pastebin :)
Apr 10 18:38:20 <mfilipe[m]>	ledeni: it says PulseAudio
Apr 10 18:39:50 <mfilipe[m]>	i really believe this is a problem between snapd and fedora, and not a problem in the applications
Apr 10 18:40:32 <mfilipe[m]>	unfortunately i don't know how to dig more to report a bug to fedora yet :(
Apr 10 18:40:41 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], lol i just install skype and it is working
Apr 10 18:41:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	no you installed snap from outside of the repo
Apr 10 18:41:30 <mfilipe[m]>	Southern_Gentlem: really? oh shit, let me see
Apr 10 18:41:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	ledeni, installed from inside and its working so go remove the snap you installed and install the one from the fedora repo
Apr 10 18:42:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	<mfilipe[m]> actually i installed the snap package through the snap store
Apr 10 18:43:22 <mfilipe[m]>	that's odd... how could i install snapd outside of the fedora repo? hahaha
Apr 10 18:44:51 <mfilipe[m]>	https://paste.centos.org/view/9539e866
Apr 10 18:44:55 <mfilipe[m]>	it is installed from the fedora repo
Apr 10 18:45:56 <mfilipe[m]>	or maybe I didn't get the point of your question Southern_Gentlem
Apr 10 18:46:32 <mfilipe[m]>	fedora had removed the snap plugin from gnome-software (to be honest, an ego decision in my opinion)
Apr 10 18:47:10 <mfilipe[m]>	so i need the snap store to install the packages or install using the snap commandline
Apr 10 18:50:37 <mfilipe[m]>	let me try install through the skype snap using the commandline
Apr 10 18:56:53 <mfilipe[m]>	same problem
Apr 10 18:58:33 <mfilipe[m]>	but i found out a new stuff here... skype works when i use the mic (sux) and the speaker of my laptop
Apr 10 19:00:25 <mfilipe[m]>	if i move the input/output channel in pulseaudio, it didn't work... actually skype didn't change, it keeps using my sound card rather than the pulseaudio channels
Apr 10 19:00:26 <mfilipe[m]>	lol
Apr 10 19:00:43 <mfilipe[m]>	and the skype config shows the alsa cards and not the pulseaudio channels
Apr 10 19:01:09 <mixfix411>	your fedora is a usb edition?
Apr 10 19:01:32 <mfilipe[m]>	fedora 31 workstation running in ssd
Apr 10 19:02:26 <mixfix411>	your lsblk has all those loop devices howd you get taht
Apr 10 19:02:44 <mixfix411>	my normal fedora workstation only works with the traditional partition scheme
Apr 10 19:03:28 <mfilipe[m]>	mixfix411: snapd creates those loop devices (squashfs) for each application that i install
Apr 10 19:07:27 <mixfix411>	oh i see its a snap stuff
Apr 10 19:07:40 <mixfix411>	that's pretty cool
Apr 10 19:08:28 <ledeni>	mfilipe[m], do you have install 'pavucontrol'
Apr 10 19:08:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, so did you get figued out
Apr 10 19:08:59 <whatnow111>	southern, it worked.
Apr 10 19:09:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	what was the issue
Apr 10 19:09:40 <whatnow111>	but i doesn't seem to work with all programs.
Apr 10 19:10:31 <whatnow111>	well, the key is transmission itself is incomplete. you need to type -gtk with it.
Apr 10 19:10:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes

Apr 10 19:20:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	well why do you think that doesnt work
Apr 10 19:21:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program no the type
Apr 10 19:21:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program no the type of program
Apr 10 19:21:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	vi nano pluma etc
Apr 10 19:21:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	you have to type the name of the program not the type of program
Apr 10 19:22:54 <whatnow111>	i think it is the name of the program in manjaro. sorry to upset you. when i scrolled the mouse at the favorite bar on the left side of the screen, one of the apps there is called Text Editor.
Apr 10 19:23:48 <whatnow111>	let me reboot to fedora.
Apr 10 19:32:42 <whatnow111>	ok. officially using fedora.
Apr 10 19:33:14 <specing>	what now?
Apr 10 19:33:16 <whatnow111>	southern, text editor is the name of a program, no?
Apr 10 19:34:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	no thats a type of program
Apr 10 19:34:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf search "text editor"
Apr 10 19:34:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, what Desktop Environment are you using
Apr 10 19:35:05 <whatnow111>	gnome
Apr 10 19:36:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	the menus can say whatever it can be a type or the program name
Apr 10 19:36:40 <whatnow111>	ah, it's gedit in disguise.
Apr 10 19:36:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	bingo
Apr 10 19:38:21 <whatnow111>	but if you click show applications, it's not named as such.
Apr 10 19:39:16 <Khaytsus>	If you type "gedit" into gnome's search it doesn't come up?
Apr 10 19:40:07 <whatnow111>	nope.
Apr 10 19:40:08 <Khaytsus>	and had you done the smae with transmission, pretty sure it would have shown up in the menus....
Apr 10 19:40:11 <Khaytsus>	#doubt
Apr 10 19:40:14 *	Khaytsus installs Workstation
Apr 10 19:40:33 <whatnow111>	i can send you screenshot
Apr 10 19:40:40 <Khaytsus>	No thanks
Apr 10 19:40:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well the command is transmission-gtk but the menus show transmission
Apr 10 19:41:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, always remember the true power of the OS is in the commandline
Apr 10 19:42:38 <whatnow111>	southern, yes, it's very useful if you know how to harness it.
Apr 10 19:43:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111,  time in the seat you will learn
Apr 10 19:44:25 <Khaytsus>	whatnow111: If you type gedit in gnome, it comes up.  Period.
Apr 10 19:44:25 <whatnow111>	very cool. i've used it to reboot the computer and shut it down. i'm sure it can do much more.
Apr 10 19:45:14 <whatnow111>	khay, in the show applications area?
Apr 10 19:45:23 <Khaytsus>	...
Apr 10 19:45:34 <Khaytsus>	You click whatever at the top, type gedit, it comes up.
Apr 10 19:45:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	press f2
Apr 10 19:46:13 <Khaytsus>	"Activities" is what the text is, apparently...  had to look
Apr 10 19:46:31 <whatnow111>	ok. i searched gedit, but the app showing is text editor.
Apr 10 19:46:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	you type gedit and text editor appears
Apr 10 19:46:43 <Khaytsus>	good lord
Apr 10 19:47:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	which we already know it is correct
Apr 10 19:48:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the box you type "text" text editor and libreoffice-writer come up
Apr 10 19:49:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	whatnow111, why doesnt vim come up
Apr 10 19:49:46 <whatnow111>	it's part of the terminal?
Apr 10 19:50:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	close its a tui program not a gui program
Apr 10 19:50:55 <whatnow111>	ok. so tui programs are invisible from search.
Apr 10 19:50:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	terminal user interface vs graphics user interface
Apr 10 19:51:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 10 19:51:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	that application search yes
Apr 10 19:51:27 <whatnow111>	southern, how about hexchat? it didn't work.
Apr 10 19:51:38 <whatnow111>	from terminal.
Apr 10 19:53:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	does for me
Apr 10 19:54:05 <whatnow111>	did you have to quit hexchat first?
Apr 10 19:54:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Apr 10 19:54:35 <whatnow111>	ok. so you can't launch the app twice?
Apr 10 19:54:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	some apps you can, some you cant
Apr 10 19:56:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	and i advise to use hexchat && so it releases your terminal
Apr 10 19:57:47 <Khaytsus>	Or just run it in the gui, since it's a gui app..........
Apr 10 19:58:04 <whatnow111>	ah i see. that's what && is for? so that detaches the app from terminal once it's launched?
Apr 10 19:58:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	google
Apr 10 19:59:33 <Khaytsus>	Just & is sufficient btw..  && means if this command succeeds, run the next
Apr 10 20:00:53 <whatnow111>	ok. thanks for the lesson today. i appreciate it. good bye for now.
Apr 10 20:12:24 <mfilipe[m]>	basically fedora doesn't care about snapd: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=snapd&product=Fedora
Apr 10 20:12:27 <mfilipe[m]>	lol
Apr 10 20:12:54 <Khaytsus>	snap and flatpack are both utterly useless imo
Apr 10 20:14:23 <mfilipe[m]>	for me they are a revolution for the software vendors which want to offer support to linux
Apr 10 20:15:00 <Khaytsus>	Except they aren't in any way standalone..  they still depend on base libraries.  And if you don't have those libraries it won't work.
Apr 10 20:15:07 <Khaytsus>	So pointless.
Apr 10 20:16:04 <mfilipe[m]>	they are containers but for applications
Apr 10 20:16:15 <mfilipe[m]>	i love the container concept
Apr 10 20:16:38 <mfilipe[m]>	flatpak/snap are the docker for applications
Apr 10 20:16:58 <specing>	mfilipe[m]: they are just another distro
Apr 10 20:17:05 <specing>	you are putting a distro on top of your distro
Apr 10 20:17:10 <specing>	because you like distros
Apr 10 20:17:21 <specing>	and proprietary software vendors know that
Apr 10 20:18:03 <mfilipe[m]>	what is the problem about that? when you isolate an application, you improve security, build and install
Apr 10 20:18:21 <specing>	snap and flatpak aren't VMs
Apr 10 20:18:58 <mfilipe[m]>	exactly
Apr 10 20:19:51 <mfilipe[m]>	the unique problem that i see in the container concept is the storage
Apr 10 20:19:59 <mfilipe[m]>	naturally they consome more
Apr 10 20:20:02 <mfilipe[m]>	BUT
Apr 10 20:20:20 <mfilipe[m]>	storage is the cheapest hardware resource these days
Apr 10 20:20:44 <specing>	They aren't as secure as VMs
Apr 10 20:21:39 <mfilipe[m]>	specing: actually it is the same imo
Apr 10 20:21:52 <specing>	not even close
Apr 10 20:22:02 <jesse1010>	if I use a virtual connection in KVM through a 10gbe connection, will there be performance penalties vs pci passthrough of a 10gb nic?
Apr 10 20:22:07 <mfilipe[m]>	if you run a vm with privileged in the host, it won't be secure for your host
Apr 10 20:22:10 <specing>	I don't trust containers with security, too much code is involved for that
Apr 10 20:22:10 <jesse1010>	how much of one if so
Apr 10 20:22:47 <mfilipe[m]>	the same for flatpak/snap... if the dev doesn't configure the container in an isolate mode, it won't be secure for the host
Apr 10 20:23:19 <specing>	I'm telling you that it won't be secure even if you configure it in "isolate mode", whatever that is
Apr 10 20:25:13 <mfilipe[m]>	isolate mode means that the services inside of the container can't communicate with the host, except through proxies
Apr 10 20:27:32 <specing>	mfilipe[m]: and what would those proxies be?
Apr 10 20:27:53 <specing>	It's shared kernel. They can't do anything without talking to the host
Apr 10 20:28:44 <mfilipe[m]>	snap/flatpak, for example, you can communicate with wayland if your application uses the wayland proxy
Apr 10 20:29:10 <mfilipe[m]>	but they can't communicate directly, except if they aren't running in an isolate mode
Apr 10 20:29:54 <specing>	Great, so these proxies increase attack surface even more than using plain lxc with vnc?
Apr 10 20:29:56 <specing>	What a great idea
Apr 10 20:30:48 <mfilipe[m]>	i don't know what you mean by attack surface
Apr 10 20:30:55 <mfilipe[m]>	in this context
Apr 10 20:31:08 <specing>	As you said, storage is cheap these days and thus ther is nothing to be lost by going the VM route
Apr 10 20:32:58 <mfilipe[m]>	probably not but it's much easier to run a distro using docker than a vm
Apr 10 20:33:11 <mfilipe[m]>	$ docker run -it distro-name bash
Apr 10 20:33:35 <mfilipe[m]>	$ configure vm && start vm && connect to vm
Apr 10 20:34:19 <specing>	I rather put in some more work up-front than deal with the fallout of a security breach later on
Apr 10 20:34:49 <specing>	Fedora has an automated installer, which I'm learning to use right now (kickstart files)
Apr 10 20:35:15 <specing>	thus creating VMs should be as simple as creating containers, once the kickstart file is written
Apr 10 20:35:42 <dowdle>	specing: There is also virt-builder.
Apr 10 20:36:00 <plundra>	Cloud images \o/
Apr 10 20:36:34 <plundra>	Haven't tried with Fedora yet, but with Ubuntu I booted, inited, rebooted within <20 seconds.
Apr 10 20:36:35 <mfilipe[m]>	i don't know which kind of security you are trying to achieve but docker is already very well tested in the market  to have these "security breaches" that you are talking about
Apr 10 20:36:48 <specing>	is it?
Apr 10 20:37:07 <specing>	I'm yet to see bigger hosting companies offer LXC/Docker virtualisation and they actually have paid security experts on staff
Apr 10 20:37:09 <mfilipe[m]>	is it not?
Apr 10 20:38:08 <mfilipe[m]>	anyway, vm and docker are different concepts
Apr 10 20:38:12 <mfilipe[m]>	you can use both, depends of the problem you have to solve
Apr 10 20:40:58 <Pie-jacker875>	new firefox changes suck balls, how should I go about reverting? install old package?
Apr 10 20:41:17 <Pie-jacker875>	find changes and recompile without them?
Apr 10 20:42:18 <dowdle>	Pie-jacker875: You talking about in Firefox 75?
Apr 10 20:42:23 <Pie-jacker875>	yeah
Apr 10 20:42:36 <Pie-jacker875>	I don't want single click on address bar to highlight the whole thing
Apr 10 20:42:59 <Pie-jacker875>	it's a pointless change in behavior as far as I'm concerned and it's annoying
Apr 10 20:44:06 <mfilipe[m]>	Pie-jacker875: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/266888/can-i-force-dnf-to-install-an-old-version-of-a-package
Apr 10 20:44:26 <mfilipe[m]>	use the reference there to firefox-74
Apr 10 20:44:36 <specing>	Pie-jacker875: it's probably burried in about:config
Apr 10 20:44:55 <Pie-jacker875>	specing: I've spent several minutes looking for it, as well as reading through the reddit thread of people complaining
Apr 10 20:45:06 <Pie-jacker875>	seems like they've removed the option for it in about:config
Apr 10 20:45:28 <specing>	if you want to really fix firefox, youhave to revert to before webextensions :)
Apr 10 20:45:43 <mfilipe[m]>	Pie-jacker875: probably in #fx-desktop-community:mozilla.org they can help you to configure the new version to work the way you expect
Apr 10 20:46:05 <Pie-jacker875>	is that a matrix channel?
Apr 10 20:46:11 <mfilipe[m]>	yep
Apr 10 20:46:15 <Pie-jacker875>	cool, heading there no
Apr 10 20:46:16 <Pie-jacker875>	now
Apr 10 21:22:16 <srbaker>	Heya folks. For some reason I can't join #fedora-cloud from polari, so I'll just ask here: is there a non-standard username in the AWS images for Fedora Server?
Apr 10 21:22:25 <srbaker>	I'm getting permission denied when I try to ssh as root@ per AWS' instructions
Apr 10 21:23:46 <mfilipe[m]>	did you try ec2-user?
Apr 10 21:24:04 <mfilipe[m]>	probably it's better to ask this in ##aws
Apr 10 21:25:06 <srbaker>	I've tried root, admin (which is what it is on debian images), ec2-user, and fedora because I ran out of ideas.
Apr 10 21:25:41 <bugs_>	i think aws provides you with a key to use so you ssh -i key host
Apr 10 21:25:53 <srbaker>	Yes, I am using that key.
Apr 10 21:26:12 <mfilipe[m]>	but he doesn't know which user to use
Apr 10 21:26:30 <bugs_>	ssh -i ec2-one.pem ec2-user@host
Apr 10 21:26:57 <srbaker>	Yes. That does not work. That's why I'm here.
Apr 10 21:31:53 <bugs_>	srbaker:  two more things to check that i can think of
Apr 10 21:32:45 <bugs_>	chmod 600 keyfile - in case the permissions are dangerous
Apr 10 21:32:56 <bugs_>	and second if you downloaded the key file with windows it may need dos2unix
Apr 10 21:33:01 <srbaker>	Got it, thanks. It's fedora.
Apr 10 21:33:07 <srbaker>	I typo'd when I tried fedora.
Apr 10 21:33:09 <srbaker>	Thanks
Apr 10 21:33:38 <Khaytsus>	I wish they'd just stick to ec2-user
Apr 10 21:46:42 <whatnow111>	hello. can someone help me with video card issue? it's not a big one. the problem is after the computer wakes up, the screen looked washed up with purplish tint.
Apr 10 22:00:38 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, I prefer cloud-user - not AWS specific ec2-user
Apr 10 22:00:51 <plarsen>	But I would like consistency too

Apr 11 00:08:28 <Egyptian>	hey there - is it safe to disable and/or uninstall dnsmasq on my laptop? i didnt install it
Apr 11 00:10:08 <Sokel>	it's likely safe to remove.
Apr 11 00:13:48 <Khaytsus>	It's default and used by default, but sure, do whatever you like to your own system.  Just don't ask us when dns resolution doens't work, it'll be on you ;)
Apr 11 00:14:17 <Egyptian>	Khaytsus: its a dhcp and dns server .. however .. is some other software using it?
Apr 11 00:14:35 <Khaytsus>	...  "it is used by default"
Apr 11 00:15:27 <Egyptian>	default ? used by what ? trying to figure things out .. i wan to install a dns server and i saw the port being used
Apr 11 00:16:05 <wwalker>	Egyptian: could be installed by a virtual machine/container application.  Why do you want to remove it?  Is it causing a problem?
Apr 11 00:16:21 <Egyptian>	i want to replace it with nxfilter
Apr 11 00:26:56 <wwalker>	Egyptian: systemctl status dnsmasq   is it running?  On my machines, it is installed but not running
Apr 11 00:28:14 <Egyptian>	hmm.. research shows that i can have dnsmasq point to a different dns server - will give that a try .. thank you
Apr 11 00:28:24 <Egyptian>	wwalker: yes its running
Apr 11 00:28:54 <wwalker>	does it show enabled?
Apr 11 00:29:02 <Egyptian>	and yes i have a huge list of dependencies like virt* and cockpit  and their dependencies
Apr 11 00:29:08 <Egyptian>	yes its enabled
Apr 11 00:30:39 <wwalker>	look in /etc/dnsmasq.d  if there are files there then see what installed them :  rpm -qf /etc/dnsmasq.d/foo.conf
Apr 11 00:31:09 <wwalker>	oh, missed your dependencies post
Apr 11 00:32:43 <wwalker>	Egyptian: are you using virtual machines or cockpit
Apr 11 00:33:37 <cantstanya>	if you're using libvirt with the default bridge interface that will use dnsmasq.
Apr 11 00:34:09 <cantstanya>	but it shouldn't overlap you using another dns cache/server if you plan accordingly.
Apr 11 00:34:26 <daniel-wtd>	Egyptian: you can find out which installed packages is a dependency from another installed package via "rpm -q --whatrequires package_name". For dnsmasq, at least podman-plugins and afaik some libvirt is depending on dnsmasq.
Apr 11 00:35:37 <cantstanya>	also, iirc, libvirt doesn't use dnsmasq as a systemd service, it executes the program and monitors the process on its own.
Apr 11 00:36:30 <daniel-wtd>	same for podman afaik
Apr 11 00:37:01 <cantstanya>	and it's bound to the private network gateway address, so it REALLY shouldn't interfere with anything unless you don't plan accordingly.
Apr 11 00:37:16 <cantstanya>	in libvirt's case iirc the default is 192.168.122.1
Apr 11 00:37:51 <cantstanya>	if you use something else expecting it to listen on all interfaces, well that was an error in planning.
Apr 11 00:55:57 <Egyptian>	i am using both cockipt and libvirt as well as docker - this machine is like my home server where i throw everythign on it .. i guess its began to complain :rofl:
Apr 11 00:58:06 <guiekguiek>	Has anyone had issues with conflicting packages for virtualbox when upgrading to fedora 32?
Apr 11 01:00:40 <Sokel>	How and where did you install virtualbox from?
Apr 11 01:02:15 <guiekguiek>	using virtualbox's repo from their website

Apr 11 09:10:55 <ledeni>	indr, once you remove kernel did you update grub via 'grub2-mkconfig'
Apr 11 09:12:46 <indr>	Oh right. Three options show up there
Apr 11 09:13:22 <indr>	I thought when I dnf update my system that grub2-mkconfig command would be called and hence my grub config updated accordingly
Apr 11 09:14:17 <ledeni>	indr, how many kernel show 'rpm -qa kernel'
Apr 11 09:14:28 <indr>	Three
Apr 11 09:15:40 <ledeni>	indr,ok witch system you have uefi of bios
Apr 11 09:15:48 <indr>	uefi
Apr 11 09:16:07 <indr>	I think (I'm sorry)
Apr 11 09:16:40 <indr>	Btw thank you very much for helping me!
Apr 11 09:18:34 <ledeni>	indr, uefi --> run 'grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg' bios --> run 'grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg'
Apr 11 09:18:59 <indr>	Great. Thank you
Apr 11 09:19:17 <indr>	What are /etc/grub/grub2.cfg and /etc/grub/grub2-efi.cfg files for?
Apr 11 09:26:37 <ledeni>	indr, best check with 'google'
Apr 11 09:42:26 <indr>	ledeni, allright, just sym links, thank you very much!
Apr 11 09:43:11 <indr>	What scares me about these cfg files is that the newly generate files are significantly different from the old ones?
Apr 11 09:52:02 <indr>	I'm not doing anything here, lol
Apr 11 10:40:03 <sincorchetes>	Morning
Apr 11 10:53:14 <drOdo>	hi
Apr 11 10:53:30 <drOdo>	cannot boot fedora 31 after today update
Apr 11 10:54:10 <drOdo>	"System BootOrder not found. Initializing defaults."
Apr 11 10:55:04 <drOdo>	anyone can help pls?
Apr 11 11:12:17 <drOdo>	exactly as this https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business4/uploads/askfedora/original/2X/f/f8f58d9127f510fd04186c6ee98e7e143f53c715.jpeg
Apr 11 11:42:43 <drOdo>	i have managed to manually boot from \EFI\fedora\grubx64.efi
Apr 11 11:43:30 <drOdo>	dnf history info on last upgrade shows some errors for package grub2
Apr 11 12:08:57 <drOdo>	ok, posted the bug to bugzilla
Apr 11 13:53:42 <miscing>	Hi, anyone have idea of a package that depends on a lot of the kf5 utilities? I've looked at what they all depend on all but dnf only answers each other, and I can't figure out why they're installed on my system given that I don't have plasma. I also checked the groups installed and don't see groups that would install them
Apr 11 13:54:31 <miscing>	I ran 'dnf repoquery --whatdepends $package' on each of the kf5 packages

Apr 11 14:11:59 <jgjorgji>	anyone have an idea why gnome-desktop3 is pulled in when i'm upgrading the kde spin f31-f32 ?
Apr 11 14:16:50 <M_aD>	jgjorgji: #fedora-kde is the official spin support channel, maybe they can help you there
Apr 11 14:21:12 <miscing>	quick question, what's the rpmfusion-*-source repositories for?
Apr 11 14:23:53 <Khaytsus>	miscing: the source rpms, just like every other repo
Apr 11 14:26:08 <miscing>	khaytsus: Why are the source repos disabled by default? Also pardon my ignorance but what's the difference between source rpm's and say the 'fedora' repo rpm's?
Apr 11 14:31:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing,  you build the rpm from the srpms you dont need them unless you are going to do a custom build of a package
Apr 11 14:32:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing,  do you really want the extra 500G of space taken up on your machine for nothing ?
Apr 11 14:34:16 <miscing>	Southern_Gentlem: thanks, is there somewhere a description of repositories and what they're for? best I found was https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/repositories/ and it's not very useful. For example i'm also wondering about the modular repo
Apr 11 14:34:21 <Khaytsus>	miscing: fedora's source rpm repos are also disabled by default
Apr 11 14:34:41 <Khaytsus>	https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/
Apr 11 14:35:14 <miscing>	Khaytsus thanks!
Apr 11 14:35:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	miscing, a repopository of software
Apr 11 14:36:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	i advise staying away from modulars for now
Apr 11 14:36:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	i disable the modules and modules-updates repos on my machines
Apr 11 14:37:00 <Khaytsus>	Well, modular lets you install different versions of software at once.  Not something most users need
Apr 11 14:38:03 <miscing>	aight thanks that cleared it all up. I'll disable them, but good to know for future use
Apr 11 14:42:51 <mpduty>	#chair
Apr 11 15:06:54 <akdev>	question: why does DNF/YUM check for UID==0 ? I want to use it to build container images like `yum install --installroot=/home/me/images/mycontainer --releasever=/ install httpd` but it won't work as non-root
Apr 11 15:07:37 <kb1000>	you can probably disable that, check its docs
Apr 11 15:09:18 <akdev>	I've looked but found nothing
Apr 11 15:09:54 <akdev>	the source code suggests it cannot be disabled: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf/blob/master/dnf/cli/commands/install.py#L64
Apr 11 15:10:28 <akdev>	I'm trying to build dnf to see if I can patch it out but the instructions in the README don't work for me either...
Apr 11 15:12:02 <kb1000>	what was the exact error message it prints then again? I don't currently have my fedora machine running
Apr 11 15:12:36 <akdev>	Error: This command has to be run with superuser privileges (under the root user on most systems).
Apr 11 15:18:09 <kb1000>	you should request that feature then if you need it
Apr 11 15:20:45 <akdev>	I'd rather implement it myself and send a PR, if I could figure out how to build DNF
Apr 11 15:31:16 <jidar>	what would be the reason that my password prompt takes almost a minute to load after typing in my user?
Apr 11 15:31:24 <jidar>	I checked nssswitch.conf, looks fine
Apr 11 15:33:50 <kb1000>	akdev: what of the build doesn't work for you then?
Apr 11 15:45:05 <akdev>	kb1000, installing dependencies
Apr 11 15:45:37 <akdev>	the latest commit on the master branch requires a newer version of python3-libdnf than what is available in F31
Apr 11 15:45:49 <akdev>	going back to the release that my system is using works
Apr 11 15:46:23 <akdev>	I was going to try a rawhide container next but I have somehow broken podman
Apr 11 15:47:10 <kb1000>	well...
Apr 11 15:51:55 <akdev>	rootless podman is finicky... rawhide container works
Apr 11 16:11:16 <Khaytsus>	akdev: rootless podman is finicky how?
Apr 11 16:12:42 <kb1000>	hmm
Apr 11 16:23:44 <Khaytsus>	Hmm, Plex seems to work in podman on F31 now, it didn't before although don't recall what the failure was
Apr 11 16:24:09 <nocnoc>	0/ test-images are signed for secur boot?
Apr 11 16:35:53 <akdev>	Khaytsus, it requires setting up the /etc/suduid and /etc/subgid correctly so I can have write access into my user files
Apr 11 16:36:09 <akdev>	can't do podman-in-podman yet
Apr 11 16:36:30 <Khaytsus>	akdev: Sure, but that happens automatically since like F29.  If your system was upgraded from there you would just have to edit the files yourself.
Apr 11 16:36:36 <Khaytsus>	No idea about nesting podman.
Apr 11 16:37:01 <akdev>	my system was a clean F31, I don't think it happened automatically
Apr 11 16:37:49 <akdev>	I mean it would work by default but it would map my root user in the container to some UID in a high range
Apr 11 16:38:37 <akdev>	so I couldn't just do `podman -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD fedora:latest` and have it work
Apr 11 16:39:12 <Khaytsus>	k..   tbh I have no idea how the mapping works, but I know on new installs it will map all new users (and any added later) with like user:1000000:65536
Apr 11 16:39:28 <Khaytsus>	Try the :Z flag for volumes?  Sure it wasn't just selinux?
Apr 11 16:39:34 <Khaytsus>	I had to add :Z to all of my volumes
Apr 11 16:41:13 <akdev>	I don't think it was SELinux, I was running in permissive mode and I did add an selinux fcontext rule to add the files and relabeled properly before enabling enforcing mode
Apr 11 16:41:23 <akdev>	now I hit this:   Error processing tar file(exit status 1): there might not be enough IDs available in the namespace (requested 192:192 for /run/systemd/netif): lchown /run/systemd/netif: invalid argument
Apr 11 16:42:27 <akdev>	no clue what that's about, I think I broke it when playing with /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, I repaired the files but the error still happens
Apr 11 16:42:30 *	akdev shrugs
Apr 11 16:48:29 <akdev>	reboot fixed it
Apr 11 18:06:52 <mr_johnson22[m]>	hi, does anyone know which flatpak apps (if any) use the webcam portal? as opposed to full /dev/ access?
Apr 11 18:13:49 <kk4ewt>	mr_johnson22[m]; sorry i dont use flatpaks period
Apr 11 18:25:33 <openface>	As per the planned schedule, the final production version of Fedora 32 is scheduled for release on April 21, 2020
Apr 11 18:25:46 <openface>	i am with 31
Apr 11 18:26:44 <openface>	maybe will be terrible idea to upgrade it from console or auto-update by graphical UI becouse will be fail like many things/versions to this time of meaning
Apr 11 18:27:07 <openface>	so all data gone if you want to upgrade by one-to-one
Apr 11 18:27:13 <openface>	:{}
Apr 11 18:27:33 <openface>	:'((
Apr 11 18:35:42 <mr_johnson22[m]>	is there a problem with f31/32 in particular that would make upgrading a bad idea? or is that just a general comment about distro updates :P
Apr 11 18:43:08 <linuxmodder>	mr_johnson22[m], to my knowledge the all use /dev/XXX
Apr 11 18:43:36 <linuxmodder>	is there a need for not using cheese   or similar as packaged in fedora repos
Apr 11 18:44:28 <kk4ewt>	linuxmodder; only one reason for flatpak is skype
Apr 11 18:44:59 <linuxmodder>	skype should burn a fiery death imo but okay I'll agree there
Apr 11 18:45:22 <mr_johnson22[m]>	linuxmodder, i'm just curious is all. Writing a report on android security and i'd like to compare how android & flatpak handle dynamic camera access
Apr 11 18:45:27 <kk4ewt>	openface;  yes you can upgrade now (recommended is the commandline method) and you will be on f32 when it releases (i think that is your question)
Apr 11 18:46:58 <linuxmodder>	mr_johnson22[m], major differnces and I'd even argue not worth a peaches to oranges comparision mobile linux (android/ios) is a whole different animal
Apr 11 18:47:44 <sdgathman>	Why is testing in a VM helpful for test day?  Wouldn't all VMs be the same, and covered by automated regression testing?
Apr 11 18:48:02 <sdgathman>	Obviously, testing on a variety of weird hardware is needed.
Apr 11 18:48:07 <mr_johnson22[m]>	linuxmodder, alright, thanks
Apr 11 18:48:41 <linuxmodder>	not really sdgathman  some have compat issues and configurations
Apr 11 18:48:54 <kk4ewt>	sdgathman; as in #fedora-qa
Apr 11 18:53:45 <pefi>	[Fedora 31,] I have problem with jami (https://jami.net, it's not in fedora repos yet) showing some unexpected error on my laptop. I did a test in virtual machine - jami works fine. So I need to verify my main system. rpm -Va doesn't show anything interesting )ot I don't understand it). The error is related to Qt - is there a way of veryfying that Qt installation is OK or even better resetting all Qt setting to defult values?
Apr 11 18:56:52 <kk4ewt>	pefi;  sorry i am not installing that to help you troubleshoot
Apr 11 18:57:11 <kk4ewt>	first thing i would try is creating a new user and test in that
Apr 11 18:57:51 <kk4ewt>	it will never be in the fedora repos becasue they have hard coded the codecs which are not allowed in fedora
Apr 11 18:58:37 <Gestra_>	spelling out that "some unexpect error" would probably help in solving the problem
Apr 11 18:58:54 <pefi>	kk4ewt, thanks :-) I tested new user - didn't fly. I did local build - no go, I checked the code - looks like Qt wants to show an error and complains about fonts.
Apr 11 18:59:46 <kk4ewt>	#fedora-kde might can help
Apr 11 18:59:49 <pefi>	Gestra_, thanks for interes :-) [SIGABRT] QFontDatabase: Must construct a QGuiApplication before accessing QFontDatabase.  full report here: https://git.jami.net/savoirfairelinux/ring-lrc/issues/428
Apr 11 18:59:53 <linuxmodder>	pefi,  uses hardcoded codecs as kk4ewt  stated already better luck asking in that dev groups irc channel

Apr 11 19:01:20 <linuxmodder>	ah thought that sounded familiar that broke in the 28/29 cycle and the old maintainer (in copr iirc )  ran from it like the black plague
Apr 11 19:01:25 <linuxmodder>	pefi, ^
Apr 11 19:01:38 <linuxmodder>	might try the snapd or flatpak for ring
Apr 11 19:02:27 <pefi>	linuxmodder, interesting idea... thanks! I'll be back!
Apr 11 19:03:08 <linuxmodder>	be advised nothign of those are fully supported here but they are use at your own risk options
Apr 11 19:03:43 <linuxmodder>	supported as in non fedora repos aspect ( ask the respective projects with issues/bugs)
Apr 11 19:04:00 <pefi>	kk4ewt, do you have any info about those hard-coded codecs? I don't like that :-/
Apr 11 19:04:21 <linuxmodder>	pefi,  you have the gitlab repo it's in the readme unless they moved it
Apr 11 19:04:42 <pefi>	linuxmodder,  thanks!
Apr 11 19:04:45 <linuxmodder>	but ring has been  hard-coded for some time
Apr 11 19:06:20 <linuxmodder>	just my personal opinion if the OTR aspect is your thing try another client like pidgin or *tox
Apr 11 19:07:05 <linuxmodder>	*tox at least uses stuff from the supported 3rd party rpmfusion
Apr 11 19:08:19 <linuxmodder>	pefi, i.e. https://fedora.pkgs.org/31/rpmfusion-free-x86_64/qtox-1.16.3-2.20191018gita44cce6.fc31.x86_64.rpm.html
Apr 11 19:08:38 <pefi>	linuxmodder, I guess conversations with my mother in law doesn't need anything special, but I'm advertising jami as good open source stuff. I need to re-think it.
Apr 11 19:09:03 <linuxmodder>	qtox is also opensource and does not have hard coded codecs
Apr 11 19:09:40 <linuxmodder>	pefi, https://github.com/qTox/qTox/blob/master/INSTALL.md#fedora-easy
Apr 11 19:09:57 <pefi>	thanks!

Apr 11 19:27:01 <kk4ewt>	gambl0re;  because you need the full filename

Apr 11 19:29:35 <gambl0re>	dowdle: that rpm command returns nothing
Apr 11 19:30:02 <linuxmodder>	gambl0re,  you have installed libreoffice yes? or is this gnome where it was preinstalled at install
Apr 11 19:30:30 <linuxmodder>	gambl0re,  does which libreoffice return anything
Apr 11 19:30:42 <gambl0re>	linuxmodder: it was already preinstalled with the distro

Apr 11 19:32:03 <dowdle>	gambl0re: If from packages, I'm guessing you typed it wrong.
Apr 11 19:32:16 <kk4ewt>	then ooffice will work from the cli
Apr 11 19:32:25 <gambl0re>	is fpaste supposed to be slow?

Apr 11 19:37:23 <kk4ewt>	gambl0re;  open a terminal and type ooffice & what happens
Apr 11 19:37:48 <gambl0re>	i tried ooffice, loffice, libreoffice and none of them worked. "command not found"
Apr 11 19:38:08 <tnelis>	@gambl0re: you can also use xdg-open directly on your documents from the terminal; that's usually what you actually want to do. that'll open libreoffice if appropriate.
Apr 11 19:38:25 <kk4ewt>	what DE are you using
Apr 11 19:38:28 <gambl0re>	kde
Apr 11 19:38:56 <pefi>	gamblOre, what do you see after "which ooffice"?
Apr 11 19:39:16 <gambl0re>	oh wow. xdg-open worked.
Apr 11 19:39:20 <gambl0re>	tnelis: thanks
Apr 11 19:39:25 <kk4ewt>	linuxmodder;  boot the kde respin and see if if libreoffice is installed
Apr 11 19:40:55 <gambl0re>	just looked at the man pages for xdg-open. i shouldve been using this command from the start..
Apr 11 19:45:21 <dowdle>	xdg-open - opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application
Apr 11 19:45:51 <dowdle>	gambl0re: but oowriter should work just fine.
Apr 11 19:46:14 <dowdle>	gambl0re: For me xdg-open opens Textmaker (because that is what is set as my default word processor)

Apr 11 19:49:57 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Maybe zsh doesn't have /usr/bin/ in it's path?
Apr 11 19:50:08 <dowdle>	gambl0re: ls -lh /usr/bin/oo*
Apr 11 19:51:06 <gambl0re>	ls: cannot access '/usr/bin/oo*': No such file or directory
Apr 11 19:53:16 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Does "flatpak list" show libreoffice?
Apr 11 19:53:23 <linuxmodder>	it does dowdle:  echo $PATH on my zsh /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/home/linuxmodder/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/var/lib/snapd/snap/bin
Apr 11 19:54:04 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: Well, with snap in there, it's probably a snap package.
Apr 11 19:54:59 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: Or sorry... that's YOUR system.
Apr 11 19:55:15 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: And just because you have something in your path doesn't mean everyone else does. :P~
Apr 11 19:55:58 <linuxmodder>	nonsense I never do anything custom :P
Apr 11 19:56:28 <dowdle>	Ok, I think the mystery is solved.  The KDE Plasma spin DOES NOT have Libreoffice installed.  Period.  It ships with the Caligra office applications.
Apr 11 19:57:46 <dowdle>	gambl0re: My guess is that xdg-open $documentfile is giving you Calligra Words.
Apr 11 19:58:02 <linuxmodder>	what dowdle  said my system was just being slow
Apr 11 19:58:35 <linuxmodder>	sudo dnf install libreoffice-writer OR libreoffice-core whichever floats thy boat best
Apr 11 19:59:03 <linuxmodder>	core is the basics including the excel and ppt variants in libreoffice
Apr 11 20:02:31 <gambl0re>	dowdle: it shows libreoffice on my computer
Apr 11 20:04:04 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Show me a screenshot?  If it is there, you installed it as it is NOT part of the stock KDE Plasma spin... and since the binaries aren't /usr/bin/oo* it wasn't installed with regular rpm packages but either Flatpak or Snap... or something else.
Apr 11 20:05:48 <gambl0re>	dowdle: https://i.imgur.com/dICxCvk.jpg
Apr 11 20:05:52 <gambl0re>	convinced?
Apr 11 20:06:01 <tnelis>	it's likely via flatpak, on my system it doesn't put it in PATH and the XDG app uses flatpak-run
Apr 11 20:06:30 <dowdle>	tnelis: As previously said, xdg-opens whatever your default application is defined for the given document type.
Apr 11 20:06:57 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Yes, and I already mentioned how it got there. :)
Apr 11 20:07:34 <dowdle>	gambl0re: So, the question is, and I don't care if you answer or not... was it installed via flatpak or snap or some other method (like a .tar.gz|xz)?
Apr 11 20:08:03 <gambl0re>	im pretty sure it was installed when i installed the distro
Apr 11 20:08:13 <gambl0re>	i cant remember to be honest..
Apr 11 20:08:18 <tnelis>	@gambl0re: type flatpak run org.libreoffice.LibreOffice to confirm it works via flatpak or not
Apr 11 20:08:43 <gambl0re>	guys it's fine....xdg-open works perfectly.
Apr 11 20:08:48 <gambl0re>	thanks for the help
Apr 11 20:09:55 <dowdle>	gambl0re: If you installed from Fedora F31 GA KDE Plasma media or respin media... it doesn't included LibreOffice.  I just verified that by booting an .iso in a KVM VM.
Apr 11 20:11:34 <gambl0re>	tnelis: it works with that command. so i mustve installed using flatpak.
Apr 11 20:12:18 <gambl0re>	maybe libreoffice comes preinstalled with ubuntu...
Apr 11 20:12:40 <whatnow111>	dowdle, do you use any other distro?
Apr 11 20:13:03 <dowdle>	whatnow111: CentOS, RHEL, and various others in VMs usually just trying to keep up.
Apr 11 20:13:30 <whatnow111>	i see. so basically derivatives of redhat?
Apr 11 20:13:39 <dowdle>	gambl0re: LibreOffice does come preinstalled on the GNOME spin... and maybe a few other spins, but not the KDE Plasma one.
Apr 11 20:14:01 <dowdle>	gambl0re: The reason for that is that KDE has their own office suite named Caligra so that's what they have pre-installed.
Apr 11 20:14:28 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Some of the spins/DEs aimed and lower resource usage might have GNUmeric and Abiword.
Apr 11 20:15:07 <gambl0re>	dowdle: so i have two text editors? libreoffice and caligra?
Apr 11 20:15:31 <gambl0re>	when search for caligra, no results found...
Apr 11 20:15:32 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Most likely.  They aren't "text editors" but yeah. :)
Apr 11 20:15:44 <dowdle>	gambl0re: I might not be spelling it wrong... and maybe you deleted it.
Apr 11 20:16:04 *	dowdle boots the KDE spin one-more-time;
Apr 11 20:17:23 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Or perhaps you used the netinstall media and picked stuff alacart.
Apr 11 20:18:07 <gambl0re>	i installed kde spin...
Apr 11 20:18:17 <gambl0re>	https://i.imgur.com/6fZcxwO.png
Apr 11 20:18:30 <gambl0re>	anyone know why the menu at the top is pixelated?
Apr 11 20:18:56 <gambl0re>	the icons for example are pixelated
Apr 11 20:19:58 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Calligra has two lls
Apr 11 20:20:12 <dowdle>	gambl0re: Here's a screengrab from the Live KDE media I just booted - https://www.montanalinux.org/files/fedora-31-kde-live-office-category-20200411.png
Apr 11 20:20:22 <gambl0re>	oh you're right. i do have calligra words installed
Apr 11 20:24:21 <dowdle>	gambl0re: It is pixelated (and it only seems to be a few icons) that's how the flatpak shipped it.  Generally flatpaks include everything they need or rely on one or more dependency framework flatpaks.
Apr 11 20:25:39 <dowdle>	gambl0re: My stock rpm-based libreoffice writer doesn't seem to have those few pixelated icons.
Apr 11 20:26:10 <dowdle>	gambl0re: It may also be a property of the icons / theme you are using?!?
Apr 11 20:26:47 *	dowdle gets ready to leave the lab dowdle was proctoring.  Later
Apr 11 20:27:37 <tnelis>	(no pixelated issue with flatpak install on my system either)
Apr 11 20:28:18 <tnelis>	gambl0re: look for HiDPI-related issues, that might be the keyword you're looking for
Apr 11 20:28:56 <gambl0re>	it could be because i increased the font-scaling on my computer
Apr 11 20:36:03 <CustosLimen>	ji
Apr 11 20:36:06 <CustosLimen>	hi
Apr 11 20:36:12 <CustosLimen>	I want a USB drive with persistence
Apr 11 20:36:22 <CustosLimen>	but livecd-iso-to-usb does not work that well
Apr 11 20:36:49 <CustosLimen>	If I just install fedora to the USB it should work, but I don't exactly want to boot a VM or something to do that
Apr 11 20:37:07 <specing>	Why not?
Apr 11 20:37:27 <specing>	booting a vm to do that is quite easy
Apr 11 20:41:18 <CustosLimen>	takes more time than just running a script
Apr 11 20:41:24 <CustosLimen>	and doing it over and over again is a bore
Apr 11 20:41:40 <CustosLimen>	I guess I can just try recall how to do a chroot install
Apr 11 20:43:51 <Mershl>	I'd like to use Gnome 3.36 but am usually careful with Beta release. When do you consider a new Fedora release as stable enough?
Apr 11 20:54:12 <tnelis>	Mershl: the current schedule is at https://fedorapeople.org/groups/schedule/f-32/f-32-key-tasks.html
Apr 11 21:15:03 <rdieter>	Mershl: depends on your definition of "stable enough".  One the conservative side, it's stable enough when it gets released (ie, all blocker bugs are resolved)
Apr 11 21:23:49 <openface>	mr_johnson22[m]: this is not funny, you cant upgrade fedora without failure, or use windows..
Apr 11 21:24:53 <whatnow111>	anyone used m.2 or pcie stick?
Apr 11 21:25:15 <[R]>	whatnow111: what's that?
Apr 11 21:25:32 <whatnow111>	storage device.
Apr 11 21:25:34 <[R]>	so cool
Apr 11 21:25:36 <[R]>	tell me more
Apr 11 21:26:00 <whatnow111>	i read that it's much faster than ssd.
Apr 11 21:26:05 <[R]>	NO WAY
Apr 11 21:27:05 <whatnow111>	it looks like a ram stick. just curious if anyone is using it now.
Apr 11 21:27:16 <[R]>	sounds pretty wicked
Apr 11 21:28:53 <whatnow111>	much faster yet just slightly more expensive. so it's kinda enticing.
Apr 11 21:30:04 <[R]>	very exciting

Apr 11 22:17:08 <wwalker>	for anyone interested in my cursor size problems, I finally found that, in xfce4-mouse-settings, I had the "default" Theme selected, and size set to 48 pixels.  Apparently, although it allows you to set the size, the "default" theme cursor is always 16 pixels.
Apr 11 22:18:56 <wwalker>	So, some apps, were using "default" while others were using other sursor settings (there are a myriad of places you can set the cursor).  firefox and chrome, were both using the xfce "default"
Apr 11 22:19:01 <wwalker>	I selected the only other theme "Adwaita"

Apr 12 00:22:17 <smurfendrek123>	Hi, i had java 14 installed, and then ran sudo dnf install java-13-openjdk, and then my java 14 (which came from the java-latest-openjdk package) turned into java 13 (which also came from the latest package). Is this because the java-latest version got downgraded in the repos of f32? Is this possible since f32 is still in beta?
Apr 12 00:24:48 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps it's a modular thing
Apr 12 00:26:12 <Sokel>	alternatives
Apr 12 00:27:04 <Khaytsus>	Yep, that's likely the way to flip between them
Apr 12 00:28:57 <tnelis>	to expand on what Sokel pointed out in case that wasn't clear, double-check `alternatives --display java`
Apr 12 00:41:54 <smurfendrek123>	@Sokel, yea i can switch with alternatives but 14 isn't available anymore
Apr 12 00:42:13 <smurfendrek123>	@Sokel, only 8 and 13, and i assume 11 if i would install it

Apr 12 01:28:58 <CustosLimen>	I can do it with dnsmasq but it is a bit of a hassle
Apr 12 01:34:46 <akdev>	what do you mean by manage?
Apr 12 01:43:10 <Sokel>	CustosLimen: if you mean manage as in, controlling the PXE menu, mac reservations, kickstarts, repos, etc, look into cobbler.
Apr 12 01:43:35 <CustosLimen>	I think I'm looking for something like MaaS or foreman
Apr 12 01:44:21 <CustosLimen>	seems cobbler may be it also
Apr 12 01:47:29 <akdev>	I am still confused about foreman vs katello vs cobbler
Apr 12 02:53:50 <Sokel>	akdev: katello is a life cycle management plugin for foreman. you use katello to manage machines, pull content repos, create subscriptions, etc.
Apr 12 02:54:03 <Sokel>	the repos are pulled in and managed via pulp.
Apr 12 02:55:29 <Sokel>	foreman, as a whole with its plugins, allows you to provision, config, monitor servers.
Apr 12 02:56:25 <Sokel>	All cobbler is for is automating network based installs.

Apr 12 15:30:57 <FixPleaseTo>	I don't feel good about grub2
Apr 12 15:31:34 <Khaytsus>	Bummer.
Apr 12 15:31:54 <FixPleaseTo>	this is one of the things about linux which I can't get past, I just can't - you read something today, and then tomorrow everything might change. and I mean little weird changes, that slip by your attention
Apr 12 15:32:53 <FixPleaseTo>	right now I renamed my swap partition, and it's in grub.cfg but it does not appear at boot time. I needa manually edit the vmlinuz line (what the hell's a linuz, anyway?)
Apr 12 15:34:32 <FixPleaseTo>	I was under the impression grub is a binary thingy which is driven by configuration commands in a plaintext file.  I ran grub2-mkconfig... what else is missing?
Apr 12 15:37:47 <FixPleaseTo>	in my spare time I thought a thing like computing can really benefit from speculative design, which accounts for future revision/expansion.  I'm not saying you break your head to make something, just don't make something for today, bc today's got only one place it can go!
Apr 12 15:39:27 <FixPleaseTo>	in the spirit of that, I'm going 2 spend my sunday re-learning grub from page 1 - I guess.  maybe I can beat it at its own icky game, or maybe I'll be booting with 'e' from this day on
Apr 12 15:41:53 <FixPleaseTo>	but what I won't do, by god, the next time around, is homebrew my own partition scheme.  vanilla all day long baby, or if it's an option, starch flavor!
Apr 12 15:43:16 <FixPleaseTo>	(this problem arose originally from my allocating a relatively small amount of disk space for my swap partition)

Apr 12 17:54:28 <minall>	Hello Fedora community!
Apr 12 17:56:19 <minall>	Fedora has support for some of my wifi drivers, from which some other 'libre' distros don't have... This apparently are called blobs, and they aren't open source. But Fedora does have support for this, does Fedora contain open source drivers for my wifi driver or is just that these 'libre' distros don't have enough support?
Apr 12 17:57:51 <rdieter>	minall: firmware is probably the difference
Apr 12 17:58:09 <minall>	rdieter: I'm reading about it, trying to understand what these 'blobs' are
Apr 12 17:58:40 <minall>	This of course affects experience since I need to use my wifi but, isn't fedora Open Source?
Apr 12 17:58:43 <rdieter>	minall: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing:Main#Binary_Firmware  hopefully that clarifies a bit.
Apr 12 17:59:02 <minall>	rdieter: Thanks, I'll read it and come here if there's any questions
Apr 12 17:59:04 <rdieter>	minall: opensource *software*, yes.  firmware policy is a bit more lenient
Apr 12 18:02:35 <minall>	rdieter: I see!, Fedora allows these binaries under some circumstances depending on licencing, that's fine
Apr 12 18:03:02 <minall>	But, are these binaries reversed engineered or checked?
Apr 12 18:07:04 <minall>	Since Fedora is an Open Source community, I want to know that these binaries don't contain harmful code
Apr 12 18:12:38 <FixPleaseTo>	have a good conclusion to your weekend, every1
Apr 12 18:13:16 <specing>	Hello
Apr 12 18:14:01 <specing>	Where is the documentation on the repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d?
Apr 12 18:14:57 <specing>	Specifically, how to change the urls. I see metalink urls, but I'm not sure... is one supposed to use the metalink keyword or something else when refering to a static web server directory?

Apr 12 19:01:46 <plarsen>	How is the "enterprise login" the live workstation image asks for on the first boot supposed to work?
Apr 12 19:02:08 <plarsen>	I find it's rather "dumb" and fails in my case because the hostname right after installation isn't set and isn't FQDN
Apr 12 19:02:27 <plarsen>	ipa-client-install right after setting the proper hostname works just fine
Apr 12 19:04:17 <dowdle>	plarsen: I believe that just lets you join a Microsoft AD domain.
Apr 12 19:04:54 <plarsen>	dowdle, ehhh no. Why in the WORLD would it try to do that? This is Linux?   It errors out that ipa-client-install failed - that's not AD
Apr 12 19:05:03 <dowdle>	plarsen: I've not really used that so I'm not positive.  I wonder if the install docs say.  I would hope so.
Apr 12 19:05:09 <plarsen>	Well it can be inddirectly if freeipa is setup to trust an AD - but that's pretty advanced
Apr 12 19:05:39 <dowdle>	plarsen: I bet you that there are more Linux hosts joined to MS AD than IPA.
Apr 12 19:05:45 <plarsen>	I'm just wondering why the hostname FQDN isn't part of the steps to join a newly installed fedora to IPA
Apr 12 19:06:11 <plarsen>	Ok - you go survey it and when you come back we can talk about how relevant that is.
Apr 12 19:06:12 <dowdle>	plarsen: You can set the hostname during the install.
Apr 12 19:06:30 <plarsen>	dowdle, nope - well, not the FQDN - hostname yes
Apr 12 19:06:43 <plarsen>	And it fails because FQDN isn't there (required)
Apr 12 19:06:56 <dowdle>	plarsen: I don't see a difference between the hostname and an FQDN.
Apr 12 19:10:27 <dowdle>	plarsen: Unfortunately the F31 Installation Guide shows F21 screenshots and doesn't mention the Enterprise Login thing at all. :(
Apr 12 19:10:31 *	dowdle checks RHEL documentation
Apr 12 19:15:44 <dowdle>	Not finding it mentioned there either.
Apr 12 19:18:01 <minall>	The download of the Fedora 32 ISO isn't working?
Apr 12 19:18:10 <minall>	Or is it me? https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/
Apr 12 19:18:25 <minall>	I'm trying to download the beta, but no luck
Apr 12 19:19:34 <minall>	I'm getting 404
Apr 12 19:19:47 <minall>	The's no problem with Fedora 31
Apr 12 19:20:55 <plarsen>	minall, try torrent.fedoraproject.org
Apr 12 19:22:26 <dowdle>	minall: The beta .iso link works for me.
Apr 12 19:23:14 <dowdle>	minall: Looks like the link gives a mirror that uses a mirrorlist so we most likely get different sites.
Apr 12 19:23:32 <minall>	dowdle: Oh, depending on the location
Apr 12 19:23:33 <dowdle>	minall: I can give you a direct URL if you want...
Apr 12 19:23:43 <minall>	Don't worry dowdle, I'm using torrent now
Apr 12 19:24:03 <plarsen>	dowdle, seems that the "enterprise login" isn't really used on the live image then.  Which leads me to think it should be removed as an option.
Apr 12 19:24:13 <plarsen>	It's very easy to setup once the system is installed anyway ...
Apr 12 19:24:46 <plarsen>	YEah - careful with mirrors - not every mirror is good at keeping their inventory consistent and up to date.
Apr 12 19:28:44 <minall>	btw, is redhat free? I wanted to give it a try but It seems they only give me 30 days of try but, what happends after those 30 days?
Apr 12 19:29:32 <[R]>	it self destructs
Apr 12 19:30:07 <dowdle>	plarsen: Looks like they were complaining about the Enterprise Login stuff back in 2013 - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=965888
Apr 12 19:32:44 <minall>	Lol
Apr 12 19:35:53 <mrhubrisje>	question, i was looking into transitioning from ubuntu to fedora and i've got fedora running in a VM. All is going fine but i was trying to customize my shell and wanted to install the extension user-theme. Problem is, it's already installed but gnome tweaks is not showing it ...
Apr 12 19:36:17 <mrhubrisje>	the interwebs aren't very helpful so i'm trying here
Apr 12 19:39:49 <mrhubrisje>	for clarity, it's Fedora Workstation with Gnome
Apr 12 19:40:15 <plarsen>	hehe
Apr 12 19:40:48 <plarsen>	minall, https://developers.redhat.com/topics/linux/
Apr 12 19:51:38 <greatgatsby>	Is RedHat/fedora going all-in with c# ?  I'm glad it's an open-source language, and .net core being cross-platform, just a little worried about having the rug pulled out from underneath it.
Apr 12 19:51:52 <Khaytsus>	greatgatsby: What makes you say anhting bout C#
Apr 12 19:51:57 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, what does "all in" mean?
Apr 12 19:52:01 <Khaytsus>	I don't know of any fedora tools offhnad that are C#
Apr 12 19:53:20 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, it is Microsoft who made dotNet core open source - they're maintaining it upstream. Not really something Red Hat controls. But you probably won't find anyone who thinks open sourcing dotNet was a bad idea.
Apr 12 19:54:55 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: My understanding is that Microsoft is phasing out the proprietary / Windows-only flavors of .Net in preference for the CORE version that is multiplatform.
Apr 12 19:55:08 <plarsen>	dowdle, +1 correct
Apr 12 19:55:28 <plarsen>	It's a different microsoft than 10 years ago, that's for sure.
Apr 12 19:56:11 <Khaytsus>	Considering how much MS profits off Linux these days of course they support some things in it
Apr 12 19:56:19 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: But yeah, Microsoft and Red Hat have quite a few collaborations... getting Windows to work well in KVM, getting Linux to work well in HyperV... Microsoft contributing to the Linux kernel, etc.  And Microsoft wants their development tools to work well on RHEL.
Apr 12 19:57:01 <Khaytsus>	And mark my word, 3 years we'll see a Windows desktop with Linux kernel.  I called it 5 years 2 years ago, so...  sticking with that timeline
Apr 12 19:57:27 <dowdle>	Windows these days is a hybrid with Linux... well, the Windows 10 2004 release has a Linux kernel included for Linux subsystem for Windows... and they are updating File Explorer so that it can read Linux filesystems.
Apr 12 19:57:58 <dowdle>	Khaytsus: Not 3 years from now... but RSN when 2004 is released to GA.
Apr 12 19:58:21 <dowdle>	Khaytsus: They don't use the Linux kernel for Windows... but for the Linux Subsystem for Windows.
Apr 12 19:58:27 <Khaytsus>	#soon
Apr 12 19:58:39 <dowdle>	Oh, I think I'm writing that backwards... the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
Apr 12 19:58:51 <dowdle>	Yeah, WSL 2 ships with a Linux kernel.
Apr 12 19:58:59 <Khaytsus>	Just wait.  3 years there will be a Windows desktop that uses the linux kernel
Apr 12 19:59:06 <[R]>	Khaytsus: you're a linux kernel
Apr 12 19:59:24 <dowdle>	Umm, and they have included OpenSSH client installed by default for several releases now, and OpenSSH server an be added easy in the "add Windows features" installer.
Apr 12 19:59:33 <[R]>	Khaytsus: i wonder how far they are into porting their graphical system onto the kernel already
Apr 12 20:05:59 <dowdle>	plarsen: Looks like the Enterprise Login feature is designed to work with IPA, LDAP, and AD.
Apr 12 20:06:55 <greatgatsby>	Khaytsus, plarsen dowdle:  Just followed the RHEL link that was posted, and reminded my that I see so much C# promoting from Red Hat.  Was just curious if this is part of a longer term strategy.
Apr 12 20:09:13 <plarsen>	greatgatsby, having C# on RHEL is a benefit to Red Hat - it breaks one of the last platform barriers. It's also why Microsoft is hard at work breaking the same barriers to Windows. Both sides want _all_ workloads to be compatible with their platform.
Apr 12 20:09:53 <plarsen>	There's a ton of dotNet out there in "enterprise land" and there's a ton of "lamp" and other stacks available that doesn't run on Windows (yet) - so yes, you'll find a lot of happy faces on both sides here seeing potentials
Apr 12 20:10:25 <greatgatsby>	plarsen, understood.  Please don't take my comments as anti C#.  I'm really just geniunely curious if there's a move away from Java and towards C#, where that type of language is appropriate.
Apr 12 20:10:53 <greatgatsby>	plarsen, for sure, I think it's great actually.
Apr 12 20:11:09 <plarsen>	Just know it's really driven by a huge change at Microsoft.  But don't be surprised that companies like Red Hat is all on board with the changes at Microsoft ....
Apr 12 20:12:01 <Pie-jacker875>	should I expect working kde wayland when I choose to update to fedora 32?
Apr 12 20:20:07 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: I doubt Red Hat is moving away from Java since a significant amount of their funds (I've heard, I have no real data) comes from the Java stuff they bought... I forget the name of it... and they maintain various Java versions after Oracle abandons them.
Apr 12 20:20:39 <greatgatsby>	dowdle, I see.  Thanks.
Apr 12 20:21:44 <dowdle>	greatgatsby: Perhaps my info is outdated... on this page (https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/) they have Jboss as retired.
Apr 12 20:28:22 <dowdle>	I think maybe they renamed the Java product line.
Apr 12 20:29:44 <dowdle>	Oh, and lots of other JBoss things on that same page that aren't retired.
Apr 12 20:30:27 <dowdle>	COBOL is where it is at for the moment. :)  Given that a lot of U.S. states have unemployment systems written in it.
Apr 12 20:31:50 <MICROburst>	Any walk-throughs for strongswan available? - filetree looks different and some file won't be found: https://paste.centos.org/view/ede053c6
Apr 12 20:45:32 <vbgunz>	hello all. I have an external disk luks encrypted. when I used to attach it to an older distro, it would unlock and follow my fstab to mount it automatically. I'm trying to do the same thing on Fedora 31. I have the right crypttab and key file (and entries in fstab) *but* plugging it in no longer automatically unlocks and mounts it. how can I troubleshoot this?
Apr 12 20:51:22 <Pie-jacker875>	vbgunz: I seem to recall there being something other than fstab where it needs to be, but maybe I'm mistaken
Apr 12 20:51:46 <Pie-jacker875>	perhaps I'm thinking of having it mount when you boot
Apr 12 20:52:49 <vbgunz>	it's an external disk. I have the correct crypttab entries along with the correct key. permissions 0600 and 0400 respectively. the entries in fstab are correct but doing a mount -a doesn't unlock and mount anything
Apr 12 20:53:12 <vbgunz>	I can do it manually but I liked just plugging  it in and it automatically unlocking and mounting
Apr 12 21:03:06 <vbgunz>	hmm.. it seems I have systemd-cryptsetup service files generated for these entries but I can't "enable" them. I get failed to enable unit ... is transient or generated. *but* starting the service file and then calling mount -a works a lot quicker than what I was manually doing
Apr 12 21:03:32 <vbgunz>	but how to make it even quicker (automatically do this after plugging in the external disk)?
Apr 12 21:13:53 <vbgunz>	I'll just settle on running it through a script but do very much appreciate the automatic version (no script)
Apr 12 23:32:57 <dtrainor>	Howdy.  I'm trying to figure out how to run a command after my system has been idle for X period of time.  There's a lot of really strange suggestions out there but it sounds like using dbus-monitor might be the best approach.  I'm not quite sure which data to interpret so that I can make this happen.  Anyone done this before?  Can you point me in the right direction?
Apr 12 23:33:23 <dtrainor>	I have a rack of lab hardware, I'd like to power a lot of it down if I walk away from my workstation for a few hours, power it back up when I return etc.
Apr 12 23:36:15 <dtrainor>	dbus and "Presence" seem to be the name of the game but I'm having trouble gluing these things together.
Apr 12 23:42:32 <CustosLimen>	hi
Apr 12 23:42:56 <CustosLimen>	is there some public smtp server that needs no auth that I can use for sending notifications
Apr 12 23:42:59 <CustosLimen>	like from dnf automatic
Apr 12 23:43:18 <vdamewood>	Probably not, that would quickly become a spam gateway.
Apr 12 23:45:49 <CustosLimen>	😭
Apr 12 23:50:53 <torbjorn>	CustosLimen: your isp might offer one
Apr 12 23:51:08 <torbjorn>	(that is limited to their customer network)
Apr 13 00:27:11 <CharlesIC>	hello, for some reason, the default video player in f31 doesnt open videos
Apr 13 00:27:14 <CharlesIC>	at least .webms
Apr 13 00:27:24 <CharlesIC>	so in cheese, if you click on it, it does nothing
Apr 13 00:27:25 <CharlesIC>	a video
Apr 13 00:27:40 <CharlesIC>	its totem
Apr 13 00:29:22 <CharlesIC>	if i do it from command line, it works - totem foo.webm, but not by clicking on it in the GUI, it just has a clock that moves forever
Apr 13 00:30:47 <CharlesIC>	yeah, it seems to crash
Apr 13 00:52:22 <plarsen>	CustosLimen, I'm sure old fashioned spammers would be thrilled if such a thing existed
Apr 13 02:32:44 <kk4ewt>	CharlesIC; sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 13 02:36:40 <CharlesIC>	kk4ewt, ok
Apr 13 02:36:48 <CharlesIC>	it does it for cheese to a degree also. i have to start cheese in a special way
Apr 13 02:36:52 <CharlesIC>	something with gnome apps for me

Apr 16 16:40:53 <specing>	matt3o12: you can copy the first 2MB (bootloader), then use fdisk to delete the partition table and add a new partition with the same number as on the old hdd but with new start-end sectors, then just dd fedora to that new partition
Apr 16 16:41:53 <matt3o12>	Do I also need the other drives? Like /boot/uefi/ and /boot/? Or is the lvm partion enough?
Apr 16 16:43:20 <matt3o12>	Or are the automatically regenerated?
Apr 16 16:44:49 <Khaytsus>	Fastest way would be a fresh install
Apr 16 16:45:20 <Khaytsus>	But yes if you're moving to a new drive you would need all of the partitions, such as boot, efi, etc
Apr 16 16:45:50 <matt3o12>	I think it would be faster to just copy everything (including windows), and then removing windows in my new drive and remove linux in my old
Apr 16 16:46:21 <Khaytsus>	You could do that I suppose.  And resize partitions, and resize filessytems, and fix stuff, and update fstab, etc.  Up to you :)
Apr 16 16:47:12 <matt3o12>	Where can I learn how to use fstab? I have never sued it before. Resizing the partiations should be easy enough in gnome right?
Apr 16 16:49:06 <Khaytsus>	No idea about 'gnome' but I imagine you'd use the partd guid
Apr 16 16:49:08 <Khaytsus>	gui..
Apr 16 16:57:42 <specing>	matt3o12: ah, I thought it was pre-UEFI. on UEFI my answer does not apply
Apr 16 16:58:15 <matt3o12>	yeah I am using UEFI
Apr 16 16:58:49 <Khaytsus>	Still say you could do a fresh install and migrate much faster
Apr 16 16:59:34 <Khaytsus>	4 days, 22 hours, 0 minutes, 8 seconds until the Fedora 32 (4/21/2020) release.
Apr 16 16:59:43 <matt3o12>	I honestly don't want to restore from a backup, that takes way longer (the hard drive is quite slow, maxes out at 40MB after 10min), meanwhile my ssd is at least 200MBs

Apr 16 23:09:44 <renich>	Fedora Core 1 x86_64 ?
Apr 16 23:09:47 <renich>	¬_¬
Apr 16 23:10:26 <cyveris>	Ah, FC1.
Apr 16 23:10:29 <cyveris>	Those were the days.
Apr 16 23:10:33 <renich>	... I wonder how do I get the mouse to work? in Fedora core 1...
Apr 16 23:10:42 <renich>	cyveris: yeah, I remember when I tried it for the first time.
Apr 16 23:10:57 <renich>	what I don't remember is x86_64 in FC1
Apr 16 23:11:16 <renich>	And, btw, the installation fails with x86_64. It only works with i386
Apr 16 23:19:25 <renich>	ha! mouse started working by removing the "tablet" device from the KVM/qemu guest. :D
Apr 16 23:29:22 <renich>	Fixed the repos. :D. Now, I am applying updates! Let's see how that goes...

Apr 17 09:57:03 <ledeni>	chilversc, using Kernel driver in use: nouveau for nvidia gpu driver is open source and sometime make glitches but if you want you can try nvidia driver from rpmfusion repos
Apr 17 10:00:17 <ledeni>	chilversc, check --> https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration  &  https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA?highlight=%28CategoryHowto%29
Apr 17 10:10:00 <chilversc>	ledeni: yeah, I was trying to avoid setting up prime, etc as it seems nouveau is gaining better support for hybrid now
Apr 17 10:10:36 <chilversc>	though I don't thing this is graphics card related this time, as the system worked fine, I just ended up having to log out and log back in to unbreak the overlay
Apr 17 10:11:45 <chilversc>	https://paste.centos.org/view/e172dee8
Apr 17 10:12:01 <chilversc>	though not sure if any of those missing objects are related to the logging out
Apr 17 10:12:36 <chilversc>	maybe the ones around the 28 minute mark, but the error at 26 minutes is what I suspect broke the overlay?
Apr 17 10:15:04 <ledeni>	chilversc, could be
Apr 17 11:20:18 <slavic>	Where would one find the repository for the downstream modified packages for Fedora, say gnome-software?
Apr 17 11:25:11 <[Enrico]>	slavic: https://src.fedoraproject.org/
Apr 17 11:29:22 <slavic>	Thanks Enrico.
Apr 17 11:46:28 <[Enrico]>	slavic: you're welcome
Apr 17 12:59:11 <slavic>	https://pastebin.com/raw/ex3Ci8KT   -- gnome-software compiles on F32 but not on F31. Any insight into the error?
Apr 17 13:00:29 <slavic>	libXau is installed (both 32 and 64 versions)
Apr 17 13:26:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic, rpm -q libgcrypt
Apr 17 13:27:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic,  no idea of why you are installing from source on a packaged distro
Apr 17 13:27:39 <slavic>	I'm trying to fix a bug with gnome-software
Apr 17 13:28:29 <slavic>	rpm -q libgcrypt returns libgcrypt-1.8.5-1.fc31.x86_64 and the 32bit equiv
Apr 17 13:29:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	slavic,  has there been a bugzilla reported
Apr 17 13:29:27 <slavic>	This has been reported everywhere :)
Apr 17 13:30:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	ok then this should be in #fedora-qa and or #fedora-devel
Apr 17 13:30:03 <slavic>	I'm fixing upstream though. I can't get it to compile on a locla machine that exhibits the bug: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/793
Apr 17 13:30:26 <slavic>	ok, I'll move
Apr 17 13:30:28 <slavic>	thanks
Apr 17 13:43:00 <johnfg>	so, just to verify, with fedora, /boot can *not* be on lvm?  No workaround possible?
Apr 17 13:44:16 <Khaytsus>	The bootloader can not read lvm, so no.
Apr 17 13:48:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	lvm isnt started until after the boot loader so there is no way for it to boot if boot was in a lvm
Apr 17 13:49:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	lvm isnt started until after the boot loader so there is no way for it to boot if /boot was in a lvm
Apr 17 13:53:29 <EffSquared>	Hi guys. Does anybody here know where I can find the source of a package if it is not listed on src.fedoraproject.org?
Apr 17 13:53:46 <EffSquared>	I am talking about firefox-wayland in particulat.
Apr 17 13:54:56 <Khaytsus>	EffSquared: Is it not just output from the FF srpm?
Apr 17 13:55:24 <Khaytsus>	Yes it is.
Apr 17 13:57:11 <johnfg>	K thanks.  I'll try and get some non-lvm space for /boot.
Apr 17 13:57:39 <johnfg>	On latest fedora, is there a minimal size for /boot recommended?
Apr 17 13:58:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	EffSquared, dnf info firefox-wayland tells you the source rpm  if nothing else you can get it from koji.fedoraproject.org
Apr 17 13:59:42 <Khaytsus>	johnfg: 500M is the default.  I have 210M used here with a normal setup.
Apr 17 14:00:20 <Khaytsus>	So just make it 500M.  If you make it smaller you'll be fighting with it at some point.
Apr 17 14:04:30 <EffSquared>	@Southern_Gentlem @Khaytsus Thank you for the info, I will have a look at the source package then. I am just looking for some wayland patches to bring over to NixOS.
Apr 17 14:04:56 <EffSquared>	With everybody working from home know, I need pipewire support! ;-)
Apr 17 14:05:13 <Khaytsus>	Everyone needs a hobby
Apr 17 14:05:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	*** Kernel 5.5.17 has been pushed to Testing for F30 and F31: Please test and give Karma on https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=kernel  ***
Apr 17 14:05:41 <johnfg>	I think I have this (which is now not usable for Fedora) at 1 gb.
Apr 17 14:06:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	johnfg, if in the future you are planning to use dnf system-upgrade i advise /boot at 1G
Apr 17 14:06:40 <EffSquared>	Not sure where to report this but all the "Link to raw patch" links on app.fedoraproject.org are broken if there is not direct source package, e.g.  https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/firefox-wayland/sources/patches/
Apr 17 14:06:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	EffSquared, known issue
Apr 17 14:07:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	app is known to be behind the curve
Apr 17 14:07:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	thus use koji which is the fedora builder
Apr 17 14:07:36 <johnfg>	Southern_Gentlem: I will.  especially if I decide I want, like in the case of trying those new kernels, a number of kernels around.
Apr 17 14:08:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	johnfg,  fedora default is 3
Apr 17 14:10:14 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: dnf system-upgrade doesn't use any space in /boot
Apr 17 14:10:22 <Khaytsus>	Maybe one additional kernel?  I dunno
Apr 17 14:11:32 <prussian>	^ can confirm, given my /boot is like 512MiB, I wouldn't be able to install otherwise lol
Apr 17 14:12:21 <Khaytsus>	My /boot has been 477M (why that size, no idea) for years
Apr 17 14:13:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	same here
Apr 17 14:14:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	grrr libvirt update gotta reboot
Apr 17 14:14:59 <Khaytsus>	I had it at just under 250M before this current install (circa f17 as I recall) and I had to randomly fight with it for space in /boot
Apr 17 14:15:02 <\n3p\>	arc-theme is obsolete for fedora 32 or there will be updated?
Apr 17 14:17:45 <Khaytsus>	\n3p\: I see arc-theme built for 32?  Whatever it is.
Apr 17 14:18:00 <Khaytsus>	Ah, it failed, nevermind
Apr 17 14:21:44 <ziff>	what's the right place to report a suspected bug in the SELinux targeted policy in Fedora?
Apr 17 14:23:36 <Khaytsus>	bugzilla
Apr 17 14:23:42 *	Khaytsus points to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla
Apr 17 14:23:49 <Khaytsus>	If it's a Fedora package, of course.  Third party package, no.
Apr 17 14:24:09 <ziff>	yep, vanilla Fedora 31
Apr 17 14:24:09 <ziff>	thanks!
Apr 17 14:25:02 <Khaytsus>	ziff: Make sure your system is labeleled correctly first, wouldn't be a bad idea to relabel the whole system and test.  Unless you're absolutely sure selinux has never been off, never moved files around with non-selinux suoporting tools, etc
Apr 17 14:46:42 <EffSquared>	\quit Thanks for the help
Apr 17 14:56:19 <ziff>	Khaytsus: thanks for the suggestion, doing an autorelabel seems to have resolved it (I don't quite understand why though - the labels of the involved process and file don't seem to have changed).
Apr 17 15:00:24 <mulletman>	Hey, i know this isnt a gaming channel (is there a linux gaming channel?) but for gaming on linux, for things like 0ad and maybe doom 2016 or the older halflifes would something with like an AMD A4-7300B and 8G mem be enough?
Apr 17 15:00:47 <mulletman>	Im not looking for a super system, just "good enough"
Apr 17 15:01:40 <billings>	what kind of GPU?  or does that have an integrated GPU?
Apr 17 15:01:57 <rudrab>	in f32, workspace is not visible. 4-finger swipe is working, but there is no indecator on the right of the screen
Apr 17 15:02:06 <mulletman>	integrated i think, was looking at refuirbished options on newegg
Apr 17 15:02:10 <plundra>	A4-7300B sounds very underpowered? https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+A4+PRO-7300B+APU&id=2439
Apr 17 15:02:49 <mulletman>	if i popped a GPU in there would that compensate for the older cpu?
Apr 17 15:03:08 <plundra>	The cpu it self seems super slow.
Apr 17 15:03:54 <mulletman>	thats a pity, does anyone know of any (used is fine) sub $400 systems that can play older games?
Apr 17 15:04:23 <mulletman>	(doom 2016 being the newest i have on my list)
Apr 17 15:05:15 <plundra>	I got a new system last weekend, and have been playing DOOM 2016 for the first time. Replacing my old Skull Canyon NUC, which has this cpu: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=intel+core+i7-6770hq+%40+2.60ghz&id=2759
Apr 17 15:05:38 <plundra>	And I wouldn't even think of trying DOOM 2016 on it. But maybe I'm wrong, don't know how low it scales. Maybe it's great.
Apr 17 15:07:10 <mulletman>	doh, that is way out of my price range.
Apr 17 15:07:23 <plundra>	Yeah no, not suggesting it, just for comparsion
Apr 17 15:07:24 <mulletman>	maybe i will jsut replay half life again a few times lol
Apr 17 15:07:41 <plundra>	https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=AMD+A8+PRO-7600B+APU&id=2352 That is even cheaper than the HP I assume you were looking at, in the refurb section?
Apr 17 15:07:49 <plundra>	The Lenovo one, at newegg.
Apr 17 15:08:01 <mulletman>	so you think that your system wouldnt run doom 2016?
Apr 17 15:08:07 <mulletman>	i was indeed
Apr 17 15:09:09 <plundra>	Not really, but I haven't tried :) And it's in iffy shape, cut screen in the beginning of HL2 it crashes.
Apr 17 15:09:16 <plundra>	It's running Debian, so probably why :P
Apr 17 15:11:21 <mulletman>	:)
Apr 17 15:13:03 <plundra>	mulletman: Going by the Minimum spec for DOOM 2016 in Steam, they have these cpus https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-FX-8320-Eight-Core-vs-Intel-i5-2400/1782vs793
Apr 17 15:13:47 <plundra>	To get a feel for it. I'm sure there's a million more factors, but I'd try and compare cpu mark score to get a feel for what might be doable.
Apr 17 15:14:25 <plundra>	That's a 2010 and 2012 cpu, but higher end ones at that time maybe.
Apr 17 15:17:58 <mulletman>	thanks for looking that up, i need to use cpubenchmarks more :)
Apr 17 15:21:06 <mulletman>	I know this isnt a lin/fed question but on spubenchmarks i see they have the option to buy now but the link doesnt seem to point to a page that one can buy said system, is there a way? (that would be the most super custom option i have ever seen but had to ask)
Apr 17 15:21:35 <mulletman>	agh. nix that previous question
Apr 17 15:21:57 <mulletman>	i had it in my head those were prices for systems not cpus. duh.
Apr 17 15:24:46 <plundra>	mulletman: If you are comfortable building a system by yourself? :-) https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/wQscCJ/budget-homeoffice-build
Apr 17 15:25:21 <mulletman>	am lazy :P but can put a sys together
Apr 17 15:25:30 <mulletman>	thanks for the link
Apr 17 15:25:33 <plundra>	(Just found as an example of within budget and as a starting point)
Apr 17 15:25:57 <mulletman>	am cheaper than lazy though so might end up going this route, thanks :)
Apr 17 15:26:32 <plundra>	No worries. I haven't built a system for like 15 years, before this last week when I finally did it again. Have been using Intel NUCs and playing games accordingly.
Apr 17 15:27:30 <mulletman>	lol, i usually avoid it but ended up having to put my server together last year as i coudnt find anything prebuilt that wasnt an absolute fortune
Apr 17 15:27:39 <plundra>	So very happy with it, everything just worked out of the box with no issues. Went with the Fedora 32 beta, because felt fine for new home/game pc. Graphics and all, just works great. Having steam as a third party repo built in just enabling was nice, just like in Debian.
Apr 17 15:28:20 <plundra>	Well yeah, I've liked the NUCs and been fine with the premium of them, price/performance. Because I just want something that works. Not having to figure out parts and pick the right thing.
Apr 17 15:28:32 <mulletman>	I hear ya!
Apr 17 15:28:39 <plundra>	But being budget constrained, I'd definitly go with building myself.
Apr 17 15:29:09 <mulletman>	btw, have you used steam? does that require CDs?
Apr 17 15:29:10 <plundra>	Specially after building this one successfully :D
Apr 17 15:29:19 <plundra>	Yes a lot, and no never.
Apr 17 15:29:35 <plundra>	You can at most enter a CD-key of old games you own (Like, a hardcopy of Half-Life) to add to it :)
Apr 17 15:30:15 <plundra>	Not sure if you ever could use a CD/DVD with Steam actually, for copying data I mean. I think it's been over the internet always.
Apr 17 15:30:39 <mulletman>	sweet! still got that, was going to try playonlinux but wasnt looking forward to it (wine, even a sanitized version, and I never have gotten along it seems)
Apr 17 15:31:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	mulletman, use the wine in fedora
Apr 17 15:32:16 <mulletman>	i do, mainly for foobar2000 but i have used it for a few other things but things usually end up working suboptimally (ie buggy)
Apr 17 15:32:52 <plundra>	I'm really impressed by Steam and the proton-magic, making DOOM 2016 available. Totally seamless, ps aux shows a .exe but nothing would make me think it wasn't native from the experience.
Apr 17 15:33:35 <plundra>	No like, "install on windows, copy the files, rotate computer towards the moon, pray some winetricks fixes helps, and then MAYBE it works"
Apr 17 15:34:08 <mulletman>	yeah, thats what i have heard - hence my renewed interest (plus the whole not going out thing lol)
Apr 17 15:35:45 <plundra>	Bing stuck at home definitly helped push me to pull the trigger :)
Apr 17 15:35:56 <johnfg>	What do you think is the *safest* way to shrink lvol1, in the current os (on vg0) or with gparted,           or can fedora installer handle this?
Apr 17 15:36:48 <johnfg>	that may not have  been a clear question: use my current os to adjust lvm, use gparted, or fedora installer?
Apr 17 15:37:52 <plundra>	I'd prep as much as possible before launching the installer. Just in general.
Apr 17 15:39:00 <plundra>	But are you using the filesystem currently? Then booting up the install media seems the right way to do it.
Apr 17 15:39:48 <plundra>	I always use xfs when having the option, so shrinking filesystem isn't an option, so no need to worry about it.
Apr 17 15:40:35 <RagingBuffalo>	Hi here, is there a pro with thunderbolt who could help me understand how to force recognise the docking again, on Fedora 31? as in a command to rescan or something
Apr 17 15:40:43 <RagingBuffalo>	as I do "boltctl list" I get nothing
Apr 17 15:41:18 <RagingBuffalo>	I also systemctl restart bolt.service
Apr 17 15:41:50 <RagingBuffalo>	I get this now with status: https://paste.centos.org/view/434ff28d
Apr 17 15:43:40 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: Hey I did $ xmodmap -e "keycode 89 = NoSymbol"  and it did the trick, the F5 key no longer works, thanks a lot, I love this keyboard I didn't want to discard it for a key
Apr 17 15:49:12 <RagingBuffalo>	seems that unplugging the mini DP cable on the docking side (and not on the computer side)
Apr 17 15:49:20 <RagingBuffalo>	made it automatically recnogised again
Apr 17 15:49:56 <RagingBuffalo>	that did not make the screen read again the signal, they are still blank
Apr 17 15:51:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	RagingBuffalo, reboot with dock attached?
Apr 17 15:51:29 <RagingBuffalo>	yes that usually work, after a few reboots. Sometimes immediately
Apr 17 15:51:39 <RagingBuffalo>	sometimes I have to disconnect the power of the docking
Apr 17 15:51:51 <RagingBuffalo>	I was trying a less disrupting workaround
Apr 17 15:52:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	so shutdown power cycle the dock and then restart the computer
Apr 17 15:52:14 <RagingBuffalo>	I usually waste 20min-1h everyday with that j*nk
Apr 17 15:52:59 <RagingBuffalo>	im int he middle of a training, thats why I don't want to reboot right now, I have several labs running
Apr 17 15:53:09 <RagingBuffalo>	I lost the screens
Apr 17 15:53:12 <RagingBuffalo>	beside laptop screen
Apr 17 15:53:56 <RagingBuffalo>	a bit ugly errors: https://paste.centos.org/view/2df966b2
Apr 17 15:57:53 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: Still seems a bit crazy that you have issues with f5..  what keyboard?
Apr 17 15:58:39 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: is an HP wireless one, is really comfortable
Apr 17 15:59:13 <RagingBuffalo>	it crashed, once I reconnected the docking, it froze the laptoip
Apr 17 15:59:30 <Khaytsus>	ew, low profile chicklets.  but odd f5 is in the way.  Anywho, glad it sorted it out fo ryou
Apr 17 15:59:44 <RagingBuffalo>	it just had the time to generate a report
Apr 17 15:59:46 <RagingBuffalo>	list_del corruption, ffff8e4aa25cf6a8->next is LIST_POISON1 (dead000000000100) [thunderbolt]
Apr 17 16:00:11 <RagingBuffalo>	so funny... POISON1 (dead)
Apr 17 16:00:15 <RagingBuffalo>	looks scary
Apr 17 16:01:11 <RagingBuffalo>	In the end I had to reboot after all, lost all my lab servers great...
Apr 17 16:08:40 <Robby>	question, so, we have https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages where we can lookup package info, what I am missing, however, is the ability to see a list of dependencies
Apr 17 16:08:40 <RagingBuffalo>	is there a way to check detection of screens in Wayland, I googled a lot I can't find much
Apr 17 16:08:45 <stofflswelt>	Hi! How can I view, what iss et as default browser?
Apr 17 16:09:12 <Robby>	the question is: is there some other fedoraproject webapp that shows this info?
Apr 17 16:11:39 <stofflswelt>	The funny thing is when I try xdg-open http://fedoraproject.org - Mozilla Thunderbird is openen.... *puzzled*
Apr 17 16:13:28 <RagingBuffalo>	stofflswelt, right click on html file and "open with"?
Apr 17 16:13:33 <RagingBuffalo>	if you use Gnome
Apr 17 16:15:34 <Robby>	found a workaround to my issue I guess, its to use https://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/
Apr 17 16:16:28 <Robby>	that one shows a "requires" section
Apr 17 16:17:05 <RichardET>	My personal opinion is that Fedora Mate seems to be the most easy to use of the Fedora spins
Apr 17 16:17:19 <RichardET>	any other views out there?
Apr 17 16:19:28 <matt3o12>	Hey, according to disks I have a 980GB block storage device with a ext file system (it is part of a LVM partition, the LVM is 997GB and the hard drive is 1000GB). When I mount the partition and write df -h, it only shows 898G (assuming df uses GiB not GB), I am missing about ~15GiB, where did they go?
Apr 17 16:21:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	RichardET, please see the channelfaq in the topic
Apr 17 16:22:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	basicly comes down to dsdf
Apr 17 16:25:48 <matt3o12>	 I ran resize2fs on that drive before that (without any specific size), maybe it didn't increase the file system all the way?
Apr 17 16:31:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	1000000000/1024
Apr 17 16:46:16 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: yeah, must be a hardware issue, but with this fix I have keyboard for some more time
Apr 17 16:49:46 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/02/hp-wireless-elite-keyboard-v2-primary-with-mouse-100789040-large.3x2.jpg
Apr 17 16:50:09 <sincere_fox>	chiclet indeed
Apr 17 17:03:10 <Khaytsus>	So curious.. how do you keep hitting F5? :P
Apr 17 17:03:31 <sincere_fox>	Not me
Apr 17 17:04:06 <sincere_fox>	it starts registering F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5F5
Apr 17 17:04:22 <sincere_fox>	so the websites start loading and loading and loading lol
Apr 17 17:06:29 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: OH.  The keyboard is broken?  Stuck key?
Apr 17 17:10:53 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: exactly, very frustrating
Apr 17 17:11:30 <Khaytsus>	So it's still going to cause you some issues with rollover etc, but if it works......  maybe you should fix it though ;)  Probably some crumb or something in it.
Apr 17 17:14:30 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: I've tried to clean it but doesn't seem to be the problem,
Apr 17 17:14:51 <Khaytsus>	Try whacking it with a hammer?
Apr 17 17:15:20 <peque>	Hi there! :-) I created a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. I can load this configuration with Firefox and everything works as expected. When I try to configure Chromium to do the same, the browser opens the GNOME network settings. I can configure the Network Proxy from there: select "Automatic" and pass `file:///my/path/to/pac.js` as the configuration URL, just like I would do with Firefox. I turn off the wired connection, then
Apr 17 17:15:21 <peque>	turn it on again and... nothing happens. The proxy does not seem to work and I can not use Chromium to get to the domains behind the proxy. Any idea on what could be wrong? Using Fedora 31 Workstation. Thanks in advance! ^^
Apr 17 17:16:05 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: well, that's something I havent try for sure
Apr 17 17:17:36 <vwbusguy>	I'm having some trouble upgrading to f32 since some modules are stuck looking for f31 release (gimp, libgit2).  I could just uninstall reinstall these, but is there an obvious way to upgrade them?
Apr 17 17:17:56 <Khaytsus>	Yuck, still weirdness updating with modules? :(
Apr 17 17:18:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	vwbusguy,  uninstall the modules
Apr 17 17:18:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	then try again
Apr 17 17:18:26 <whatnow111>	hey southern.
Apr 17 17:19:19 *	Southern_Gentlem grabs a dryer sheet to clear away the static cling 
Apr 17 17:20:54 <whatnow111>	southern, i found one thing i overlooked when try to make the computer less noisier.
Apr 17 17:21:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	what was that
Apr 17 17:21:27 <whatnow111>	a good case.
Apr 17 17:22:41 <whatnow111>	with thicker panel. the one i was using was a cooler master haf and i think due to thinner side panel, the noise was audible.
Apr 17 17:24:59 <whatnow111>	i had an ancient antec case. when i transferred the same motherboard over, i hear much less fan noise.
Apr 17 17:26:06 <vwbusguy>	Southern_Gentlem, disabling the modules worked
Apr 17 17:26:23 <vwbusguy>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks
Apr 17 17:26:43 <mangoicedtea>	how do I install soulseek? http://www.soulseekqt.net/news/node/1
Apr 17 17:27:10 <mangoicedtea>	please help, thanks
Apr 17 17:31:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, what have you done
Apr 17 17:31:40 <mangoicedtea>	Southern_Gentlem, just downloaded the .tgz file
Apr 17 17:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	and its a compressed file
Apr 17 17:32:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	so uncompress it
Apr 17 17:32:47 <mangoicedtea>	ok done there is an appimage
Apr 17 17:33:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	have you read their documentation on how to install
Apr 17 17:34:38 <mangoicedtea>	nope
Apr 17 17:34:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am not going to install that on my system to tell you how to install it
Apr 17 17:34:39 <peque>	I have used the GNOME Settings to try to configure a proxy loading a local Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. The configuration is taking no effect. Any idea on what could be wrong? (the configuration file is fine, since it works when loaded with Firefox)
Apr 17 17:36:09 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, If it's an appimage, normally you can run it directly
Apr 17 17:36:36 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, like it's an executable.  Make sure you really trust where you downloaded it from!
Apr 17 17:37:36 <mangoicedtea>	vwbusguy, https://paste.centos.org/view/dba55f33
Apr 17 17:38:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, dnf search xcb
Apr 17 17:38:29 <vwbusguy>	mangoicedtea, It's not packaged by Fedora so your support here will be pretty limited for that
Apr 17 17:40:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, we highly discourage stuff like this but it is your machine so your issue
Apr 17 17:41:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	mangoicedtea, there is a client for soulseek in the repos
Apr 17 17:42:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	dnf search soulseek
Apr 17 17:49:57 <mangoicedtea>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks
Apr 17 18:02:48 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: 32 only?  I don't see anything here.
Apr 17 18:03:13 <Khaytsus>	Oooh, gotcha.  not that name, I see it now
Apr 17 18:04:16 <Khaytsus>	So what is soulseek anyway, besides piracay
Apr 17 18:04:18 <Khaytsus>	piracy
Apr 17 18:06:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	p2p network
Apr 17 18:07:36 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, piracy
Apr 17 18:12:53 <peque>	Khaytsus, I usually use p2p networks to download Fedora images :-P
Apr 17 18:14:14 <Khaytsus>	...

Apr 17 18:16:19 <yates_home>	i'm trying to get sdk installed
Apr 17 18:16:29 <yates_home>	per https://gradle.org/install/
Apr 17 18:16:43 <yates_home>	is aws-sdk-java THAT sdk?
Apr 17 19:16:28 <overflyer>	So ChanServ directed me here from #redhat
Apr 17 19:16:33 <overflyer>	Hello everyone, is the project of bpfilter different from what Facebook is planning to replace iptables/nftables with using eBPF technology? I heard there is supposed to be a Facebook talk out there from the BPDF summit on November 12, 2019 but I cant find it.
Apr 17 19:29:03 <dowdle>	overflyer: Find the homepage of bpfilter?
Apr 17 19:29:59 <overflyer>	no not the home page just some third-party articles about it
Apr 17 19:30:02 <dawud>	overflyer: https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2019/talks/bpf-at-facebook/ but slideshare is down for me at the moment
Apr 17 19:30:27 <overflyer>	I can see the slideshare and use it
Apr 17 19:30:29 <overflyer>	awesome
Apr 17 19:30:33 <overflyer>	thank you!
Apr 17 19:30:46 <dowdle>	https://linux-audit.com/bpfilter-next-generation-linux-firewall/
Apr 17 19:30:58 <overflyer>	ah yes I got this article open
Apr 17 19:31:36 <overflyer>	So lets see if facebook is doing something different or if it is just using bpfilter....

Apr 17 20:40:47 <aterius>	I updated to Fedora 32, and I'm not having issues with DNS resolution in docker, (I can't use podamn currently I've filed a few pending bugs) of the form ```Err1: 1 https://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security

Apr 17 20:40:58 <aterius>	Anyoen else having issues?
Apr 17 20:49:48 <Khaytsus>	aterius: No, but perhaps you need some proxy stuff if you use a proxy
Apr 17 20:50:06 <Khaytsus>	I had to set proxy vars in docker envs at work because we have a proxy we have to manually set
Apr 17 20:50:11 <aterius>	 * Anyone else having issues?
Apr 17 20:51:17 <aterius>	Yeah, I'm not using a proxy. Just a standard networking environment

Apr 17 21:29:35 <vwbusguy>	Fedora 32 upgrade went fine.  I did have to remove some py2 libs and disable a couple of modules.  I didn't lose anything important with the py2 libs.
Apr 17 21:29:49 <vwbusguy>	dnf check showed empty after the upgrade
Apr 17 21:39:52 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: about 7 weeks too early IMO ;)
Apr 17 21:40:16 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: but that's.... interesting.  modules, eh..  I dunno why those don't upgrade, that seems buggy.. but python modules?
Apr 17 21:40:23 <vwbusguy>	Khaytsus, that is your opinion and you're welcome to it.  I upgrade a week or two before GA so I can hel pout my coworkers.
Apr 17 21:40:27 <vwbusguy>	*help put
Apr 17 21:40:30 <vwbusguy>	*help out...
Apr 17 21:40:46 <Khaytsus>	vwbusguy: I do too.. in a vm ;)
Apr 17 21:40:48 <vwbusguy>	Khaytsus, Not python modules.  gimp was one of them.  libgit2 was another.  and jmx.
Apr 17 21:41:05 <Khaytsus>	erm, py libs...sorry
Apr 17 21:41:18 <vwbusguy>	I had to remove some python libs via dnf first
Apr 17 21:41:24 <Khaytsus>	Odd...
Apr 17 21:41:36 <vwbusguy>	I don't remember which ones but they didn't take anything important with them
Apr 17 21:41:55 <Khaytsus>	I guess I'll see when I update in a few months
Apr 17 21:42:07 <vwbusguy>	I think they were probably orphaned gnome deps from older versions
Apr 17 21:42:25 <vwbusguy>	(I know, you don't like gnome...)
Apr 17 21:47:25 <Khaytsus>	I'm not allowed to talk about gnome anymore
Apr 17 21:50:53 <peque>	For anybody interested, I ended up creating an issue in GNOME Settings (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/957) it seems the problem is with trying lo use a local file (i.e.: `file:///...`)
Apr 17 21:54:29 <akuhcap>	Hey im trying out wayland instead of xorg on this install and im wondering how i should go about with drivers.  I have a nvidia 1660
Apr 17 21:58:52 <piston>	Can anyone suggest If conflicting services are on here? I am not able to connect wifi.
Apr 17 21:58:57 <piston>	https://pastebin.com/PVYmu9H7
Apr 17 22:01:14 <piston>	I shouldnt have installed with deepin as primary environment,
Apr 17 22:01:54 <piston>	thats where the conflict started I feel, now not able to connect on any environment.
Apr 17 23:05:25 <mrvenkman>	Question about partitioning: I have just removed some space from my windows partition using gparted. Freed up ~10G how do I now allocate that to my home? https://pasteboard.co/J4hJWS7.png
Apr 17 23:07:40 <tolland>	hey, im getting loads of peculiar scrambled windows problems since the last update
Apr 17 23:08:51 <tolland>	firefox and chrome keep crashing with glitched windows
Apr 17 23:11:11 <mrvenkman>	Nailed it.
Apr 18 00:07:13 <mrvenkman>	I think I might of just fucked up my /home partition.
Apr 18 00:07:13 <Khaytsus>	mrvenkman: This is a family channel, such language is not acceptable.  Please remember children and their grandmothers may be watching.
Apr 18 00:07:47 <Jordan_U>	mrvenkman: What exactly did you do to your /home/ partition?
Apr 18 00:08:41 <mrvenkman>	Well, I tried to add to it from my Windows partition. I freed up some space (only 10Gb) using gparted. Then I couldn't move the new space so I thought ,,,
Apr 18 00:08:57 <mrvenkman>	Maybe it's because I am using the swap space etc.
Apr 18 00:09:04 <mrvenkman>	so I used a LIVE usb stick
Apr 18 00:09:19 <mrvenkman>	and tried with that. It's complicated.
Apr 18 00:09:28 <mrvenkman>	I am here so it's not all bad.
Apr 18 00:11:12 <mrvenkman>	Actually it's not as bad as I thought.
Apr 18 00:13:56 <mrvenkman>	What is the difference between a root partition and a home partition?
Apr 18 00:14:40 <mrvenkman>	tmpfs                                     3040896  1899040   1141856  63% /tmp

Apr 18 00:15:48 <mrvenkman>	Shouldn't the most space be allocated to "home2?
Apr 18 00:16:27 <kk4ewt>	lsblk|fpaste please
Apr 18 00:16:36 <kk4ewt>	and df -h |fpaste

Apr 18 00:19:25 <mrvenkman>	Not even a screenshot! It's selectable!
Apr 18 00:19:33 <mrvenkman>	I am really enjoying Fedora
Apr 18 00:20:12 <mrvenkman>	I selected the defaults when I installed it ... just don't know why I don't have much space.
Apr 18 00:20:53 <mrvenkman>	So I took 10G off winblows and it's now free to use. I would like that to use.
Apr 18 00:24:41 <BobLfoot>	mrvenkman: root is systemspace while home is userspace
Apr 18 00:25:25 <mrvenkman>	BobLfoot, ok thanks. Can I basically not re-allocate space to home?
Apr 18 00:25:53 <mrvenkman>	kk4ewt, sorry for the pasting of text .. that fpaste utility is amazing!
Apr 18 00:26:28 <Khaytsus>	Looks like the 10g is just a partition, not allocated to anything, not part of the lvm
Apr 18 00:27:27 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, I took it off my windows partition using gparted. Then I reformatted it to be lvm in the hope I could add that 10g to my home
Apr 18 00:27:41 <Khaytsus>	it's just a partition, not part of your lvm
Apr 18 00:28:10 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, ok. But it id formatted as lvm?
Apr 18 00:28:19 <Khaytsus>	doesn't really matter
Apr 18 00:28:24 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, ok
Apr 18 00:28:27 <mrvenkman>	:(
Apr 18 00:28:55 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, how would I go about moving it to home?
Apr 18 00:29:46 <Khaytsus>	First off, you said your /home is broken..  is it?
Apr 18 00:29:57 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, no ... I thought it was
Apr 18 00:30:08 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, I am using it right now.
Apr 18 00:30:38 <BobLfoot>	mrvenkman: As I understand it you can allegedly add the new partition to the lvm and then to home, but I've never had success doing that.  Crashed many a system trying.  YOu could also format the partition and mount it to your existing system and have a /home2 or /stuff section for files.  That's probably clear as mud but best I can desscribe it.
Apr 18 00:30:42 <Khaytsus>	then you just pvcreate on the new partion then vgextend existinglvm /new/partition
Apr 18 00:30:50 <mrvenkman>	I thought I lost any remaining space from /home but it seems I haven't.
Apr 18 00:30:55 <Khaytsus>	https://www.krenger.ch/blog/linux-lvm-how-to-adding-a-new-partition/    read through that
Apr 18 00:31:08 <Khaytsus>	basically this person is adding /dev/sdb1 (a new partition) to his existing lvm, named 'pandora'
Apr 18 00:31:48 <Khaytsus>	but that just adds the space, you'd have to extend etc
Apr 18 00:31:53 <BobLfoot>	disclaimer it has been a few fedora releases since I messed with lvm/pvm I'm sure things have improved.  Khaytsus's instructions would be more current than mine
Apr 18 00:31:54 <mrvenkman>	BobLfoot, and Khaytsus thank you :) :) I'll read through the help. BobLfoot Thank you :)
Apr 18 00:32:06 <Khaytsus>	Honestly the _easiest_ thing.....  is just format that new partition as ext4 and use it as storage
Apr 18 00:32:20 <BobLfoot>	Khaytsus: ++
Apr 18 00:32:43 <Khaytsus>	Messing about with the lvm is a neat exercise but...  well..  a lv spread over two drives is twice as much failure opportunity
Apr 18 00:33:16 <Khaytsus>	If you can find 10g of chunk of stuff you can move to it, or whatever, that'll work out just as well
Apr 18 00:33:28 <Khaytsus>	and you don't have to do nearly as much..  just format it and mount it
Apr 18 00:34:10 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, interesting.
Apr 18 00:34:40 <Khaytsus>	You can do that booted from the system itself.. make sure it's working, pretty trivial..  add it to fstab
Apr 18 00:34:51 <mrvenkman>	Yeh
Apr 18 00:35:14 <Khaytsus>	you can then chown the mount point as your user and write to the whole drive, or mkdir something and chown it..
Apr 18 00:35:24 <mrvenkman>	Yeh
Apr 18 00:35:47 <mrvenkman>	I answered a question on the fedora website about that...
Apr 18 00:36:26 <mrvenkman>	https://ask.fedoraproject.org/t/vagrant-up-not-mounting-the-directory/6040/2
Apr 18 00:37:08 <mrvenkman>	But forget that, my issue is that I just need the space
Apr 18 00:37:36 <mrvenkman>	I'm gonna read that link you gave me and report back.
Apr 18 00:37:48 *	dowdle gives mrvenkman a few spacebars, some commas, and finally a period.
Apr 18 00:37:50 <mrvenkman>	Thank you, Khaytsus and BobLfoot
Apr 18 00:44:37 <mrvenkman>	Right .. am gonna reboot using the live usb. wish me luck! if I'm not back in an hour - call tech support!
Apr 18 01:24:13 <ossifrage>	This is annoying, wireshark in f31 can't read from a pipe without being a member of the wirshark group
Apr 18 01:25:11 <ossifrage>	"ssh ... tcpdump -i eth0 -s 1800 -w - udp port 53 | wireshark -k -i -" used to work, now it fails with a permission denied error dialog (for /usr/bin/dumppcap
Apr 18 01:26:04 <ossifrage>	 /usr/bin/dumppcap is now 0750

Apr 18 18:21:19 <retentiveboy>	`iptables -L INPUT` shows first entry ACCEPT's related traffic as expected but second entry ACCEPT's all from anywhere to anywhere.
Apr 18 18:21:36 <retentiveboy>	Am I reading this correctly?
Apr 18 18:22:22 <retentiveboy>	3rd rule jumps to INPUT_direct and 4th to INPUT_ZONES.  That 2nd one though seems to short-circuit and accept anything.
Apr 18 19:43:29 <dowdle>	So, when there is a package for something AND a module... and the module is older... how to I get dnf to install the newer package?
Apr 18 19:43:46 <dowdle>	I'm guessing that I've got something set saying the module is preferred... but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot that.
Apr 18 19:44:17 <dowdle>	The package in question is gimp-2.10.18 package vs the gimp-2.10.14 module (in Fedora 32)

Apr 18 20:02:05 <sincere_fox>	maybe gets pressed faster than xmodmap has the chance to register?
Apr 18 20:02:10 <zuvy>	Im attempting to install from a source and it says I need TypeScript 3.8, dnf cant find it. Help please!
Apr 18 20:02:17 <[R]>	xmodmap isn't a deamon
Apr 18 20:02:21 <[R]>	it remaps the keyboard in X
Apr 18 20:02:39 <[R]>	zuvy: you'll have to talk to the author if they dont provide a good dependency list
Apr 18 20:02:54 <dowdle>	zuvy: What version of Fedora?
Apr 18 20:03:08 <zuvy>	dowdle: 32
Apr 18 20:03:10 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: Broken keyboard bruh
Apr 18 20:03:35 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: But how is the name of everything on earth and elsewhere is this broken keyboard bypassing xmodmap
Apr 18 20:04:26 <Khaytsus>	sincere_fox: pay shipping and I'll mai you a proper keyboard
Apr 18 20:04:27 <Khaytsus>	IBM M

Apr 18 20:31:23 <NoOova>	Guys i have a problem with wireguard via network namager.
Apr 18 20:31:56 <NoOova>	nmcli connection up "Linode WireGuard"
Apr 18 20:32:00 <NoOova>	Error: Connection activation failed: The VPN service 'org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.wireguard' was not installed.
Apr 18 20:32:31 <NoOova>	I have a "wireguard-tools-1.0.20200319-1.fc30.x86_64" installed
Apr 18 20:33:55 <sincere_fox>	Khaytsus: I am even getting the roll over problems you waid
Apr 18 20:34:00 <sincere_fox>	said* lo
Apr 18 20:34:04 <sincere_fox>	lol*
Apr 18 20:34:52 <Khaytsus>	NoOova: You have wireguard itself?
Apr 18 20:35:35 <Khaytsus>	the module, that is
Apr 18 20:35:43 <Khaytsus>	Just wireguard-utils isn't going to do it
Apr 18 20:35:51 <NoOova>	I have a 'wg' command in my desktop fedora. Also i setted up a connection in network preferences (in network manager interface)
Apr 18 20:36:01 <Khaytsus>	rpm -qa | grep wireguard
Apr 18 20:36:11 <Khaytsus>	if you don't have a kmod-wireguard you missed a step ;)
Apr 18 20:36:24 <NoOova>	i have no kernel module
Apr 18 20:36:41 <NoOova>	ok. thx
Apr 18 20:39:59 <zaccanasta>	hi guys, i'm playing with dwm and wanna run few programs upon login. none of .Xclients, .xprofile, .xinitrc seem to work
Apr 18 20:41:05 <[R]>	how are you starting dwm
Apr 18 20:42:01 <zaccanasta>	now i'm playing with it in rawhide on a VM. It's started by gdm
Apr 18 20:42:27 <[R]>	none of those files have antyhing to do with autostart
Apr 18 20:42:36 <[R]>	your wm needs to support autostart if you want things to autostart
Apr 18 20:43:49 <zaccanasta>	[R]: ok so those files are only sourced when starting X via startx
Apr 18 20:45:04 <kk4ewt>	zaccanasta; yes but you are starting gdm which is wayland by default
Apr 18 20:45:20 <kk4ewt>	grab something other than gnome and text
Apr 18 20:45:55 <zaccanasta>	kk4ewt: what if i start gdm on X11?
Apr 18 20:47:41 <kk4ewt>	are you?
Apr 18 20:51:38 <zaccanasta>	i changed it now, let's see
Apr 18 20:55:18 <M_aD>	dowdle: when is the go/nogo meeting for fedora 32?
Apr 18 20:56:30 <dowdle>	M_aD: It was last Thursday.
Apr 18 20:56:36 <dowdle>	M_aD: And it was a no-go.
Apr 18 20:56:51 <dowdle>	M_aD: I'll have to check the schedule to see when the next one is.

Apr 18 20:57:20 <dowdle>	I can't get there because my DNS is being very weird.
Apr 18 20:57:51 <tnelis>	(Next thursday yes.)
Apr 18 20:58:03 <M_aD>	tnelis: thanks
Apr 18 21:22:57 <zaccanasta>	oh well, kwm is messing up with my wifi driver
Apr 18 21:23:24 <Khaytsus>	How so

Apr 18 22:09:15 <schmuck>	not large but very long man boobs.
Apr 18 22:09:39 <schmuck>	AndyCap and andy|, read the above.
Apr 18 22:09:55 <zaccanasta>	cool, there's an "autostart" patch that works well
Apr 18 22:10:25 <schmuck>	zaccanasta: yep. SO what do you think about the informatoin that I provided above?
Apr 18 22:11:35 <zaccanasta>	schmuck: what did I miss?
Apr 18 22:11:58 <nauticalnexus>	zaccanasta: ignore them
Apr 18 22:12:26 <zaccanasta>	nauticalnexus: I guess

Apr 19 00:13:55 <Taim>	dnf history is an option.
Apr 19 00:14:39 <golanv1>	I would use dnf history also. If it isn't listed there, it's probably a dependency you shouldn't remove.

Apr 19 10:45:04 <cr0ssw1nd>	I have a fresh installation of Fedora on my old laptop
Apr 19 10:45:32 <cr0ssw1nd>	so far so good, but something is wrong with DNS resolving when I connect WiFi
Apr 19 10:46:14 <cr0ssw1nd>	 /etc/resolv.conf get only 1 dns server
Apr 19 10:46:34 <cr0ssw1nd>	though I set 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 via nm-connection-editor

Apr 19 13:01:09 <FranciscoD>	jezebel: they're used for organisation, but generally not used by end-users
Apr 19 13:01:18 <FranciscoD>	use `dnf grouplist --hidden` to list them
Apr 19 13:01:21 <FranciscoD>	etc.
Apr 19 13:12:53 <miku>	FranciscoD, tnelis, I would like to solict your opinions if you'd be so kind as to spare the time
Apr 19 13:13:11 <miku>	the program: https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte
Apr 19 13:13:51 <miku>	seeing as the version listed in that changelog hasn't been bumped for 11 years, I'm tempted to assume it's B.S by this point in time
Apr 19 13:14:46 <miku>	name: gambatte-sdl, version: 0.4.1, release: 1.20200308git56e3371
Apr 19 13:15:20 <miku>	I feel I shouldn't use 0.1.20200308git... as it isn't explicitly stated to be a prerelease
Apr 19 13:15:33 <FranciscoD>	best to ask upstream
Apr 19 13:15:56 <FranciscoD>	these can be considered as post-release snapshots, or pre-release
Apr 19 13:16:02 <FranciscoD>	depends on what upstream's plans are
Apr 19 13:16:33 <FranciscoD>	either case will work for the package: the idea is that the version-release bits always increase, so that the "upgrade path" is maintained
Apr 19 13:16:46 <miku>	upstream = author of program?
Apr 19 13:17:03 <FranciscoD>	yes, the developers are "upstream"
Apr 19 13:17:18 <FranciscoD>	we package maintainers and linux distributions are "downstream" of them
Apr 19 13:17:33 <FranciscoD>	(like a river: developers are the source, and we're all downstream from the source)
Apr 19 13:17:43 <FranciscoD>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Staying_close_to_upstream_projects
Apr 19 13:17:55 <miku>	gotcha
Apr 19 13:19:17 <miku>	suppose I make 3 changes to 0.4.1, so fooapp-0.4.1-1.blabla, 0.4.1-2.blala, 0.4.1-3.blabla
Apr 19 13:19:38 <FranciscoD>	yes, then when a new release comes out, you get 0.4.1-...
Apr 19 13:19:40 <FranciscoD>	er
Apr 19 13:19:43 <FranciscoD>	0.4.2-...
Apr 19 13:19:47 <miku>	then comes 0.4.2, do I go 0.4.2-1.blabla or continue 0.4.2-4.blabla?
Apr 19 13:19:48 <FranciscoD>	so the upgrade will be OK
Apr 19 13:19:57 <soda2[m]1>	i have one question - why updating by gnome-software is so slow? when i use dnf all is ok
Apr 19 13:19:58 <FranciscoD>	no, the release can be reset for each version
Apr 19 13:20:08 <miku>	great!
Apr 19 13:20:12 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: define "slow"?
Apr 19 13:20:13 <miku>	I am happy when I learn new things
Apr 19 13:20:32 <FranciscoD>	miku: reading the guidelines is a good start, lots of information there
Apr 19 13:20:42 <soda2[m]1>	5-10 minutes of searching packages to update for example
Apr 19 13:21:02 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: it downloads the metadata, then checks for updates
Apr 19 13:21:08 <FranciscoD>	dnf runs a timer that updates the cache periodically
Apr 19 13:21:24 <soda2[m]1>	yup, but why so slow? when i use dnf or yum everything is fast
Apr 19 13:21:58 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: if you use `sudo dnf --refresh` it'll also take time: it'll download the metadata again
Apr 19 13:22:16 <soda2[m]1>	because of this gnome-software seems broken
Apr 19 13:22:21 <miku>	FranciscoD, guideline documents tend to be too dense for community outsides to grasp on their first few tries...
Apr 19 13:22:22 <soda2[m]1>	in my opinion
Apr 19 13:23:06 <FranciscoD>	miku: there are lots of other documents: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package for example
Apr 19 13:23:18 <FranciscoD>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers is step by step
Apr 19 13:23:44 <miku>	a lot like manpages in that they are helpful when you already know a program and seek to improve your utilization of it
Apr 19 13:23:54 <miku>	but very frustrating and not much use when you are new to program
Apr 19 13:24:08 <FranciscoD>	miku: depends on the man page: most contain examples, which are great for beginners
Apr 19 13:24:26 <FranciscoD>	also depends on the person :)
Apr 19 13:24:47 <FranciscoD>	soda2[m]1: file bugs, provide information, the developers will see what can be done to improve the user experience
Apr 19 13:25:12 <miku>	I definitely do have somewhat of those TL;DR genes
Apr 19 13:27:46 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Maybe try using pkcon which is a CLI for PackageKit, which is the component behind GNOME Software (if you observe noticably better perf you could exclude PK and focus on the GNOME Software, otherwise it could be a problem in either of these)
Apr 19 13:29:03 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Note that apparently (per Wikipedia) PK might use hawkey/librepo directly (i.e. not via DNF), meaning it's very possible there are differences between both as you observe.
Apr 19 13:30:44 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: One example you could check: Support for Zchunk added in F30 <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Zchunk_Metadata>. This improved perf immensely for me with DNF, but I'm not sure if it's supported by PK/GNOME Software -- so if not it could explain what you're observing.
Apr 19 13:32:31 <soda2[m]1>	i was traying run gnome-software by terminal command to check logs but i noticed memory error ;/ probably i cant run this program in terminal
Apr 19 13:33:32 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Actually that might help figure it out. What kind of error? An OOM condition?
Apr 19 13:34:16 <soda2[m]1>	Memory protection violation
Apr 19 13:34:26 <soda2[m]1>	i think this is not related
Apr 19 13:35:02 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Well if you have some time it'd be great if you could report it still. Regardless of whether you're launching from the CLI or the shell it shouldn't happen.
Apr 19 13:35:12 <soda2[m]1>	probably conflict with running dnf/yum/gnome-software
Apr 19 13:35:46 <soda2[m]1>	an you try run gnome-software by terminal?
Apr 19 13:36:06 <soda2[m]1>	i think you cannot do that, just like me
Apr 19 13:36:47 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: I'll reinstall it and check, but again this shouldn't result in memory violation (that's usually wording for segmentation faults).
Apr 19 13:37:53 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Assuming it's a subprocess, and nondeterministic, and the app retries repeatedly, then with a little imagination it could also explain your issue (I know, lots of assumptions, but just sayin' ;P)
Apr 19 13:38:32 <soda2[m]1>	hmm, i wondering how i can check what is up with that wihout command output xd
Apr 19 13:39:31 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Well again try pkcon, that would give you a chance to split to search in two and exclude one half.
Apr 19 13:45:22 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Also use pkmon (while using GNOME Software and pkcon) to monitor PackageKit events/transactions.
Apr 19 13:45:46 <soda2[m]1>	updates check in pkcon is fast too so this is not related
Apr 19 13:46:02 <soda2[m]1>	ok i will check it
Apr 19 13:46:43 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Interesting, so it's pkmon + GNOME Software might yield something interesting. For the record I tried launching GNOME Software from the CLI, no problem on my machine, definitely no memory violation.
Apr 19 13:48:20 <soda2[m]1>	yup! pkmon can show me output so we have step one :D
Apr 19 13:54:25 <soda2[m]1>	now when i run software-gnome updating is short and i cant reproduce issue. ;/
Apr 19 13:54:36 <soda2[m]1>	but i know how check it in future :) thx
Apr 19 13:55:37 <tnelis>	soda2[m]1: Given launching it from the CLI is supposed to work, it'be extra cool if you could file that memory violation if you still have the log! Otherwise yes, would have to wait until it reappears.
Apr 19 13:56:30 <soda2[m]1>	ahhh probably i know what is the problem with terminal running
Apr 19 13:56:49 <soda2[m]1>	when i use suda i recive memory valation
Apr 19 13:56:53 <soda2[m]1>	sudo*
Apr 19 13:57:13 <soda2[m]1>	but when i enter just gnome-software all is right
Apr 19 13:58:08 <tnelis>	Ah, alrighty!
Apr 19 13:58:44 <soda2[m]1>	thanks a lot :)
Apr 19 15:51:35 <jim87>	Hello! I'm having an issue with an intel I211 ethernet port. On windows I'm able to connect to the router with a 1000Mbps connection, but on linux I'm only able to reach 100mbps
Apr 19 15:51:44 <jim87>	How can I sort this out?
Apr 19 15:56:14 <jim87>	Somehow autoneg was off and set to 100 Mbps... I've now set autoneg still to off, but 1000 Mbps

Apr 19 16:34:19 <bitlord>	Hi, have some complex question regarding networking seutp. I have an old box which I use as a hypervisor it has two interfaces in two networks (wifi goes outside), and lan which is used locally. I'm using libvirt and used default firewalld rules. Now I want access to that box and to VMs inside virtual network, to do that I changed default firewalld zone for `virtbr0` to `dmz`, that did solve one issue, but now VMs cannot go to the internet using
Apr 19 16:34:19 <bitlord>	that wifi interface. Is there any easy guide on how to achieve something similar?
Apr 19 16:45:46 <securerootd>	hello
Apr 19 17:18:07 <jidar>	I just switched over to systemd-resolved, did a few things like enable DNSOverTLS, disable DNSSEC, and now I'm trying to understand why something like ping takes forever (roughly 10s) to being pinging my local address. All things point to working, valid, and speedy DNS responses timing dig against 127.0.0.53, and resolvectl query take far less than 1 second; running strace -w, shows me poll is
Apr 19 17:18:09 <jidar>	waiting 99.9% of the time, and I note that eventually it calls out to: connect(5, {sa_family=AF_UNIX, sun_path="/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket"}, 110) = 0; but this is > 10 seconds
Apr 19 17:18:59 <jidar>	the same can not be said for ping -6, against the same address
Apr 19 17:24:33 <bitlord>	does `ping -n` do the same?
Apr 19 17:26:22 <jidar>	> time ping b-wing.local -c 1 -n 1
Apr 19 17:26:28 <jidar>	> real    0m20.014s
Apr 19 17:26:40 <jidar>	> time resolvectl query b-wing.local
Apr 19 17:26:46 <jidar>	> real    0m0.012s
Apr 19 17:28:07 <bitlord>	oh, I thought you were pinging local IP directly not DNS and I was thinking some reverse lookup maybe took that much :(
Apr 19 17:28:34 <jidar>	oh!
Apr 19 17:28:54 <jidar>	yeah, I was reading the man page on that going, hurm, not sure what this will do lol
Apr 19 17:29:44 <jidar>	time ping -c 1 -6 b-wing.local -> real    0m0.846s
Apr 19 17:29:46 <jidar>	just as a FYI
Apr 19 17:44:34 <jidar>	ok, it was LLMNR
Apr 19 17:44:44 <jidar>	MulticastDNS seems quick, but LLMNR is super super slow
Apr 19 18:07:10 <soda2[m]1>	i have one question. i am going to buy someking server (hp or lenovo probably). i want to create home lab for learning openstack,openshift,ansible is there something I should pay special attention to? from your experience?
Apr 19 18:07:48 <soda2[m]1>	buy somekind*
Apr 19 18:21:36 <ledeni>	soda2[m], check topic of the channel --> /topic
Apr 19 18:32:43 <kk4ewt>	soda2[m]; lots of cpu power (lots of processors min 16) and at least 1-2G of ram per processor (min 32G) and it most be able to do virtualization
Apr 19 18:33:10 <kk4ewt>	and with that lots of storage space for VMs
Apr 19 18:33:25 <\n3p\>	jidar, what dns server do you use?
Apr 19 18:35:59 <kk4ewt>	soda2[m] take a look at "https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/ "

Apr 19 19:17:35 <Bayesian_Coffee>	getting an error when trying to use GUI GNOME Software Update: `Unable to download updates: could not do untrusted question as no klass support`
Apr 19 19:17:35 <Bayesian_Coffee>	a quick Google search reveals that this has something to do with the repo mirrors being out of sync? what's up with that? why would that not work while `# dnf update` would?
Apr 19 19:22:42 <Mac101>	anyone got any suggestions for a really cheap/small portable device to run fedora on?
Apr 19 19:50:48 <Taim>	Raspberry PI
Apr 19 19:51:21 <Taim>	Just not a PI 4 quite yet.
Apr 19 20:08:07 <golanv1>	No Pi4 yet?
Apr 19 20:08:43 <Foxfir3>	Silverblue. How to go about Wine?
Apr 19 20:09:14 <Foxfir3>	Should wine be run from a toolbox?
Apr 19 20:14:38 <Taim>	Golanv: PI 4, It...works-ish....on Fedora 32...sort of.  It still needs some time to mature there, imo.
Apr 19 20:21:08 <golanv1>	Oh I see.
Apr 19 20:21:24 <golanv1>	I don't have one (yet).
Apr 19 20:33:07 <Foxfir3>	so all the guys who were on IRC at work, are now watching Netflix?
Apr 19 20:33:54 <Foxfir3>	third Silverblue install. in doubt now. Almost no documentation. IRC channel almost dead silent.
Apr 19 20:34:33 <Foxfir3>	its things like how to install Wine that makes it frustrating. Am I supposed to dump all those packages into the ostree?
Apr 19 20:35:16 <bitlord>	probably just not many people here use Silverblue :(
Apr 19 20:37:03 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: okay. Maybe I invested too early in Silverblue. Its a great idea, but so many things are shaky. Like broken Flatpaks. Seems like there are no money behind the project, and no one writing documentation. I would offer my help, but the Fedora community seems closed.
Apr 19 20:37:56 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, have you tried on mailing lists?
Apr 19 20:38:22 <Foxfir3>	And there is the Gnome bleatware. I dont get the meaning of that. Silverblue is definately not for beginners, so why Gnome? Why not some desktop that is easy to remove.
Apr 19 20:38:28 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: I didnt know there was a mailing list. Maybe I should I should try that
Apr 19 20:39:18 <Foxfir3>	bitlord: Who is paying for Fedora?
Apr 19 20:39:40 <caterfxo>	red hat sponsors it
Apr 19 20:39:47 <caterfxo>	o-rt
Apr 19 20:39:57 <Foxfir3>	okay. So thats the trouble. There is money behind CoreOS, but not Silverblue.
Apr 19 20:41:12 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/contribute I hope those are valid still
Apr 19 20:41:56 <bitlord>	Foxfir3, so it seems there is a forum like platform, instead of mailing list
Apr 19 20:43:24 <tnelis>	Yeah I receive digests from the community forum, most of the discussion is about Silverblue.

Apr 20 10:24:40 <[Enrico]>	gintonyc: depends what you want to do
Apr 20 10:24:51 <[Enrico]>	for normal desktop I would say it's a very bad idea
Apr 20 10:27:52 <gintonyc>	Yes, its on a desktop.
Apr 20 11:52:29 <plarsen>	gintonyc, unplug it from the network?
Apr 20 12:04:26 <gouf>	how to make fedora use xorg instead of wayalnd ?
Apr 20 12:06:18 <bitlord>	gouf, if you ask about fedora workstation, on the login you can select gnome on xorg session

Apr 20 14:01:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	gintonyc, why do you want to disable all outgoing traffic
Apr 20 14:02:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	gintonyc, plarsen was basicly saying if yo disable all outgoing traffic you dont need a network connection

Apr 20 14:37:03 <corshmock>	It's for Nicotine+
Apr 20 14:41:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	all outgoing connections should open incoming
Apr 20 14:43:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: mmmmm.  I'm getting IP: 78.16.51.68 Port: 15000/tcp CLOSED
Apr 20 14:44:25 <Khaytsus>	You sure your ISP isn't doing it?
Apr 20 14:44:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  so open the port in your firewall
Apr 20 14:45:10 <Khaytsus>	Some ISPs block p2p ports etc
Apr 20 14:51:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, what Desktop environment are you using
Apr 20 14:55:05 <corshmock>	Khaytsus: not sure pal
Apr 20 14:55:36 <corshmock>	Is it a firewalkd command?  Sorry I'm quite new to Linux?
Apr 20 14:56:02 <corshmock>	I'm on Fedora 31
Apr 20 15:00:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Apr 20 15:02:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, give us the output url of that command
Apr 20 15:07:15 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/25915cf8
Apr 20 15:08:00 <corshmock>	That's a neat command
Apr 20 15:10:10 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  so you are using gnome
Apr 20 15:10:49 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: apologies, I wasn't sure
Apr 20 15:11:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, fedora has many desktop environments thats why i asked you your answer should of been gnome or workstation
Apr 20 15:11:46 <linuxkeitaro>	thank @FranciscoD
Apr 20 15:12:23 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: I get you.  So does the command vary from one environment to another?
Apr 20 15:12:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 20 15:12:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	well i am going to instruct in using the gui
Apr 20 15:15:25 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: is the gui standard part of the os?
Apr 20 15:15:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Apr 20 15:15:52 <corshmock>	Lovely
Apr 20 15:16:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	soon as i can find it in gnome
Apr 20 15:16:14 <gintonyc>	Southern Gentlem: It was just to control the outgoing connection
Apr 20 15:16:37 <corshmock>	Can I search for it in apps?
Apr 20 15:18:31 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: What are yo ulooking for, the firewalld gui?
Apr 20 15:18:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	yep
Apr 20 15:18:54 <Khaytsus>	Isn't it just firewall-config
Apr 20 15:19:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	not comeing up in the live
Apr 20 15:19:35 <Khaytsus>	Dunno.  I don't keep a WS VM on hand, makes me queasy it just being on disk.
Apr 20 15:19:46 <corshmock>	I've found Firewall Configuration - not installed yet
Apr 20 15:20:13 <corshmock>	Should I install it?
Apr 20 15:20:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats strange
Apr 20 15:20:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  hold on a few
Apr 20 15:20:33 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: sure
Apr 20 15:20:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, what did you use to install your fedora
Apr 20 15:21:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am installing in a vm to see whats up
Apr 20 15:21:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: Oh dear, I can't remember, but I think I know what you mean.  gui should be in standard build?
Apr 20 15:21:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	from getfedora or the updated isos in the topic
Apr 20 15:22:20 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: Sorry, I don't understand
Apr 20 15:23:41 <Khaytsus>	I doubt that matters Southern_Gentlem
Apr 20 15:23:53 <Khaytsus>	But odd that firewall-config isn't in the base ks
Apr 20 15:25:12 <corshmock>	The firewall configuration tool in software gets very good reviews!
Apr 20 15:25:24 <corshmock>	Should I install it?
Apr 20 15:25:52 <Khaytsus>	dnf install firewall-config
Apr 20 15:26:28 <ohmyfish>	hi .. sry short question .. it's gnome related .. is there a way to reduce the size of the symbols (overview - on the left - gnome panel (i do not want to use an extension .. like dash2panel ect ..)?  per css or something else..
Apr 20 15:26:40 <Khaytsus>	It's installed here though...  so..  I'm a bit confused why it wouldn't be in WS
Apr 20 15:26:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	no
Apr 20 15:26:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	ohmyfish, no
Apr 20 15:27:09 <ohmyfish>	uh .. ok thx southern
Apr 20 15:27:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	its gnome you have to use the tweaktool and an extension
Apr 20 15:27:36 <corshmock>	That's installed now
Apr 20 15:28:08 <corshmock>	and running now
Apr 20 15:28:14 <ohmyfish>	yep, but i can't change the size per tweaks & i do not want to install dash2panel .. to many extensions
Apr 20 15:28:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, ok f2 type firewall
Apr 20 15:28:43 <corshmock>	f2 type firewall
Apr 20 15:28:53 <corshmock>	?
Apr 20 15:28:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	press f2
Apr 20 15:29:11 <dowdle>	alt+f2?
Apr 20 15:29:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	f2
Apr 20 15:29:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	or the windows key
Apr 20 15:29:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	or click applications at the top left
Apr 20 15:30:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	dowdle, **tag your it*
Apr 20 15:30:18 *	Southern_Gentlem runs away
Apr 20 15:30:19 <corshmock>	I've got firewall configuration running.  Sorry nothing happening on f2 or windows key
Apr 20 15:31:53 <corshmock>	Should I add port 15000 (the one that's closed)?
Apr 20 15:32:09 <Khaytsus>	I thought you just clicked the applications text at the top, because ya know, that's obvious user design
Apr 20 15:32:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock,  you need 2234
Apr 20 15:32:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	tcp open that under public
Apr 20 15:32:44 <corshmock>	Yep
Apr 20 15:33:51 <corshmock>	I've added 2234 into ports, but it isn't showing up.  No errors
Apr 20 15:37:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	2234 select tcp enter
Apr 20 15:37:41 <corshmock>	So I've added that into public
Apr 20 15:37:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	and restart the firewall
Apr 20 15:37:50 <corshmock>	and it's showing up as entered
Apr 20 15:37:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	now test with nicotine
Apr 20 15:40:40 <corshmock>	I add the port, then reload firewalld, and the port disappears.  Still not connecting in nicotine+
Apr 20 15:41:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	in the firewall select permanet
Apr 20 15:41:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	public
Apr 20 15:41:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	port 2234 tcp
Apr 20 15:42:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	corshmock, why have you not updated this computer in over a month
Apr 20 15:42:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	you are still on the 5.4 kernel
Apr 20 15:45:29 <corshmock>	Southern_Gentlem: afraid that it might break :(  Do you update regularly?
Apr 20 15:46:06 <corshmock>	So I've restarted with systemctl restart firewall d, but still no joy
Apr 20 15:46:53 <Khaytsus>	Southern_Gentlem: That is funny, firewall-config is not on the WS spin, but is on XFCE.  That seems quite odd.  Maybe gnome has some other specific firewall tool I'm unaware of?
Apr 20 15:49:18 <corshmock>	It's not saving the port I add.  If I restart firewalld, or the firewall config app, port 2234 disappears
Apr 20 15:49:35 <corshmock>	I wonder could I add 2234 through cli?
Apr 20 15:50:17 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps you didn't tell it persistent or whatever it is in firewalld
Apr 20 15:51:13 <corshmock>	Ah
Apr 20 15:51:24 <corshmock>	Does anyone know the exact command?
Apr 20 15:51:33 <jidar>	--permanent
Apr 20 15:52:02 <jidar>	which doesn't make it immediate, you need to restart it after that iirc
Apr 20 15:53:37 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it was my understanding that the "gui tools" for administration was part of Cockpit now ... now specific to a DE?
Apr 20 15:53:54 <plarsen>	s/now specific/not specific/
Apr 20 15:55:14 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: huh..  interesting.  Let me look
Apr 20 15:56:55 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: I wonder how one discovers cockpit.  It's not a default link in Firefox, it's not in the menus, etc
Apr 20 15:57:31 <Khaytsus>	And cockpit isn't enabled by default anyway
Apr 20 15:57:34 <plarsen>	It's definitely a separate install; like so many other things, it's stuff you need to understand
Apr 20 15:57:37 <plarsen>	to ue
Apr 20 15:57:38 <plarsen>	use*
Apr 20 15:57:43 <plarsen>	grrr - fingers are on strike!
Apr 20 15:57:44 <corshmock>	sudo firewall-cmd --zone=dmz --add-port=2234/tcp --permanent - success
Apr 20 15:58:08 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: So no I can't imagine they'd use that as the default administration since it isn't even installed.  Being able to adjust a firewall seems like a pretty common thing to me for users.
Apr 20 15:58:09 <corshmock>	But systemctl restart firewalld fail - timeout
Apr 20 15:58:18 <Khaytsus>	Perhaps less than it used to be, with firewall and dynamic ports etc, but
Apr 20 15:58:20 <plarsen>	That said, Cockpit has definitely been enhanced a lot over the last few years - tons of articles and more to explain how to use it.
Apr 20 15:58:47 <Khaytsus>	plarsen: I am not really referring to cockpits function/disfunction, rather its end-user discoverability.  How would a user even know to use it.
Apr 20 15:59:07 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it's a question if you need to reinvent the wheel for every DE and even a TUI interface, or have a single web interface that works regardless of how you have things installed/setup
Apr 20 15:59:47 <plarsen>	I'm sure something could be done to help users to find it. Red Hat definitely uses Cockpit to show how 'user friendly'  RHEL is to a Windows user.
Apr 20 15:59:59 <plarsen>	That said - I rarely use it .... :D
Apr 20 16:00:12 <Khaytsus>	If it's replacing the GUI tools, then it should be installed by default and have links in the menus.  That simple.
Apr 20 16:01:24 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, most of the GUI tools we used to have are gone. With the exception of NetworkManager, you don't have GUI tools for partitioning, boot management, DE configuration etc.  the few that we have, are ancient left-overs?
Apr 20 16:01:55 <Khaytsus>	Given most of those arne't needed anymore...
Apr 20 16:02:03 <Khaytsus>	gparted works fine for partitions, the rest.. useless
Apr 20 16:02:23 <plarsen>	I haven't used GUI tools to configure a server for ages ...
Apr 20 16:02:40 <plarsen>	So I can only tell you I don't see the tools listed anymore when I look for packages
Apr 20 16:03:17 <plarsen>	Fedora used to have an admin menu with all kinds of "control panel" gui apps for everything from users, networking, disks etc.
Apr 20 16:03:28 <plarsen>	Do anyone use the "disk administrator" gui??
Apr 20 16:03:35 <plarsen>	It's AWFUL ....
Apr 20 16:03:54 <plarsen>	Hasn't changed in a long long time
Apr 20 16:06:11 <Piston>	hi folks, I getting following error while connecting via nm , any pointers would help..
Apr 20 16:06:23 <plarsen>	Khaytsus, it's announcements/requests like this I remember: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/CockpitManagementConsole

Apr 21 01:49:06 <gambl0re>	what's the most straight forward to install postgresql?
Apr 21 01:49:45 <Sokel>	dnf...
Apr 21 01:50:12 <plarsen>	gambl0re, dnf install postgresql
Apr 21 01:50:39 <plarsen>	ehhh + -server.. So, dnf install postgresql-server
Apr 21 01:50:46 <gambl0re>	is that all it takes? why am i reading docs online that i have to do all these other steps
Apr 21 01:51:15 <Sokel>	you install it, init the database, start it up.
Apr 21 01:51:16 <Sokel>	done
Apr 21 01:51:17 <plarsen>	Depends on what exactly you want, the type of features, libraries you need available to different programming languages etc.
Apr 21 01:52:02 <gambl0re>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PostgreSQL
Apr 21 01:52:17 <mutk>	gambl0re, https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/database/postgresql/about.html     is best.
Apr 21 01:52:26 <mutk>	Its a good recipe
Apr 21 01:53:00 <gambl0re>	mutk: thanks
Apr 21 01:53:47 <gambl0re>	if i run this command...$ sudo dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
Apr 21 01:54:00 <gambl0re>	what's the difference if i just did $ dnf install postgresql?
Apr 21 01:54:45 <Sokel>	you need sudo unless you're running the command as root, obviously.
Apr 21 01:55:16 <gambl0re>	i'm not talking about sudo.
Apr 21 01:55:26 <gambl0re>	postgresql-server postgresql-contrib
Apr 21 01:55:59 <mutk>	postgresql-server   is the SERVER package.  postgresql-contrib  is a package that has a lot of useful contributed tools for postgres.
Apr 21 01:57:07 <gambl0re>	does dnf install postgresql include both server and contrib?
Apr 21 01:57:15 <mutk>	gambl0re, I don't know
Apr 21 01:57:16 <Sokel>	no, it doesn't.
Apr 21 01:57:31 <mutk>	gambl0re,   dnf info postgresql-contrib         have a look
Apr 21 01:57:33 <Sokel>	dnf info explains that postgresql is not the server package.
Apr 21 01:57:34 <gambl0re>	then why wouldnt the docs just say to do 'dnf install postgresql'?
Apr 21 01:58:22 <Sokel>	the postgresql package is for the client portion.
Apr 21 01:58:29 <plarsen>	gambl0re, because that's not the database. That's tools/software to connect and use database
Apr 21 01:58:33 <Sokel>	Summary      : PostgreSQL client programs
Apr 21 01:59:17 <Sokel>	dnf info postgresql-server: Summary      : The programs needed to create and run a PostgreSQL server
Apr 21 02:02:16 <gambl0re>	is postgresql-server the actual postgres database?
Apr 21 02:02:38 <gambl0re>	im confused with which packages to install. there's postgres postgres-contrib postgres-server postgres-client
Apr 21 02:02:49 <gambl0re>	i just want to install postgres db on my computer
Apr 21 02:02:53 <mutk>	gambl0re, dnf info  tells you
Apr 21 02:03:22 <mutk>	You have already had this explained :0
Apr 21 02:03:31 <gambl0re>	ok nevermind. thanks anyways
Apr 21 02:03:36 <plarsen>	gambl0re, you can see what each package contains like this: https://paste.centos.org/view/65bddbb6
Apr 21 02:04:19 <gambl0re>	yea i get. what makes me confused is when i do a google search on how to install postgres i'll get like 4 different answers
Apr 21 02:04:51 <plarsen>	Welcome to Linux - where having one way to do things is NEVER good enough :D
Apr 21 02:05:45 <plarsen>	gambl0re, you need to consider the distribution, when things were written up (things change) and what the actual goal is.  Some guides assume a specific type of installation/setup of the database and include more stuff than you may need to
Apr 21 02:05:56 <gambl0re>	plarsen: you use centos?
Apr 21 02:06:04 <plarsen>	Among others, yes
Apr 21 02:06:08 <gambl0re>	but why?
Apr 21 02:07:03 <Sokel>	...because it's an enterprise distro?
Apr 21 02:09:17 <plarsen>	gambl0re, one of the reasons I found Linux so helpful back in the days was that it's not just done one way. There are options for EVERYTHING.   Not just between distributions, but within them. It makes it possible for you to pick the right tool for the right project
Apr 21 02:10:21 <plarsen>	I use Fedora every day on my workstations. It's very current with things, I get to use great virtualization and containerization tools right out of the standard/official repos.  With CentOS I know what I design today will work 5 years from now. Unmodified (well, people probably wouldn't use it if I didn't keep it up to date though)
Apr 21 02:23:09 <sonik_hex>	plarsen, that pastebin is a great example of a dnf search.  very useful
Apr 21 02:24:57 <gambl0re>	how do i search packages in rpm fusion?
Apr 21 02:25:46 <gambl0re>	anyone know how i can install pgadmin, i dont see it in software management when i searched
Apr 21 02:26:14 <plarsen>	gambl0re, install the repo(s) and use the command I showed you. You can add --enablerepo and --disablerepo to control which repos it will query
Apr 21 02:27:12 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Did you _really_ look? ;) <https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/s/pgadmin>
Apr 21 02:27:51 <zuvy>	gambl0re: rtfm
Apr 21 02:28:10 <gambl0re>	tnelis: yea when i searched in software manager for pgadmin, it returned empty
Apr 21 02:28:58 <gambl0re>	https://i.imgur.com/5c8Aj8v.png
Apr 21 02:29:06 <gambl0re>	just in case you don't believe me
Apr 21 02:31:03 <Sokel>	https://paste.centos.org/view/a5a76c27
Apr 21 02:32:40 <zuvy>	You cannot trust output from KDE Discovery or from Gnoma Software, do a real dnf search
Apr 21 02:32:54 <gambl0re>	zuvy: why not?
Apr 21 02:32:59 <sonik_hex>	gambl0re, $ dnf search pgadmin
Apr 21 02:33:10 <Sokel>	pgadmin3 is the package.
Apr 21 02:33:21 <Sokel>	I would never rely on the software centers of a DE, ever.
Apr 21 02:33:23 <sonik_hex>	gambl0re, $ dnf info pgadmin3.x86_64
Apr 21 02:33:59 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Indeed. I think not all packages are considered "applications" as in "AppStream" apps. It's not a question of trust or anything IMO; it's just that they're like "app stores", not for low-level components/packages or server software.
Apr 21 02:34:23 <zuvy>	gambl0re: years decades of use
Apr 21 02:34:52 *	sonik_hex nods
Apr 21 02:36:17 <gambl0re>	zuvy: oh
Apr 21 02:36:50 <zuvy>	gambl0re: see tnelis comment above
Apr 21 02:37:57 <tnelis>	gambl0re: I just realized pgAdmin 4 is not packaged yet, yet that's perhaps the only one with a Qt implementation. If pgAdmin 3 is strictly a web application (which I think it is), then it would explain why it doesn't appear in "app stores" (it requires server components that don't fit the traditional app model).
Apr 21 02:39:20 <tnelis>	gambl0re: This would be a good fit for a flatpak, but I don't see any on Flathub, you might be out-of-luck if you want the latest version outside of third-party repos (Copr has a couple you might want to check out <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=pgadmin>).
Apr 21 02:39:28 <gambl0re>	is pgadmin 4 better than pgadmin3?
Apr 21 02:40:42 <tnelis>	gambl0re: I don't know, I'm kind of a psql guy myself ;). I would imagine there are improvements yes, though of course a version bump does not _always_ means strictly better.
Apr 21 02:41:39 <tnelis>	gambl0re: Actually, check this out <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1771823>; it seems it's no longer supported upstream so yeah, the situation is not ideal right now.

Apr 21 18:20:42 <grant>	installing gtk3 downgrades glib2 on fedora 32, is there a way around this?
Apr 21 18:23:09 <Khaytsus>	dowdle: Well, that was easy, I had to delete the pool I'd set up for my custom location and the "default" pool, then just recreate 'default' at my custom path.  Pretty trivial, no data loss or moving or such
Apr 21 18:24:04 <Khaytsus>	Be niceer if there were just a "default" flag, not literally "default" as the name of the pool
Apr 21 18:24:07 <Khaytsus>	but ah well

Apr 22 12:40:14 <DaFiN>	hi
Apr 22 13:19:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	@f32release
Apr 22 13:19:52 <fedbot>	Fedora 32 is planned for release on 2020-04-28, which is 6 days, 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 44 seconds from now
Apr 22 14:37:49 <SeeM2>	I already upgrade to 32 on desktops and vps and screwed only one thing: Python version changed, which broke virtualenv and backend for a simple webpage was not feeding new data. :) And certbot warned me about expiring certificates, since it did not renewed them automaticcaly. Upgrade process was very clean and simple. The only thing I didn't like is how dnf handles appstreams during system update. It's a
Apr 22 14:37:55 <SeeM2>	known issue and among wild proposals for Fedora 33
Apr 22 14:53:44 <ikonia>	in F31 I'm on a host with one physical network interface, I'm considering making two bridge devices hanging off the single physical interfaces
Apr 22 14:54:20 <ikonia>	normally I do this on servers with the bridge config files in the sysconfig/network-scripts section, but I'm wondering if there is anyway to do this with the network manager gui in F31 ?
Apr 22 14:54:54 <ikonia>	also is there any issues with the primary IP being on a bridge device rather than the physical interface, I cant' think of any, but I've never had reason to put it on a bridge device before
Apr 22 14:59:03 <rationaltech>	ikonia You can have the primary IP be on a bridge in most cases a bridge has the physical ports IP in it anyway since that's what you're doing...making a bridge and a one way bridge wouldn't be super useful unless all you wanted to do was monitor.  No idea on the network manager bit.
Apr 22 15:01:20 <ikonia>	rationaltech: not quite,
Apr 22 15:02:02 <ikonia>	rationaltech: my use case is I'm running and hold workstation while I'm at home as a kvm host, it only has one interface on it, so I want to put all VM's against the bridge so that they are exposed to the network with a network IP and just use the interface as a pass through
Apr 22 15:02:18 <ikonia>	for this to work the interface can't have it's own ip
Apr 22 15:02:20 <ikonia>	so I'd need a second bridge for the host to appear on the network
Apr 22 15:06:33 <akik>	ikonia: i've done it with the nmcli tool. would that help you? i've listed the commands i ran
Apr 22 15:16:00 <ikonia>	akik: tht would really help
Apr 22 15:16:05 <ikonia>	akik: did you have any problems with it ?
Apr 22 15:16:19 <ikonia>	(out of interest)
Apr 22 15:19:33 <akik>	ikonia: https://pastebin.com/raw/TLpSkW8F no problems, eth0 is on dhcp and eth1 on that static ip
Apr 22 15:19:50 <akik>	br0 and br1 that is
Apr 22 15:20:15 <akik>	somebody said they needed this option but i didn't need it
Apr 22 15:20:29 <akik>	nmcli connection modify eth0 connection.autoconnect yes
Apr 22 15:20:39 <ledeni>	ikonia: you can run 'nm-connection-editor' GUI not sure about setting up your network but you can look at
Apr 22 15:23:31 <akik>	ikonia: i use this setup to give a lxc container network access to both those network(s)
Apr 22 15:26:10 <fedorafan>	if you like q and would like to talk about it join ##qanon
Apr 22 15:26:36 <akik>	nice person
Apr 22 15:28:36 <ikonia>	akik: that sounds like a similar usecase for just a different reason, sounds like what I'm using for
Apr 22 15:29:31 <ikonia>	akik: looks really good, thank you
Apr 22 15:30:04 <ikonia>	ledeni: didn't know about nm-connection-editor either, thankyou
Apr 22 15:30:17 <akik>	i had to learn it because fedora 31 removed those network-scripts configs
Apr 22 15:30:26 <akik>	or was it fedora 30
Apr 22 15:37:33 <ledeni>	ikonia:you're welcome
Apr 22 16:03:38 <plundra>	Hmm, how do I run a polkit agent under sway? I only see a reference to polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1 which doesn't seem tobe available.
Apr 22 16:04:36 <plundra>	I assume it's built into gnome or somehing now. So maybe ome other agent or way is possible?
Apr 22 16:05:07 <plundra>	Ah, lxpolkit was even installed, let me try that.
Apr 22 16:06:46 <plundra>	lxpolkit worked great. Let me add that to the startup :-)

Apr 22 16:52:14 <gintonyc>	Hi, in Grub2 / Fedora 31, it's not enough to put a GRUB_BACKGROUND in /etc/default/grub (and update command) ? Thanks
Apr 22 17:02:03 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Is this a new setup with a new image file?
Apr 22 17:02:18 <gintonyc>	Yes
Apr 22 17:02:50 <gintonyc>	New to Fedora, i thought grub has a background :D

Apr 22 17:11:40 <gintonyc>	sorry, i will try with PNG, thanks
Apr 22 17:11:41 <dowdle>	gintonyc: And I put it in /boot/grub2/themes/system/
Apr 22 17:12:23 <gintonyc>	and the parameter "GRUB_BACKGROUND=/boot/grub2/themes/system/background.PNG" on /etc/default/grub, yes ?
Apr 22 17:12:28 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Also, I think you need to comment out this line #GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT="console"
Apr 22 17:12:54 <gintonyc>	oh ok, i thought when you use a theme, not just a background, so it's sure, i didn't comment this line.
Apr 22 17:13:21 <dowdle>	gintonyc: I believe that line needs to be commented out for the background image to show up.
Apr 22 17:13:46 <gintonyc>	Ok thanks
Apr 22 17:18:00 <dowdle>	gintonyc: And of course, every time you change /etc/default/grub you need to rerun grub2-mkconfig with the proper parameters (depending on boot mode)
Apr 22 17:18:39 <gintonyc>	depending on boot mode ?
Apr 22 17:20:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	bios or efi
Apr 22 17:20:54 <gintonyc>	i'm on EFI
Apr 22 17:21:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	so what is the parameters for efi
Apr 22 17:24:23 <mrproper>	I'm using Fedora Cinnamon 31 in VMware Fusion and when I'm in the terminal and do an alt-left (or right) to move forward or back whole words, it prints D or C respectively instead of moving the cursor.
Apr 22 17:25:13 <gintonyc>	I update with this command : grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg and i see that i have another file "/etc/grub2-efi-.cfg" ! I think i didn't update the right file after my "nano /etc/default/grub"
Apr 22 17:26:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	thus the depending on boot mode
Apr 22 17:26:15 <dowdle>	gintonyc: If you are UEFI boot, It'd be the /etc/grub2-efi-.cfg
Apr 22 17:26:42 <dowdle>	 (which is a symlink to /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
Apr 22 17:26:44 <dowdle>	)
Apr 22 17:27:19 <gintonyc>	Ok so another reason it didn't work :D
Apr 22 17:27:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	mrproper, so are you in bash or in vim
Apr 22 17:27:57 <mrproper>	Southern_Gentlem: Bash, zsh really.
Apr 22 17:28:06 <mrproper>	Hmmmm it works in bash so zsh is broke.
Apr 22 17:28:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	or it has different setting
Apr 22 17:29:00 <Southern_Gentlem>	expecting zsh to act like bash is a PEBCAK to me
Apr 22 17:29:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suggest looking at the zsh documentation
Apr 22 17:29:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	then if it says that should work then file a bugzilla
Apr 22 17:33:17 <mrproper>	Southern_Gentlem: Control works so it's a different setting.
Apr 22 17:33:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	so it was a pebcak
Apr 22 17:35:13 <mrproper>	It wa.s

Apr 22 17:47:08 <unun>	Hello, I am just getting started with docker, and was trying to find a lightweight redhat based distro to base my container off of.
Apr 22 17:47:15 <unun>	I found atomic, which turned into CoreOS, which has now turned into a different CoreOS?
Apr 22 17:47:50 <unun>	But I am not even sure if coreos is an OS for container hosting, or to tuned to be hosted
Apr 22 17:47:55 <unun>	could anyone help clarify?
Apr 22 17:49:33 <plundra>	unun: It's to host the containers.
Apr 22 17:51:06 <akik>	unun: i use centos 7 as my docker host(s)
Apr 22 17:51:55 <akik>	centos 8 also works with some modifications
Apr 22 17:55:59 <unun>	Ah, ok. Is there a lightweight redhat distro that is specialized to be used as a container operating system? I am currently using fedora which is 400mb size wise. which isnt bad, but I would think there would be better out there, no?
Apr 22 18:00:34 <unun>	alpine by contrast is only 5 mb
Apr 22 18:03:14 <chncynic[m]>	Besides silverblue all others will be exactly as you know it
Apr 22 18:07:54 <unun>	ok. thanks
Apr 22 18:29:22 <gintonyc>	So i tried again to configure the background of Grub but nothing... I have an error message but i not have the time to see it... I can find a log somewhere ? boot.log begin with plymouth right ?
Apr 22 18:29:57 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Given that there is no OS / logger when in grub, I wouldn't think there is a way to get a log entry.
Apr 22 18:32:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	dmesg maybe
Apr 22 18:32:25 <gintonyc>	so i put a PNG in /boot/grub2/themes/system (i see 2 others PNG "background" and "fireworks". I put the paramater grub_background on /etc/default/grub. Launched the grub2-mkconfig for EFI. Its talk about the background... But it didn't work.. Maybe i will stay with the black style :D
Apr 22 18:34:15 <gintonyc>	I found nothing about grub in dmesg
Apr 22 18:36:45 <dowdle>	gintonyc: You might look into what limitations there are with images you can use.  I've not done it with UEFI.
Apr 22 18:36:51 <Sokel>	gintonyc: EFI?
Apr 22 18:36:57 <dowdle>	Sokel: Yep.
Apr 22 18:37:48 <gintonyc>	dowdle, i can try with background.png which is already in the system folder right ? If it's work, it's my image which has the problem.
Apr 22 18:43:16 <gintonyc>	Ok, i take a movie so i have the error message, same with the background.png ! "It's : error: ../../grub-core/fs/fshelp.c:257:file ` /EFI/fedora/locale/fr.gmo` not found"
Apr 22 18:44:00 <Sokel>	that is not related to backgrounds.
Apr 22 18:44:25 <gintonyc>	yeah but i didn't see this error before change the background :D
Apr 22 18:44:42 <Sokel>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1592124 doesn't matter.
Apr 22 18:46:12 <ledeni>	gintonyc: try this steps --> https://paste.centos.org/view/84d28230
Apr 22 18:46:23 <gintonyc>	I didn't have the locale folder xD
Apr 22 18:46:28 <Sokel>	https://paste.centos.org/view/5c96374b - this worked for me immediately.
Apr 22 18:48:25 <ledeni>	Sokel: :)
Apr 22 18:49:12 <dowdle>	Sokel: So you used gfxterm_background.mod for it and didn't use the line in /etc/default/grub?
Apr 22 18:51:41 <gintonyc>	Ok i followed the link, thanks. You know where i can find the locale folder ?
Apr 22 18:57:14 <dowdle>	gintonyc: Looks like it takes a bit more work with UEFI boot... but be that as it may... what locale folder?
Apr 22 18:58:15 <ledeni>	 gintonyc: copy "/boot/grub2/locale" to "/boot/efi/EFI/fedora/locale"
Apr 22 18:59:17 <gintonyc>	The problem is i don't have the folder locale in /boot/grub2
Apr 22 19:00:18 <gintonyc>	dowdle: the fr.gmo not found error

Apr 22 20:00:59 <omajid>	hey folks. is there a way to generate a list of members of a fas group automatically on the wiki? i would rather not have to maintain https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet#Members by hand :)
Apr 22 20:03:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	go into fas and cut and paste ?
Apr 22 20:03:29 <omajid>	well, manual operations like cut+paste is what i am trying to avoid
Apr 22 20:05:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	that group is small
Apr 22 20:05:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	omajid, #fedora-admin may can help
Apr 22 20:06:16 <omajid>	thanks
Apr 22 20:07:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	omajid, also you need to check with every group member that their info is on the webpage (some have private settings enabled in FAS)
Apr 22 20:10:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	is ok to have on the wiki rather
Apr 22 20:19:32 <dowdle>	How can I troubleshoot an sshd.service that is enabled but sometimes doesn't start on boot?
Apr 22 20:19:37 <dowdle>	I'm not seeing any log entries.
Apr 22 20:21:44 <dowdle>	The last log entry for it shows that it shutdown prior to me rebooting the system.
Apr 22 20:22:38 <omajid>	what does `systemctl status sshd.service` say?
Apr 22 20:23:51 <dowdle>	omajid: That is is enabled and not running.
Apr 22 20:24:40 <dowdle>	omajid: With the same last log entry.  No mention of a failure to start.  It just didn't.
Apr 22 20:25:00 <janos_>	dowdle: maybe check the boot log?
Apr 22 20:25:09 <janos_>	in /var/log/boot.log iirc
Apr 22 20:25:54 <dowdle>	Also, the stock sshd.service file has Restart=on-failure and RestartSec=42s
Apr 22 20:28:40 <dowdle>	janos_: Nothing relevant in the boot.log.  grep ssh /var/log/boot.log shows two lines, one for x2dkeygen.slice and the other for sshd-keygen.target
Apr 22 20:28:52 <janos_>	dang
Apr 22 20:29:07 <dowdle>	It's like it forgot to start and doesn't realize it isn't running... a double wammy.
Apr 22 20:41:32 <dowdle>	It's been doing this for a few months... maybe 1 out of 3 boots... started in F31... and still here in F32 pre-release.
Apr 22 20:41:38 <dowdle>	But that's the only system I've had the trouble with.

Apr 22 22:55:45 <Caterpillar>	do you know if there is an utility that shuts down the computer if it detects that the fan is running at 0 RPM? I need that because I have a liquid cooling system and the motherboard detects the pump RPM as if it is a regular fan
Apr 22 23:01:08 <tnelis>	Caterpillar: That's a good question. I don't know of any though somebody else might know more. Worst case you could hack something up quick quickly by polling with lm-sensors or something. All that being said, I don't know how easy it is to fry a modern CPU or GPU -- my understanding is that virtually every hardware package now has thermal safeties built-in (first with throttling then shutting down
Apr 22 23:01:14 <tnelis>	completely).
Apr 22 23:08:58 <Caterpillar>	tnelis: yes, but with a liquid cooling system, you may trigger liquid to go to boiling point, which can trigger cooling system to destroy

Apr 23 10:58:20 <stemid>	I have to keep the pavucontrol app running when I start MS Teams or Teams won't recognize my microphone. odd. since pavucontrol running fixes it, I figure there must be some way to automate this? without keeping the pavucontrol gui app running visibly on my desktop. what does it do? starts some service in the background perhaps?
Apr 23 10:58:25 <stemid>	or releases some lock, I can only speculate
Apr 23 11:00:24 <stemid>	pstree on its PID shows no tree.
Apr 23 11:07:36 <stemid>	I did this so far. added pavucontrol to autostarting programs. installed auto move window gnome extension and placed pavucontrol on workspace 2. that'll do I guess.

Apr 23 11:59:58 <FranciscoD>	rindolf: rpm -ql / rpmls
Apr 23 12:00:17 <FranciscoD>	for installed rpms, or dnf repopquery -l for packages in the repositories
Apr 23 12:00:32 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: ah, thanks
Apr 23 12:00:54 <FranciscoD>	rpm -q --provides will tell you the capabilities an installed rpm provides also
Apr 23 12:01:16 <FranciscoD>	and similarly dnf repoquery --provides applies to packages in the repos,
Apr 23 12:03:58 <rindolf>	FranciscoD: i want to search for a certain contained filename by pattern - dnf repoquery -l doesn't do that
Apr 23 12:09:51 <FranciscoD>	sudo dnf whatprovides '*/<filename>'?
Apr 23 12:10:00 <FranciscoD>	(sudo is optional, I always use the root cache)
Apr 23 12:10:33 <FranciscoD>	rpm -ql etc, give you the file list if you know the package name
Apr 23 12:10:48 <FranciscoD>	whatprovides tells you packages that contain/provide the capability

Apr 23 15:38:25 <CrazySam>	Fedora 31 comes with VBox GA preinstalled?
Apr 23 15:39:08 <CrazySam>	The VBox GA installer tells me that the system appears to have a version of it already installed.

Apr 23 17:42:43 <Khaytsus>	autopsy_: 1/3.
Apr 23 18:16:26 <ziff>	kk4ewt: not sure why, but after a full shutdown + power cycle (removed laptop battery and psu) my mobile broadband connection is working now. I did numerous reboots during troubleshooting, but that didn't help. Lets see if it keeps working.
Apr 23 18:16:44 <ziff>	kk4ewt: thanks again for your help
Apr 23 18:18:49 <ziff>	I had inserted the sim card while the laptop was running, maybe that was part of the problem
Apr 23 18:26:57 <kk4ewt>	Fedora 32 Final is GO
Apr 23 18:28:48 <ledeni>	kk4ewt, nice
Apr 23 18:35:44 <M_aD>	So the release is next week the 28th then
Apr 23 18:37:41 <kk4ewt>	@f32release
Apr 23 18:37:41 <fedbot>	Fedora 32 is planned for release on 2020-04-28, which is 4 days, 20 hours, 21 minutes, and 55 seconds from now
Apr 23 18:41:39 <Khaytsus>	Cool, missed the meeting today, was going to watch for it
Apr 23 18:44:42 <ledeni>	 kk4ewt, rc-1.6 will be final iso ?
Apr 23 18:45:57 <Khaytsus>	Yes
Apr 23 18:50:29 <ziff>	nice
Apr 23 19:00:53 <PPP999>	Hi
Apr 23 19:01:08 <PPP999>	I'm having an issue with grub2
Apr 23 19:01:22 <PPP999>	I have 3 entries for Fedora and I want to get rid of them
Apr 23 19:01:52 <PPP999>	Whenever I try "sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg" it doesn't list any of them
Apr 23 19:04:18 <prussian>	PPP999: I'd just use grubby
Apr 23 19:04:47 <prussian>	grubby --info=ALL; grubby --remove-kernel=...blah
Apr 23 19:04:50 <prussian>	etc
Apr 23 19:05:09 <prussian>	dealing with grub2 config is suffering in my opinion. one of the reasons I use systemd-boot
Apr 23 19:05:41 <PPP999>	Thanks I'll try it out
Apr 23 19:06:33 <cyberpear>	how do I launch a .sh file in Gnome?
Apr 23 19:07:10 <cyberpear>	(other than "open in terminal", then `./program.sh`?
Apr 23 19:07:33 <rindolf>	cyberpear: write a .desktop file?
Apr 23 19:08:01 <cyberpear>	then "open in terminal" then `./program.sh` is much faster...
Apr 23 19:08:17 <cyberpear>	I though once upon a time, I could just double-click the .sh file
Apr 23 19:08:32 <janos_>	is it executable?
Apr 23 19:08:35 <cyberpear>	yes
Apr 23 19:08:35 <rindolf>	cyberpear: right, if it's a one time thing
Apr 23 19:09:19 <rindolf>	cyberpear: behaviour like that made mswindows susceptible to worms
Apr 23 19:09:52 <cyberpear>	even a righ-click->execute would be helpful...
Apr 23 19:10:02 <ledeni>	cyberpear, check --> https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en
Apr 23 19:10:36 <cyberpear>	unfortunately, it'd have to be "convince third party to include .desktop file"
Apr 23 19:11:05 <rindolf>	cyberpear: why?
Apr 23 19:11:39 <kk4ewt>	cyberpear; or build one of your own which is not hard
Apr 23 19:11:42 <cyberpear>	because I regularly wipe the system and have to start from scratch
Apr 23 19:11:56 <cyberpear>	or I'm writing instructions for someone else
Apr 23 19:12:09 <rindolf>	cyberpear: then create an installer / setup script
Apr 23 19:13:53 <kk4ewt>	https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en
Apr 23 19:14:21 <tnelis>	Not sure I understand. When I double-click a shell script in Nautilus I am given the options to: "Run in Terminal", "Display", "Cancel" or "Run". Isn't that what you want?
Apr 23 19:14:44 <tnelis>	(You'll want to make sure that the program has a shebang and is marked executable.)
Apr 23 19:15:48 <janos_>	sounds like a missing shebang then - nautilus doesn't know what to launch with
Apr 23 19:15:59 <tnelis>	janos_
Apr 23 19:16:05 <tnelis>	janos_: My thinking as well.
Apr 23 19:28:09 <hiredman>	I've got a thunderbolt dock thing, which sometimes shows as charging my laptop when booted to fedora, but more often not, when in the bios it always shows as charging
Apr 23 19:28:27 <hiredman>	anyone have any idea what the deal with that could be?
Apr 23 19:32:46 <Khaytsus>	hiredman: is it charging?
Apr 23 19:36:06 <cyberpear>	tnelis: is there an extension to enable that? -- it just opens in gedit for me... it has a sheband line, and is marked +x
Apr 23 19:36:27 <hiredman>	Khaytsus: not according to anyway I can tell (upower and whatever polybar's battery module uses)
Apr 23 19:37:22 <hiredman>	powertop also shows as running on battery
Apr 23 19:43:37 <janos_>	cyberpear:in nautilus preference - behavior tab. Executable Text Files - has option "Run them". default set to "Display them"
Apr 23 19:44:18 <janos_>	there's also "Ask what to do"
Apr 23 19:44:25 <cyberpear>	janos++
Apr 23 19:45:10 <cyberpear>	janos_: exactly what I was looking for. thanks!
Apr 23 19:45:12 <PPP999>	I think I see the problem but I don't know how to fix it
Apr 23 19:45:22 <PPP999>	Every other OS says where it is on the disk
Apr 23 19:45:24 <janos_>	cyberpear: cool
Apr 23 19:45:28 <PPP999>	e.g /dev/sda
Apr 23 19:45:37 <PPP999>	the 3 entries for Fedora do not
Apr 23 19:45:48 <PPP999>	So that tells me they're found by os-prober
Apr 23 19:45:57 <PPP999>	Anyone know how to solve this?
Apr 23 19:48:54 <PPP999>	https://files.catbox.moe/u94d90.png
Apr 23 19:48:59 <PPP999>	Here's the partition scheme
Apr 23 19:52:03 <scr267>	Anyone know why starting a podman image would result in a "preparing rootfs caused \\\"permission denied\\\"\"": OCI runtime permission denied error" ?
Apr 23 19:52:31 <scr267>	I'm simply adding the "-v /home/<user>/somedir:/data/:Z" option
Apr 23 19:56:24 <Khaytsus>	scr267: try --systemd=false in your podman run
Apr 23 19:57:07 <Khaytsus>	scr267: Could also be cgroups v1 vs v2   and don't have any specific suggestions there
Apr 23 19:58:40 <scr267>	Khaytsus, I will try that
Apr 23 19:58:42 <scr267>	thanks
Apr 23 19:59:20 <Khaytsus>	Someone here a while back fiddled iwth cgroups to fix something along thoselines
Apr 23 19:59:37 <Khaytsus>	Now WHY?  No idea.  I've seen that too.  but I think in my case I fixed it with --systemd=false  I think.
Apr 23 20:01:01 <scr267>	Weird heh... well adding --systemd=false didn't work in my case it seems.  Thanks for the cgroups info though, I'll look for info about that.
Apr 23 20:02:00 <scr267>	oooooh geez, that sounds so familiar: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/fedora-31-control-group-v2
Apr 23 20:16:12 <prussian>	if you can, i'd recommend podman.
Apr 23 20:16:26 <prussian>	oh. didn't read enough
Apr 23 20:17:59 <yates_home>	where are the policy files that the "audit2allow -p" option requires on f31?
Apr 23 20:22:57 <yates_home>	if i just run audit2allow, i get this: https://paste.centos.org/view/9425d51e
Apr 23 20:24:05 <Khaytsus>	prussian: Podman is great, if you're on cgroups v1 I guess.  I have no idea what I'm on here.......  v2 I guess?  But podman works.  i dnno
Apr 23 20:29:57 <tnelis>	libpod/podman definitely support unified cgroups (cgroupv2). Moby/Docker was lagging a bit behind but I think it'll be supported in the next release or something (if not in the latest one already). There shouldn't be much reason to switch back to cgroupv1 in the near future.
Apr 23 21:14:37 <rindolf>	Hi all! Just letting you know that I've upgraded my f32 x64 sys to updates-testing, rebooted for the new kernel, and most everything seems to work smoothly - like before.
Apr 23 21:18:14 <rindolf>	Thanks all, and good night.
Apr 23 21:40:30 <Grinnz>	I'm not sure if it's how vmware has set it up, but Fedora seems to ignore Fedora live CDs when booting now and just boots to the installed OS. How do I get it to boot the CD?
Apr 23 21:41:52 <dowdle>	Grinnz: That would be your preferred boot device setting in your virt platform.
Apr 23 21:42:09 <Grinnz>	yeah nevermind, I just need to figure out what key to hit in the 0.5 seconds vmware allows me to. thanks
Apr 23 21:43:03 <Grinnz>	got it, esc
Apr 23 21:44:07 <Grinnz>	free version of vmware at least does not appear to have any setting for preferred boot device. oh well
Apr 23 21:52:37 <janos_>	impressive in the wrong way!
Apr 23 22:00:01 <Mordoc>	exit
Apr 23 22:02:45 <caterfxo>	ok. so, src.fedoraproject.org content is different from pagure.io content, right?

Apr 23 22:39:08 <mrvenkman>	Khaytsus, so I booted into windows
Apr 23 22:39:59 <mrvenkman>	And Windows crashed, with the new nbsod. (nice blue screen of death)
Apr 23 22:40:25 <mrvenkman>	Windows then offered to repair my Windows.
Apr 23 22:40:50 <mrvenkman>	And because I have a physical partition, I though yeh...
Apr 23 22:41:17 <mrvenkman>	So I think Windows has messed up my LVM

I keep getting the error Scanning not allowed while unavailable or activating.  iwlist does work.  I have tried to connect to a known ap, it says its unable to (via nmcli) and if i try to add one and connect it also does the same thing.
Apr 24 05:59:00 <phin>	Intel 8260 card.
Apr 24 05:59:43 <phin>	system worked with a previous 31 based silverblue and workstation setup.  Just attempting to do a minimal install as i do not want gnome on this.
Apr 24 06:02:10 <phin>	oh i was able to connect in the installer.  The install did create a nm profile.  this would not activate upon reboot
Apr 24 09:17:43 <StatelessCat>	Hi
Apr 24 10:10:42 <DTEIT>	phin: is the wifi enabled? what does nmcli radio wifi says?
Apr 24 13:55:08 <rindolf>	Hi all! I am also not fond of the default f32 updates-testing wallpaper. :(
Apr 24 13:57:00 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: Okay, I told them to cancel the release.
Apr 24 13:57:39 <Khaytsus>	Okay, it's done.  No 32.
Apr 24 13:57:39 <Khaytsus>	;)
Apr 24 13:58:04 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: heh
Apr 24 13:58:27 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: the one tha tlooks like it's..  grainy?
Apr 24 13:58:47 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: yes
Apr 24 13:59:12 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, it looks like it was rendered down to like..  16 colors ;)
Apr 24 13:59:28 <Khaytsus>	Maybe... 32 colors?
Apr 24 13:59:44 <Khaytsus>	;)
Apr 24 14:01:20 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: i think ubuntu should have made their bug no. 1 "release critical": https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Copying-Ubuntu-Bug-No-1/
Apr 24 14:02:47 <Khaytsus>	rindolf: 3 more years.  Windows will be a DE on Linux.
Apr 24 14:02:47 <Khaytsus>	And then we'll have to question is #1 fixed or not
Apr 24 14:05:38 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: BTW, any idea about https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/text/qt-and-firefox-update-graphics-artifacts-on-icewm-and-jwm-on-fedora32-x86_64.md ? should I report it on BZ?
Apr 24 14:05:39 <Khaytsus>	what in the world is this shlmifish thing?
Apr 24 14:07:51 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: shlomifish.org is my domain:
Apr 24 14:08:03 <Khaytsus>	oh
Apr 24 14:08:42 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: it is derived from my name: https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/your_name.xhtml
Apr 24 14:10:28 <Khaytsus>	Anywho, yes, log a bug I guess.  You just ranodmly test all the desktops or switching around or ?
Apr 24 14:12:09 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: i normally use plasma5 but sometime i use xfce or jwm/icewm
Apr 24 14:12:45 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: and i tested the issue in gnome3 for completeness' sake
Apr 24 14:26:07 <rindolf>	Khaytsus: thanks, i filed a ticket here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1827663
Apr 24 14:26:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	tWqaq, fix your connection please, one more bounce and i will remove you until you get it fixed
Apr 24 14:30:40 <jtagcat>	Docker repo is 404 on Fedora?
Apr 24 14:31:50 <rindolf>	jtagcat: hi
Apr 24 14:32:04 <rindolf>	jtagcat: what do you mean?
Apr 24 14:32:44 <jtagcat>	rindolf: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/ the repo mentioned there is 404
Apr 24 14:33:51 <billings>	or you could just use moby-engine
Apr 24 14:33:55 <jtagcat>	$ sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
Apr 24 14:33:58 <jtagcat>	Docker CE Stable - x86_64                       669  B/s | 577  B     00:00

Apr 24 14:33:58 *	fedbot sets quiet on *!jtagcat@193.40.103.87
Apr 24 14:34:39 *	fedbot removes quiet on *!jtagcat@193.40.103.87
Apr 24 14:34:44 <billings>	don't paste to the channel, use a pastebin like https://paste.centos.org
Apr 24 14:36:51 <rindolf>	jtagcat: you are on fedora 32 and that third party repo is only for f30 and f31
Apr 24 14:37:11 <rindolf>	jtagcat: you can try using podman instead
Apr 24 14:37:25 <billings>	BTW, moby-engine is just the open source version of Docker.  It still has the caveats of running Docker on modern fedora
Apr 24 14:38:39 <billings>	jtagcat: you've been unquieted, you don't need to PM me.
Apr 24 14:38:54 <jtagcat>	I facepalmed the moment I saw the paste come through..
Apr 24 14:42:24 <jtagcat>	What's the difference between podman and moby-engine? rindolf
Apr 24 14:43:07 <billings>	podman is a completely different container implementation
Apr 24 14:43:12 <billings>	moby-engine is docker's open source version
Apr 24 14:43:28 <billings>	(docker itself is not open source anymore.  jerks)
Apr 24 14:43:55 <billings>	(that was mostly tongue in cheek)
Apr 24 14:44:46 <Khaytsus>	jtagcat: Ask the Docker folks about their repo if you need to use it.  HOwever, you should see if podman suits your needs.
Apr 24 14:45:47 <jtagcat>	well I got my first mech kb from a friend I know and was told to use docker for flashing
Apr 24 14:45:54 <jtagcat>	https://pb.c7.ee/a205
Apr 24 14:46:32 <rindolf>	jtagcat: what does docker have to do with keyboards?
Apr 24 14:46:51 <Khaytsus>	nothing..  at all..
Apr 24 14:46:56 <rindolf>	jtagcat: do you mean a docking station?
Apr 24 14:46:56 <Khaytsus>	someone just put atmega in a docker file
Apr 24 14:47:19 <Khaytsus>	jtagcat: substitue docker for podman
Apr 24 14:47:19 <Khaytsus>	That simple.
Apr 24 14:47:25 <jtagcat>	I'm not very knowledgable on containers, as far as I know, he just throws everything in containers
Apr 24 14:48:19 <jtagcat>	What's the relation between docker and podman Khaytsus? iirc something about k8s?
Apr 24 14:48:51 <Khaytsus>	podman is an open source, root-less replacement for docker
Apr 24 14:48:51 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Southern_Gentlem
Apr 24 14:49:20 <jtagcat>	using search found me alias docker=podman
Apr 24 14:49:29 *	Southern_Gentlem sets ban on *!*@*240e:e0:bdba:d500:c51f:8dae:416e:4aba
Apr 24 14:49:29 *	fedbot has kicked tWqaq from #fedora (You are banned from this channel)
Apr 24 14:49:55 <Khaytsus>	Still unclear why you'd need a container at all for this qmk project
Apr 24 14:50:19 <jtagcat>	not sure as well
Apr 24 14:50:24 <jtagcat>	but I guess til more about containers
Apr 24 14:51:04 <jtagcat>	so moby is the open-source upstream for docker and podman is a drop-in replacement for docker (like sway is for i3) and better in some way?
Apr 24 14:51:43 <Khaytsus>	https://google.com/search?q=docker+vs+podman
Apr 24 14:51:45 <Khaytsus>	And seriously, you don't need a container here.
Apr 24 14:52:12 <Khaytsus>	https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started
Apr 24 14:52:36 <Khaytsus>	The only use a container really has here is not installing anything on the host os
Apr 24 14:53:32 <jtagcat>	well, thanks for your time
Apr 24 14:54:13 <Khaytsus>	100% sure that will just-work in podman
Apr 24 14:56:22 <Khaytsus>	Whole lot of weird obfuscation insttead of just following hte install docs
Apr 24 14:57:22 <Khaytsus>	 * The firmware size is fine - 24034/28672 (83%, 4638 bytes free)
Apr 24 14:57:37 <Khaytsus>	so yes, that worked just fine.. it's just put the compilation in docker files.

Oct 15 19:01:09 <The_Letter_M>	Any podman power users here?
Oct 15 19:04:57 <cmurf>	might try in #podman
Oct 15 19:16:13 <The_Letter_M>	Yeah. I asked my Q about using mariadb in a pod on Podman. They told me try asking in #maria and over there I got no response
Oct 15 19:17:26 <The_Letter_M>	The other response I got in #podman sounded like they don't know how to utilize pods
Oct 15 19:18:18 <Khaytsus>	Anything that works for docker should work in podman
Oct 15 19:18:43 <Khaytsus>	I wish there was a solid compose replacement, but just for runnong containers.. no biggie
Oct 15 19:26:07 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus Docker doesn't do pods
Oct 15 19:26:32 *	Khaytsus blinks
Oct 15 19:32:39 <The_Letter_M>	Ok. After looking it up, I am wrong; Docker does do pods.
Oct 15 19:32:43 <The_Letter_M>	Lol
Oct 15 19:33:03 <The_Letter_M>	I thought Pods were something that came from K8s
Oct 15 19:33:56 <Khaytsus>	I'm not quite sure what it has to do with what I said anyway
Oct 15 19:43:10 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus so I'm trying to deploy them inside a pod together. Being inside a pod they should beable to talk to each other using the pods internal network. I haven't seen any Docker compose files deploy a pod or container inside a pod.
Oct 15 19:44:42 <The_Letter_M>	Khaytsus: Ok so I should explain. I made a pod called "wordpress" and then I deployed a wordpress and mariadb container inside it. I used the options from the docker hub pages for both images, but the Wordpress site is saying it's having trouble connecting to the DB.

Oct 15 21:39:20 <hyperreal>	what are the recommended mount options for btrfs on fedora?
Oct 15 21:41:00 <cmurf>	hyperreal: defaults
Oct 15 21:41:39 <cmurf>	the rest are use case specific so you should be familiar with what they do
Oct 15 21:43:19 <memoryleak>	The_Letter_M: I understand your frustration, went through the same. What are the services running in your pod, only MariaDB?
Oct 15 21:43:51 <cmurf>	the one mount option that is recommended but not default due to detection limitations is: desktop usage on a hard drive (spinning) without significant database operations is to add 'autodefrag'
Oct 15 21:45:21 <cmurf>	unforunately detection of whether media is really rotating or not from sysfs is not reliable
Oct 15 21:45:31 <hyperreal>	cmurf: I see. I've heard people recommending 'ssd,noatime,space_cache,commit=120,compress=zstd'
Oct 15 21:45:43 <hyperreal>	I use an SSD
Oct 15 21:45:48 <hyperreal>	and nvme
Oct 15 21:45:56 <cmurf>	ssd mount option is autodetected reliably
Oct 15 21:47:26 <cmurf>	noatime is a tradeoff: less metadata writes due to atime updates once per day (for relatime, the default); but then things like cleaning up /var/tmp/ have to fallback to mtime (I think it's mtime)
Oct 15 21:47:47 <cmurf>	so some things get cleaned up more aggressively because mtime isn't updated on access
Oct 15 21:48:10 <cmurf>	so those files might be used, and atime updates would show that, but with noatime it looks like they aren't so they get thrown out
Oct 15 21:48:29 <cmurf>	space_cache is default already
Oct 15 21:48:37 <cmurf>	commit=30 is the default, not sure why you want 120
Oct 15 21:49:16 <cmurf>	compression is safe but you'll have to evaluate it for your use case; helps some and slows down others
Oct 15 21:49:38 <cmurf>	you can also lightening the level of compression so it takes less of a cpu hit with 'compress=zstd:1'
Oct 15 21:51:27 <cmurf>	s/lightening/lighten/
Oct 15 21:51:52 <hyperreal>	cmurf: okay, thank you

Oct 15 23:32:38 <VinAlencc404>	Hello, guys. How are you? I'd like to ask you something: on Debian, there's a repository called "backports" which brings recent updates to stable release. Is there something similar to it in Fedora? Would it be testing repositories?
Oct 15 23:34:45 <Sokel>	Testing is specifically for testing. when testing packages/updates pass and gets good karma, it gets pushed to the updates repo.
Oct 15 23:35:13 <Sokel>	I would not leave the "testing" repo enabled full time.
Oct 15 23:35:30 <VinAlencc404>	Sokel, got it. Thanks.
Oct 15 23:35:53 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404 just sudo dnf update will update you
Oct 15 23:36:44 <kk4ewt>	all updates for the stable release will be in the updates repo
Oct 15 23:36:49 <VinAlencc404>	kk4ewt, I know. But, do you know when there's a new version (like LibreOffice 7.0) and it's not into the official repo?
Oct 15 23:37:23 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404,  and when was that released
Oct 15 23:37:51 <VinAlencc404>	Let me check it
Oct 15 23:38:56 <kk4ewt>	i see packages for f33 of libreoffice 7
Oct 15 23:39:24 <kk4ewt>	you can always file a RFE Bugzilla  for f32
Oct 15 23:40:05 <kk4ewt>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=11024
Oct 15 23:41:09 <VinAlencc404>	LibreOffice 7.0 was released on August's first half
Oct 15 23:41:31 <VinAlencc404>	But, LibreOffice was just an example.
Oct 15 23:44:00 <Sokel>	not everything will get the latest in a fedora release. f33 may get libreoffice 7, but f32 may not. an rfe can be filed though to see if they will bring it to 32.
Oct 15 23:44:21 <VinAlencc404>	Got it.
Oct 15 23:48:34 <kk4ewt>	VinAlencc404,  koji is the fedora builder and bodhi is the test manager
Oct 15 23:51:01 <VinAlencc404>	kk4ewt, I'll check them. Thanks.

Oct 16 12:49:03 <lemonzest>	Yay, just a heads up, with todays gnome-flashback,panel,applets updates the gnome-flashback desktop is working again, until today colour calibration and bluetooth menus did not work, now do :) So I can use it as my main again :)
Oct 16 12:49:26 <fedora_sec>	Wait lemonzest what was the problem again?
Oct 16 12:50:40 <lemonzest>	the 33 beta version of the flashback desktop was a little buggy, in bluetooth menu it used to say not available (yet it was) and colour icc files did nothing, now both work for me on the 3.38 versions
Oct 16 12:51:03 <fedora_sec>	Ah that is annoying. What fedora system is that called? Just 33 beta?
Oct 16 12:51:29 <lemonzest>	oh sorry, Fedora 33 Workstation Beta
Oct 16 12:51:59 <lemonzest>	I just usually install the default gnome version, then install gnome-flashback and switch to that
Oct 16 12:52:35 <lemonzest>	in the gdm its called "GNOME Flashback (Metacity)"
Oct 16 12:52:41 <fedora_sec>	It's fine. I use Fedora Security Spin, partly because I like hacking distros but the other thing is that it is nice and fast even when connected to the 90V charger instead of the 135V charger on my Lenovo Thinkpad W510
Oct 16 12:54:56 <lemonzest>	I've been using Linux for close to 15 years, always liked gnome 2.0 style, used gnome-shell for a good 5 but always hated it, found out about gnome flashback an mate etc, switched to gnome flashback, nice and light :)

Oct 16 12:55:29 <fedora_sec>	Ah.
Oct 16 12:55:50 <fedora_sec>	That's nice to know. I just like any terminal as long as I'm using one that is fast and sleek
Oct 16 12:55:58 <lemonzest>	been using gnome classic shell for the past weeks and didn't like the feel
Oct 16 12:55:59 <akik>	wow so gnome-flashback is still available with metacity?
Oct 16 12:56:05 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:56:16 <akik>	+1 nice to know
Oct 16 12:56:19 <fedora_sec>	I especially like this one. In Fedora Security Spin
Oct 16 12:56:24 <fedora_sec>	+1 nice to know here too
Oct 16 12:56:33 <lemonzest>	for terms I use tilix :)
Oct 16 12:56:45 <fedora_sec>	Tilix? Is that installable?
Oct 16 12:56:49 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:57:24 <fedora_sec>	What's the package name?
Oct 16 12:57:50 <lemonzest>	tilix :P
Oct 16 12:58:09 <fedora_sec>	Ah thought so. Just checking to make sure what it was
Oct 16 12:58:36 <lemonzest>	its tabbed, like most, but can also split the windows/tabs
Oct 16 12:58:56 <fedora_sec>	That means I can have 2 terminals in one?
Oct 16 12:59:17 <lemonzest>	yup
Oct 16 12:59:31 <fedora_sec>	Coolio. I like using screen
Oct 16 13:00:29 <lemonzest>	tmux is a good replacement for screen
Oct 16 13:00:32 <fedora_sec>	I just don't like it sadly
Oct 16 13:00:41 <FranciscoD>	lemonzest: make that tmux with byobu :)
Oct 16 13:00:44 <FranciscoD>	even better
Oct 16 13:00:52 *	FranciscoD was a long time screen user and then moved to byobu + tmux
Oct 16 13:00:56 <fedora_sec>	I tried it, didn't like it. Thanks for telling me about it. I'll put it in my memory bank
Oct 16 13:01:03 <akik>	was a long time screen user and still am
Oct 16 13:01:18 <fedora_sec>	I'm going to have it installed just in case
Oct 16 13:01:24 <FranciscoD>	akik: when I'd checked, there were certain advantages of tmux over screen, but I can't remember them now
Oct 16 13:01:50 <lemonzest>	was a long time irssi user, one day switched to Hexchat and never left
Oct 16 13:01:54 <fedora_sec>	maybe that it tells you what commands your running at the bottom
Oct 16 13:02:05 <fedora_sec>	I use pidgin now
Oct 16 13:02:28 <akik>	FranciscoD: i know i don't need to move to it as screen does everything i need
Oct 16 13:02:38 <lemonzest>	i used to use pidgin for icq/aim/msn/yahoo etc
Oct 16 13:02:51 <FranciscoD>	lemonzest: i was irssi till I moved to weechat, primarily because of the slack plugin
Oct 16 13:02:53 <fedora_sec>	akik: Same here, I even installed it on my Raspberry Pi 4 and I use it in SSH
Oct 16 13:06:27 <fedora_sec>	Hey lemonzest: How do I change the color on tilix?
Oct 16 13:07:42 <lemonzest>	go the menu settings, then default, and its in there
Oct 16 13:08:44 *	lemonzest has dracla theme for everything lol
Oct 16 13:09:56 <fedora_sec>	Thanks lemonzest. Lol

Oct 16 20:07:43 <cmurf>	dbristow: I don't know what the split is but even if only 5% of people need to shrink their fs in a 12 month period, it's 100% inconvenient to have to reformat and reinstall as a work around for not having it.

Oct 16 21:20:42 <Caterpillar>	anyone with dual intel + nvidia laptop experiencing system suspension (in RAM) black screen issues?
Oct 16 21:21:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	dell?
Oct 16 21:21:50 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, which fedora release ? wayland or Xorg ?
Oct 16 21:22:03 <Caterpillar>	Southern_Gentlem: Thinkpat T540P, Xorg, Plasma. I am remotely helping a friend
Oct 16 21:22:05 <kwizart>	which nivdia driver ?
Oct 16 21:22:15 <Caterpillar>	I am collecting all infos now
Oct 16 21:22:22 <kwizart>	same
Oct 16 21:22:46 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: are you affected too?
Oct 16 21:23:09 <kwizart>	no, but I have a weird report from user using nvidia prop driver
Oct 16 21:24:31 <quippy>	could someone help me troubleshoot why my HDMI device produces no sound all of a sudden?
Oct 16 21:24:57 <quippy>	done a few reboots, tried a different HDMI device on the receiving end, clicked all the buttons in GNOME and in pavucontrol
Oct 16 21:25:03 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, what about a gdm restart ?
Oct 16 21:25:08 <quippy>	not sure what my next steps would be
Oct 16 21:26:12 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: no, the system is so frozen that you cannot SSH in it, you cannot use magic sys req.       System details   Fedora 32, nvidia driver 455.28-1.fc32 from @rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver     kernel   5.8.15-201.fc32.x86_64
Oct 16 21:27:13 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, looks very weird, seems a candidate for a full report to devtalk.nvidia.com using nvidia-bug-report.sh
Oct 16 21:27:34 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: thank you for the hint, I did not think about nvidia-bug-report.sh
Oct 16 21:27:40 <kwizart>	(even if before the system is frozen)
Oct 16 21:28:24 <quippy>	this is a recurring problem for me on 32
Oct 16 21:28:40 <quippy>	but I don't remember how it was fixed last time
Oct 16 21:30:34 <Arc>	Is there an alternative RPM source I can use for packages fedora hasn't bothered to package yet?
Oct 16 21:30:44 <Arc>	I'm on Fedora 32 and I can't figure out how to find the package that includes the postgis_sfcgal postgresql extension
Oct 16 21:31:10 <Arc>	it appears the package doesn't exist and postgis was compiled without it. Ubuntu packages it separately.
Oct 16 21:33:04 <quippy>	never mind i'm an idiot I turned off my speakers and forgot
Oct 16 21:33:33 <kwizart>	please ask questions to ask.fedoraproject.org if no answer from this channel

Oct 16 21:55:52 <Khaytsus>	Arc: is it not just postgis?
Oct 16 21:57:17 <Khaytsus>	Al, okay.. looks like no SFCGAL for Fedora, so not built into that postgis
Oct 16 22:06:44 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: do you know how to start Xorg with -logverbose 6  ?
Oct 16 22:07:06 <Caterpillar>	it's suggested in https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/if-you-have-a-problem-please-read-this-first/27131
Oct 16 22:07:14 <Caterpillar>	the login manager is sddm
Oct 16 22:15:33 <kwizart>	Caterpillar, well, run "startx -- -logverbose 6"
Oct 16 22:15:54 <kwizart>	eventually before systemctl isolate multi-user
Oct 16 22:32:33 <Caterpillar>	kwizart: mmh ok

Oct 16 23:17:22 <x033gg>	i am using two browsers on fedora chrome and fedora but unable to watch the videos, it just shows 0 percent.
Oct 16 23:17:42 <x033gg>	what plugin would i be missing to be able to watch some video that was working on my work laptop :P
Oct 16 23:17:47 <x033gg>	I just do not use winblows @ home
Oct 16 23:19:20 <x033gg>	 Gatzzzbeee
Oct 16 23:19:34 <daniel-wtd>	x033gg: for fedora you will need the rpm-fusion repo and the package ffmpeg-libs
Oct 16 23:19:49 <x033gg>	thanks
Oct 16 23:19:51 <daniel-wtd>	afterwards restart firefox and it will play almost everything
Oct 16 23:19:58 <daniel-wtd>	even netflix
Oct 16 23:20:06 <x033gg>	wow you are the man of the night
Oct 16 23:20:45 <daniel-wtd>	sudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
Oct 16 23:21:02 <daniel-wtd>	sudo dnf install ffmpeg-libs -y
Oct 16 23:21:08 <daniel-wtd>	should do the trick
Oct 16 23:23:48 <x033gg>	iget No match for argument: ffmpeg-libs
Oct 16 23:24:00 <x033gg>	oh wait i didnt see the whole thing
Oct 16 23:30:45 <x033gg>	if this works you are the man because at work they keep blocking me from education lmao :P
Oct 16 23:32:13 <x033gg>	yes!

Oct 17 00:06:45 <Arc>	Khaytsus: So back to the question, how do I get it on fedora?
Oct 17 00:07:03 <Arc>	if manual compilation is required the answer becomes "switch distros"
Oct 17 00:07:12 <Arc>	so I'm looking for an alternate RPM source
Oct 17 00:09:59 <Arc>	to repeat the question; I'm on Fedora 32 and I can't figure out how to find the package that includes the postgis_sfcgal postgresql extension. I'm looking for an alternate RPM source for gdal and sfcgal
Oct 17 00:12:06 <cmurf>	or build it in copr
Oct 17 00:12:26 <Arc>	if I'm manually building, I'm switching to gentoo.
Oct 17 00:12:39 <cmurf>	it's not manually building
Oct 17 00:12:46 <cmurf>	it's automatic, your own repo
Oct 17 00:13:53 <cmurf>	maybe someone's already done it, worth searching
Oct 17 00:14:00 <cmurf>	not sure how commont this extension is
Oct 17 00:15:21 <Arc>	within the GIS community its very common. But this is the problem using binary distros, someone else made a choice to limit what everyone else can do with it
Oct 17 00:16:58 <Arc>	everyone I'm working with is running arch, gentoo, or ubuntu. Within the GIS community Fedora is no bueno
Oct 17 00:22:37 <Dan39>	Arc: "GIS community"?
Oct 17 00:23:02 <Arc>	developers that work with GIS data
Oct 17 00:23:11 <Dan39>	lol
Oct 17 00:23:22 <Dan39>	nevemrind, bye
Oct 17 00:33:41 <Arc>	And that's why I keep switching to Gentoo. I don't know why I keep making the mistake of installing Fedora.

Oct 17 03:34:55 <grinchier>	hello all is there a usb wifi card I can buy that will work with secure boot?
Oct 17 03:36:15 <grinchier>	https://www.modio.se/installing-realtek-8821ce-driver-on-system-with-secureboot-enabled.html  trying to follow these instructions here but i must be doing something wrong
Oct 17 03:36:34 <grinchier>	I would just disable secure boot,  but on this hp laptop it magically re-enables itself after a week or two.
Oct 17 03:46:36 <terriblemistake>	guys, i need help. i added an nvme device to lvm. i created a lvm partition on it ("gpt"), created a pv, added it to the vm and extended the lv and the fs. everything worked until i rebooted.
Oct 17 03:47:24 <terriblemistake>	running lvm_scan in the recovery shell, i get "couldnt find device with uuid NNNN (last written to /dev/nvme0n1p1)
Oct 17 03:47:58 <der_Alte>	did you rerun dracut?đ
Oct 17 03:48:07 <terriblemistake>	i guess something went wrong with fedora reading the nvme device? someone could give me a light, please?
Oct 17 03:48:26 <terriblemistake>	no, i did not
Oct 17 03:49:29 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte, from here do you believe there's how to recover my OS?
Oct 17 03:50:34 <der_Alte>	well, yes, but you will need the recovery environment
Oct 17 03:50:58 <der_Alte>	adn make sure that nvme driver is loaded
Oct 17 03:51:04 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte oh sure, i am logged to the recovery shell atm
Oct 17 03:51:55 <der_Alte>	can you modprobe nvme ?
Oct 17 03:52:39 <terriblemistake>	this recovery shell doesn't have fdisk, lsblsk or cfdisk. i am checking dmesg now, looking for clues
Oct 17 03:52:45 <terriblemistake>	i will try
Oct 17 03:53:21 <der_Alte>	boot into recovery environment if you extended / FS
Oct 17 03:53:42 <der_Alte>	obviously that means eiher a DVD or USB key
Oct 17 03:54:05 <der_Alte>	or PXE if you have that on your local net
Oct 17 03:55:01 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte, i've just rebooted, and selected the rescue option, i see everything here
Oct 17 03:55:03 <terriblemistake>	my files, etc
Oct 17 03:55:45 <terriblemistake>	like, my root partition, everything is here. lvm is fine here
Oct 17 03:57:22 <der_Alte>	mount the root fs
Oct 17 03:58:08 <der_Alte>	and then rebuild initramfs with dracut for *the version of the kernel* that is in grub2 menu
Oct 17 03:59:14 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte root fs is mounted, everything seems fine in this rescue mode
Oct 17 03:59:29 <terriblemistake>	ok, will do. i am doing a last time backup first
Oct 17 03:59:59 <der_Alte>	check devices with lsblk
Oct 17 04:00:31 <terriblemistake>	all devices are here, everything is really fine here in this rescue mode
Oct 17 04:02:57 <tidux>	terriblemistake: sounds like you just forgot to add a driver to your initramfs with dracut
Oct 17 04:06:17 <terriblemistake>	right. so basically, i should run dracut --regenerate-all 5.8.15 ?
Oct 17 04:08:23 <terriblemistake>	tidux, i guess so. i didn't know i would need to deal with dracut
Oct 17 04:09:19 <terriblemistake>	it's weird though that the rescue mode found everything. after i typed in the root passwd, i got logged in with everything mounted and all
Oct 17 04:11:00 <terriblemistake>	actually, i think it's dracut --regenerate-all --kver 5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64
Oct 17 04:11:22 <der_Alte>	because it has the nvme driver in initramfs
Oct 17 04:11:49 <terriblemistake>	der_Alte sound good? just asking to ensure i won't make it worse
Oct 17 04:12:17 <der_Alte>	make sure that you include the nvme driver
Oct 17 04:13:06 <der_Alte>	man dracut
Oct 17 04:13:30 <terriblemistake>	k
Oct 17 04:17:49 <terriblemistake>	works, der_Alte, thanks a lot

Oct 17 18:37:42 <sdgathman>	rsyslogd[847]: imjournal from <elissa:psi-notify>: begin to drop messages due to rate-limiting
Oct 17 18:37:52 <sdgathman>	rsyslog is really bogging the system down
Oct 17 18:38:00 <sdgathman>	That is in the journalctl
Oct 17 18:38:39 <Khaytsus>	Seriously doubt rsyslog is bogging anything down
Oct 17 18:38:39 <sdgathman>	I turned off rsyslog service.  Hope it's not essential
Oct 17 18:38:58 <sdgathman>	It was absolutely rsyslogd
Oct 17 18:39:03 <Khaytsus>	..k
Oct 17 18:39:11 <Khaytsus>	Anyway, no, rsyslog has been optional for several releases
Oct 17 18:39:26 <sdgathman>	Now, it might be something trying to send it a %^&$ ton of messages ...
Oct 17 18:39:48 <sdgathman>	Anyway, back to normal after stopping it.
Oct 17 18:39:57 <sdgathman>	I might disable it if not really needed.
Oct 17 18:40:27 <sdgathman>	rsyslogd[847]: imjournal: ignoring invalid state file /var/lib/rsyslog/imjournal.state [v8.2008.0]
Oct 17 18:41:16 <sdgathman>	Another error it got that might be triggering the problem
Oct 17 18:44:21 <cornyst>	Khaytsus: Sorry! When you stated PA suspended, I probably incorrectly assuned you meant pulseaudio!
Oct 17 18:44:40 <cornyst>	Assumed
Oct 17 18:45:56 <Khaytsus>	cornyst: yep, that' what I meant, pulseaudio
Oct 17 18:47:49 <Khaytsus>	cornyst: I very rarely have any issues with PA, this one was an odd one.  Still confused what was going on, I'll have to reboot later to see if it recurrs but right now I need audio
Oct 17 18:48:21 <cmurf>	best guess is if rsyslog enabled, then you probably want journald conf storage set to volatile
Oct 17 18:49:42 <cmurf>	or you can set storage=none
Oct 17 18:50:08 <cmurf>	syslog socket still works when storage=none
Oct 17 18:51:52 <Khaytsus>	Yeah I think he's fixed a symptom not a problem, but anywho
Oct 17 19:02:07 <sdgathman>	I'm on a job, so I can't dig into the actual problem.  Stopping rsyslogd let's me continue working...
Oct 17 19:02:37 <sdgathman>	Upgrading a client from c5 (!) to c8 ...
Oct 17 19:03:09 <sdgathman>	Also dead disk on the raid array.
Oct 17 19:03:19 <cmurf>	eek
Oct 17 19:04:45 <sdgathman>	It's not that bad, fresh install of c8, copy stuff over from remaining good disk.
Oct 17 19:06:01 <cmurf>	i'm not super familiar with rsyslog so i'm not sure why it would become busy
Oct 17 19:06:28 <cmurf>	if anything it receives less information on the syslog socket and should have as much stuff to write out
Oct 17 19:09:37 <cmurf>	should ^not have
Oct 17 19:25:57 <Khaytsus>	Let me guess, you're doing some insane in-place upgrade using some method you came up with
Oct 17 19:29:34 <cmurf>	he said fresh install and copy over so i don't think it's in-place
Oct 17 19:30:14 <cmurf>	perf top -p PID might reveal some clue why
Oct 17 19:32:14 <cmurf>	bcc-tools has some neat tools for narrowing down various sources of latency

Oct 17 22:58:10 <cmurf>	akik: maybe more verbose output would help
Oct 17 22:58:27 <cmurf>	or possibly there's a malformed drop-in config in /etc ?
Oct 17 23:04:35 <akik>	cmurf: do you mean i should try to re-create the initramfs with dracut? i removed 5.18.15 packages for now
Oct 17 23:04:47 <cmurf>	it's a new error?
Oct 17 23:04:56 <cmurf>	just 5.18.15?
Oct 17 23:04:58 <akik>	the kernel updates so fast i don't mind skipping a version
Oct 17 23:05:03 <akik>	cmurf: yes new error
Oct 17 23:06:43 <cmurf>	hmm weird
Oct 17 23:07:09 <cmurf>	it's either a location configuration triggering it or it's a bug (or both)
Oct 17 23:07:29 <cmurf>	anything unique about the installation?
Oct 17 23:07:36 <akik>	cmurf: i can run that dracut-install command manually
Oct 17 23:07:58 <cmurf>	yeah but why '-m btrfs'
Oct 17 23:08:00 <akik>	i mean in a minute
Oct 17 23:08:41 <akik>	cmurf: this system has /boot on ext3 and / and /home on btrfs
Oct 17 23:09:05 <cmurf>	maybe dracut sees / on btrfs and adds -m btrfs
Oct 17 23:09:20 <cmurf>	but why would it fail
Oct 17 23:10:32 <cmurf>	can you post the entire journal somewhere?
Oct 17 23:10:57 <akik>	cmurf: yes just a minute, it's installing now
Oct 17 23:10:59 <cmurf>	journalctl -b --no-hostname -o short-monotonic
Oct 17 23:12:40 <cmurf>	i don't see anything btrfs related in the 5.8.15 kernel commits for fc31
Oct 17 23:12:42 <cmurf>	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/kernel/c/67f15457dbf3534ecfebd1216752dc88e172642b?branch=f31
Oct 17 23:13:26 <cmurf>	dracut on fc31 was last update in May so that's probably not the cause
Oct 17 23:15:57 <akik>	the journalctl -b 0 outputs 30k lines
Oct 17 23:16:05 <akik>	are you sure you need that?
Oct 17 23:23:55 <akik>	cmurf: ok i get the same error with: dracut -f /boot/initramfs-5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64.img 5.8.15-101.fc31.x86_64
Oct 17 23:24:55 <cmurf>	hmmmm
Oct 17 23:25:48 <cmurf>	can you add --debug
Oct 17 23:25:55 <cmurf>	and then post the output somewhere
Oct 17 23:26:30 <akik>	cmurf: the error comes after this line: Oct 18 01:23:36 ac dracut[200478]: *** Including modules done ***
Oct 17 23:26:38 <akik>	sure
Oct 17 23:30:58 <akik>	cmurf: here's the logfile for dracut --debug: https://transfer.sh/aBDp3/dracut.log
Oct 17 23:35:05 <cmurf>	what's the most recent successful kernel you've tried?

Oct 17 23:35:50 <akik>	cmurf: i'm on 5.18.13 now
Oct 17 23:36:27 <akik>	cmurf: i can try re-installing 5.18.13 to see if i missed that error
Oct 17 23:36:51 <cmurf>	any difference in the /boot/config file for 5.18.13 and 5.18.15? i.e. grep BTRFS /config/config...
Oct 17 23:37:01 <cmurf>	good idea
Oct 17 23:37:39 <akik>	cmurf: no, just two lines with the kernel versions
Oct 17 23:37:44 <akik>	differences that is
Oct 17 23:38:38 <cmurf>	do the configs show btrfs is a module or built-in
Oct 17 23:40:29 <akik>	CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=y
Oct 17 23:40:47 <cmurf>	hmm
Oct 17 23:40:48 <cmurf>	for both?
Oct 17 23:40:55 <cmurf>	13 and 15
Oct 17 23:41:10 <cmurf>	but yeah good idea to see if the error happens with dracut -f for .13
Oct 17 23:41:14 <cmurf>	no debug needed
Oct 17 23:44:17 <akik>	cmurf: yes =y for both
Oct 17 23:44:28 <cmurf>	interesting
Oct 17 23:47:06 <cmurf>	so i think you're going to see the same error for 5.8.13
Oct 17 23:47:09 <cmurf>	but it's non-fatal
Oct 17 23:47:16 <cmurf>	there is not btrfs modue
Oct 17 23:47:26 <cmurf>	i think that version of dracut isn't expecting btrfs to be built-in
Oct 17 23:48:18 <cmurf>	5.8 series was the first to have it set to built-in instead of as a module
Oct 17 23:48:53 <akik>	cmurf: ok i'm getting the same error on 5.8.13 too
Oct 17 23:49:14 <cmurf>	yeah i think it's not fatal based on your debug log
Oct 17 23:49:49 <akik>	ok thanks
Oct 17 23:49:51 <cmurf>	it is technically a bug i think
Oct 17 23:50:06 <cmurf>	if you want to file a bug against dracut you can so others find it
Oct 17 23:52:16 <Time-Warp>	looking for matthew miller
Oct 17 23:58:31 <cmurf>	but fc32 has the same version of dracut
Oct 17 23:58:37 <cmurf>	so why doesn't this problem  happen there?

Oct 18 00:36:06 <rakee>	Just installed fedora on my host and I am using it to stream video from nfs using vlc, but it seems to consume disc space for some reason (nothing else is running). /{home,opt,root,run,srv,sys,tmp,usr,var} are all constant according to du -sh ... any idea why this occurs? thanks!
Oct 18 00:42:16 <kk4ewt>	it has to download it into something to play it
Oct 18 00:42:32 <kk4ewt>	usually into var
Oct 18 00:42:37 <kk4ewt>	or tmp
Oct 18 00:42:55 <rakee>	kk4ewt, yes, so I thought, but both are constant in size
Oct 18 00:45:06 <kk4ewt>	ram or swap
Oct 18 00:47:28 <rakee>	kk4ewt, it makes df -h / output grow smaller, swap shouldn't do that now should it?
Oct 18 01:00:13 <kk4ewt>	what is growing smaller
Oct 18 01:00:37 <kk4ewt>	root yes becasue tmp comes out of /
Oct 18 01:00:37 <rakee>	kk4ewt, /
Oct 18 01:01:08 <rakee>	kk4ewt, isn't /tmp a tmpfs so it shouldn't show up, now should it
Oct 18 01:01:29 <kk4ewt>	it is still part of /
Oct 18 01:01:33 <rakee>	anyway on my system it's tmpfs and it's completely empty
Oct 18 01:01:54 <kk4ewt>	you are fine, your system is fine
Oct 18 01:02:05 <rakee>	so what? df -h shows filesystems not paths
Oct 18 01:02:22 <kk4ewt>	yes
Oct 18 01:03:36 <rakee>	kk4ewt, well why is / fs getting populated then? proportionally to video stream
Oct 18 01:04:12 <rakee>	du -sh  /{home,opt,root,run,srv,sys,tmp,usr,var} is constant on all accounts
Oct 18 01:04:45 <rakee>	and du -sh /mnt (where nfs is mounted) seems pointless
Oct 18 01:05:42 <kk4ewt>	df -h |fpaste
Oct 18 01:05:42 <kk4ewt>	mount |fpaste
Oct 18 01:13:12 <rakee>	kk4ewt, https://paste.centos.org/view/a2b8ed0d https://paste.centos.org/view/d44eb080
Oct 18 01:18:55 <rakee>	https://paste.centos.org/view/a2b8ed0d https://paste.centos.org/view/d44eb080
Oct 18 01:19:12 <rakee>	just in case you didn't get it
Oct 18 01:25:20 <cmurf>	rakee: the only think a bit out of the ordinary is /dev/shm seems high to me
Oct 18 01:25:24 <cmurf>	tmpfs           5.9G     0  5.9G   0% /dev/shm
Oct 18 01:25:26 <cmurf>	that's what i get
Oct 18 01:26:14 <rakee>	cmurf, shm started to be filled after root partition went to 0
Oct 18 01:27:11 <cmurf>	hmm
Oct 18 01:27:34 <cmurf>	oh yeah missed that :P
Oct 18 01:27:37 <cmurf>	/dev/mapper/fedora_localhost--live-root   40G   38G  916K 100% /
Oct 18 01:27:40 <cmurf>	that's odd
Oct 18 01:28:27 <cmurf>	what do you get for swapon
Oct 18 01:29:30 <cmurf>	tell you what though, you might do a kind of "emergency" delete of some things you can spare to avoid running out of space on /
Oct 18 01:29:36 <cmurf>	otherwise it'll get cranky
Oct 18 01:30:07 <rakee>	cmurf, don't have swap
Oct 18 01:30:10 <cmurf>	one of the things  you can do without in the short term is /var/cache/dnf/
Oct 18 01:30:37 <cmurf>	you can just rm -rf that, it'll free up maybe 30MB
Oct 18 01:30:53 <rakee>	already deleted some files a day or so ago, but that only postpones it
Oct 18 01:30:56 <cmurf>	another one is /var/cache/PackageKit/ - maybe 100MB or so
Oct 18 01:31:27 <cmurf>	yeah but 916K is basically zero, this is just to give you breathing room right now so you can find the real problem
Oct 18 01:31:49 <rakee>	moved close to 10G to the nfs, went down real fast after streaming from the nfs again
Oct 18 01:31:58 <rakee>	good call, yeah
Oct 18 01:32:10 <cmurf>	i don't know why streaming would affect space on /
Oct 18 01:32:42 <cmurf>	i don't see /home
Oct 18 01:32:45 <cmurf>	is it on / ?
Oct 18 01:32:52 <rakee>	yup
Oct 18 01:33:00 <rakee>	it's a single purpose machine really, just for streaming
Oct 18 01:33:04 <cmurf>	ok so maybe the real issue is going on in /home
Oct 18 01:33:07 <cmurf>	oh
Oct 18 01:33:08 <cmurf>	i see
Oct 18 01:33:28 <rakee>	according to du -sh, /home remained constant throughout all this
Oct 18 01:33:35 <cmurf>	ok
Oct 18 01:33:46 <cmurf>	du -sh /var
Oct 18 01:33:48 <cmurf>	what's that look like
Oct 18 01:34:08 <rakee>	1.8G
Oct 18 01:34:34 <cmurf>	yeah not bad, mines 23G
Oct 18 01:34:43 <cmurf>	haha wait why is it 23G?!
Oct 18 01:34:48 <cmurf>	oh VM's nevermind
Oct 18 01:34:51 <rakee>	 /var/cache is taking up close to 700, spool another 500
Oct 18 01:35:07 <cmurf>	spool contains an abrt dir, could be coredumps in there

Oct 18 01:35:55 <cmurf>	but also not sure where your free space normally is before the current situation
Oct 18 01:36:04 <cmurf>	anyway it's process of elimination to find out what's eating the space
Oct 18 01:36:21 <cmurf>	fatrace might be useful if you're looking for a heavy writer of something
Oct 18 01:38:41 <rakee>	don't know that one, but what would I trace? vlc? that'd have to be in /home ... not sure how to trace the nfs ecosystem
Oct 18 01:38:57 <rakee>	oh, it's systemwide
Oct 18 01:41:29 <cmurf>	you can trace whatever you want with -c
Oct 18 01:41:42 <rakee>	cmurf, brace yourself, it was a user zombie process (simplescreenrecorder) that apparently kept 29G somewhere on the drive
Oct 18 01:41:56 <cmurf>	just cd to the dir of the fs you want and then use -c and it'll only trace that fs
Oct 18 01:42:05 <cmurf>	but it shows everything happening on it
Oct 18 01:42:12 <cmurf>	haha!
Oct 18 01:42:22 <rakee>	thanks for your help though, I will look into fatrace ... looks interesting
Oct 18 01:43:53 <cmurf>	file access trace :)
Oct 18 01:55:40 <cmurf>	akik: well i'm stuck, no changes in dracut and yet this error doesn't happen on f33 where btrfs is also built-in

Oct 19 12:55:05 <amharris>	Hi, folks!  I've used (GNU/)Linux for quite a long time overall but have been away from using it on my own machines for a fair number of years, (aside from when I have scriptable, headless instances).  Got Fedora (33 beta) spun up on a new mini PC [ASUS PN50 - AMD Renior (4800U)] and it's all running smoothly, but I'm having an odd problem I'm trying to figure out.
Oct 19 12:57:46 <fedora_sec>	What's the odd problem?
Oct 19 12:58:11 <amharris>	In short, whether at high loads or idling, the system will eventually and intermittently crash to a black screen.  I'm not sure if it's GNOME, but it seems to be a fairly messy state.  If I press the power button (to go into suspend), it'll then spit out errors in a text interface, but I basically have to hard reset [at least so far].
Oct 19 12:58:27 <fedora_sec>	Are you using KDE?
Oct 19 12:58:36 <amharris>	Nope.  GNOME; bog-standard Workstation.
Oct 19 12:58:45 <amharris>	on Wayland (and Btrfs).
Oct 19 12:59:09 <[Enrico]>	amharris: can you switch to tty and check if there is any kernel message / trace ?
Oct 19 12:59:12 <amharris>	Not sure if it's a problem with Renior, given it's still fairly recent, or if it's 33; or a combination.
Oct 19 12:59:40 <fedora_sec>	Ah wayland. Does the computer automatically lock itself? Because I was using Parrot OS and when it tried to lock itself, it would freeze because it didn't have the right thing to lock itself, so I switched off the auto locking and switched the rendering too
Oct 19 13:01:09 <amharris>	[Enrico]: Yeah, I tried to jump into the logs and system logs sometimes throw a warning of access.  I don't think I've ever 'main'-ed GNOME 3 (and it's been so long since I've played around with a new setup; last Linux workstation was on Debian Wheezy with OpenBox ...yup!).
Oct 19 13:01:30 <[Enrico]>	amharris: it also looks like you system doesn't die, it's just the screen going black so you can check the syslog for those
Oct 19 13:01:36 <amharris>	[Enrico]: I'm at work right now, but I'll get as much info as I can when I get home.
Oct 19 13:01:56 <[Enrico]>	amharris: also: use the sysrq to restart the system if it happens, don't use the power button (but you need to enable the sysrq to do so, they are disabled by default)
Oct 19 13:01:58 <amharris>	[Enrico]: hehe, hence my little explanation above. ;-)
Oct 19 13:02:55 <Khaytsus>	If not suggested yet, try the Xorg (Classic) login vs Wayland.
Oct 19 13:03:00 <[Enrico]>	amharris: to enable: echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' > /etc/sysctl.d/sysrq.conf
Oct 19 13:03:24 <amharris>	Not sure if it's relevant at all but having never really had more of a business-orientated system before, I didn't really think about 1.2V for the DRAM and got 1.35V 3200MHz memory instead (but not at JEDEC spec and only XMP); listed as compatible but it clocks it down to 2666MHz at 1.2V.  Not sure if that's relevant at all.
Oct 19 13:04:25 <[Enrico]>	amharris: that would be a point for the hardware vendor, not for Fedora people I suppose, we can only speculate on that topic :)
Oct 19 13:05:10 <amharris>	[Enrico]: Albeit a touch embarrassing, I've never actually used SysRq.  Though I get the basics of what it does, what's the reason you're suggesting/requesting I use it to restart the system?
Oct 19 13:05:35 <amharris>	[Enrico]: True, true.  Just throwing it out there in case there's an "aha!  I've seen/heard about this before." :-)
Oct 19 13:06:13 <[Enrico]>	amharris: with the sysrq equence s u b, you will sync the cache to disk (s), remount everything read only (u), and then reset (b). This is a way of shutting down with less risk of corrupting the file system
Oct 19 13:10:50 <amharris>	[Enrico]: Ah, fab—just what I like. :-)  I hope that worst case it'd just be a few bits being flipped and not a risk of a borked install [with hard resets]. >.<
Oct 19 13:11:56 <[Enrico]>	amharris: without sysrq the chances of having a borked install are much lower I'd say
Oct 19 13:12:47 <amharris>	[Enrico]: Do you mean 'with'?

Oct 19 13:49:45 <amharris>	Southern_Gentlem: Ah, right.  Well, so long as I can find a way to avoid using VirtualBox and still run my Vagrant instances for scripts and frameworks that expect to see VirtualBox, then that's all I need.  I really want to avoid using it and only need it for projects where it's headless anyway.
Oct 19 13:52:30 <kwizart>	Southern_Gentlem, it shouldn't be needed to reboot since kernel 3.13 or something. You still cannot use vbox and kvm at the same time, but no reboot should be needed
Oct 19 13:56:04 <Khaytsus>	amharris: It's trivial to make vagrant use kvm
Oct 19 13:57:02 <amharris>	Khaytsus: Yeah, I appreciate that.  'Tis more a matter of if Laravel gets in the way as I believe it expects to see one of the four I mentioned.  I'm sure it'll work, based off of what you've said.  I'll keep you posted.

Oct 20 14:04:24 <[Enrico]>	amharris: in the past I had a computer where a buggy EC / BIOS was causing issues with the SATA controller. In some conditions the SATA controller would become unresponsive, thus leaving Fedora with no OS disk / partition any longer and the file system would hang

Nov 06 21:52:22 <cmurf>	aarch64 image are made with oz-imagefactory
Nov 06 21:52:35 <cmurf>	Gaffel: ^^
Nov 06 21:53:36 <[R]>	oz? but then wouldn't all the bits be upside down?
Nov 06 21:54:12 <Gaffel>	cmurf, thank you. Doesn't that require a VM that can execute the target architecture ISA?
Nov 06 21:54:32 <cmurf>	*shrug* not sure
Nov 06 21:54:47 <cmurf>	it might work in a container
Nov 06 21:56:05 <cmurf>	oh i see, best to actually comprehend the question
Nov 06 21:56:15 <akik>	Gaffel: qemu can emulate arm, maybe that's how it's used
Nov 06 21:57:27 <cmurf>	but my answer is still the same, not sure - but chances are that's not possible in a container
Nov 06 21:59:06 <cmurf>	hmmm well, there's no compiling happening to build the image, it's basically partition->file system->extract from rpm->copy/move into position->bootloader
Nov 06 22:02:02 <Gaffel>	oz uses libvirt for installing packages. I might be looking at something old.

Nov 06 22:11:48 <Han>	Southern_Gentlem, I might have found it: https://askubuntu.com/questions/999680/libinput-change-touchpad-2-finger-and-3-finger-clicks

Nov 07 20:47:15 <RunLevelRobot>	hello everybody
Nov 07 20:52:09 <RunLevelRobot>	i am so happy to finally be on Fedora 33. This release is nice. :)
Nov 07 21:47:42 <mershl>	Is it possible to "dnf download mesa" to get every mesa rpm that is usually installed?
Nov 07 21:50:26 <dowdle>	mershl: dnf download mesa*
Nov 07 21:54:35 <mershl>	Thanks dowdle!
Nov 07 22:24:42 <cmurf>	sdgathman: you're having ipp problems out of the box? hmmm there's a test case for this
Nov 07 22:25:49 <felixi>	i have a totally random question. Why was yum renamed dnf?
Nov 07 22:26:15 <mershl>	It rolls better of the tongue.
Nov 07 22:26:27 <cmurf>	Khaytsus: yeah possibly the first indication of an issue with swap on zram could be earlyoom killing off firefox tabs
Nov 07 22:26:32 <felixi>	yum sounds tasty :]
Nov 07 22:27:39 <bugs_>	dnf = dandified yum
Nov 07 22:27:51 <bugs_>	dnf short for dandified
Nov 07 22:28:00 *	felixi digs dandified from dictionary
Nov 07 22:28:54 <cmurf>	but earlyoom (workstation 32/33, kde 33) is expected to log it, so something like:
Nov 07 22:29:07 <cmurf>	journalctl -b | grep 'SIGTERM\|SIGKILL'
Nov 07 22:29:10 <cmurf>	should show it

Jan 26 21:42:47 <cmurf>	_AnK: thanks, how big was the file?
Jan 26 21:42:57 <cmurf>	i wonder if this is raid1 related or if it's the size of the file
Jan 26 21:43:23 <cmurf>	i'm not sure how system monitor is trying to get file system information, if it's using a gtk or glib or glibc api or what
Jan 26 21:43:56 <cmurf>	i guess once we find out how system monitor gets this information, we can figure out whose bug it is
Jan 26 21:56:10 <_AnK>	about 4G - copy of DVD.
Jan 26 21:56:53 <_AnK>	I guess step number one is to reproduce the problem independently.
Jan 26 21:57:20 <_AnK>	To confirm the observation and isolate the cause.
Jan 26 21:59:18 <_AnK>	Wonder if other people observe the same. You mentioned someone, correct?
Jan 26 22:02:26 <fmlatghor>	d9k: I logged in and out of my account after getting rid of my .zshrc/.zprofile (actually moving it to another folder temporarily), but I still have the problem with gnome-terminal and xterm. I've considered creating a new account, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trouble.
Jan 26 22:11:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	fmlatghor, about the only way to tell if its your account or the machine
Jan 26 22:11:48 <fmlatghor>	it is my account
Jan 26 22:12:03 <fmlatghor>	I created a new account and changed the she -- oh wait
Jan 26 22:12:12 <fmlatghor>	I didn't try logging in via gdm
Jan 26 22:16:08 <fmlatghor>	yep it worked for a test account I can say confidently
Jan 26 22:23:31 <fmlatghor>	I give up on fixing it, I'm just going to run zsh as a custom command and the next time I do an install then I won't have to worry about it.
Jan 26 22:23:51 <fmlatghor>	I wouldn't have this problem to begin with if I just didn't do stupid things.
Jan 26 22:46:30 <m0lle767>	Im trying to set a custom font in gnome-terminal but im having trouble understanding why theres only 5 different fonts to choose from in the list, when there are over 100 installed fonts in my system
Jan 26 22:49:20 <w00dsman>	if you install gnome-tweaks, then go to the fonts section, then change the monospace font to whatever, in gnome-terminal it'll use that

Jan 27 18:45:26 <linuxmodder>	thunar or caja work
Jan 27 18:46:03 <Khaytsus>	I guess it depends on what you need to do..  but I can't help much here, I have very little use for gui file managers.  Closest I ever get is purely for picutres like with geeque
Jan 27 18:46:07 <Khaytsus>	geeqie
Jan 27 18:46:44 <linuxmodder>	Khaytsus,  you a cli + mc kinda user then ?
Jan 27 18:47:11 <linuxmodder>	or is there some other fancy tui file manager you use
Jan 27 18:47:12 <Khaytsus>	File managers in general thing, really..
Jan 27 18:47:25 <linuxmodder>	just not gui ones eh?
Jan 27 18:47:25 <Khaytsus>	And no, mc can die in nuclear fire
Jan 27 18:47:47 <linuxmodder>	woah! but of hatred there
Jan 27 18:47:53 <Khaytsus>	Yeah I guess just in general I have no use for file managers.  I used to one one called gentoo but mostly to assist in cleaning up cluteterd homedirs etc
Jan 27 18:47:59 <linuxmodder>	so what other fm are there that arent gui
Jan 27 18:48:20 <Khaytsus>	I messed with one once....  ranger?  but again, never found much use for it
Jan 27 18:48:21 <Mershl[m]>	I know quite a lot of people that swear on Ranger
Jan 27 18:48:27 <Mershl[m]>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger
Jan 27 18:48:37 <Khaytsus>	I mostly swear at file managers
Jan 27 18:48:42 <linuxmodder>	lol
Jan 27 18:51:34 <Mershl[m]>	I just can't grasp why Nautilus is not fixing its issues. For the last 5-10 years I seem to see the same problems again and again. Truly unreliable copy to network drives, taking 5 seconds to boot if you have a harddrive mount (async? nope!), sushi (file previewer) has been broken for several months, every compressed file has the Extract here command in a different spot of the context menu, copy's estimates are worse than
Jan 27 18:51:34 <Mershl[m]>	random...
Jan 27 18:54:40 <Mershl[m]>	Sorry for the short rant. I had a meeting with "real life" today, my bank needed me to download documents from a web portal. The documents included forms and it was truly horrible. 1.) The web portal blocks Firefox. "Use Chrome" 2.) Switching pages on the pdf in Evince took 10 seconds on an NVME drive. 3.) Saving the forms in Evince corrupted the pdf and the webportal was no longer accepting it.
Jan 27 18:55:08 <Khaytsus>	I hate PDF forms
Jan 27 18:55:28 <Mershl[m]>	Me too. But normal people love them.
Jan 27 18:57:50 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, because adobe's pdf stuff handles it fine I guess
Jan 27 18:57:51 <Khaytsus>	I wonder if qpdfview would work better..  I have been using it as a viewer for some time now
Jan 27 18:57:51 <linuxmodder>	qpdfview has been my go to as well
Jan 27 18:57:51 <Khaytsus>	It does take some odd tweaking to get working 'right' though.. like it default to some SUPER LOW ram usage values, decodes one page at a time, some other stuff..  forget
Jan 27 18:57:51 <Khaytsus>	Easily tweaked in its prefrences, nothing complicated

Jan 27 21:29:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	doesnt mean it was correct then no idea how it worked
Jan 27 21:29:43 <Ben_1>	Southern_Gentlem: I had the hope that a dnf update fixes the issue but no
Jan 27 21:29:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	no disable that redhat repo
Jan 27 21:29:59 <Ben_1>	On the rpmfusion tutorial they say "sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia"
Jan 27 21:30:32 <Ben_1>	which produces this error: package akmod-nvidia-3:455.28-1.fc33.x86_64 requires nvidia-kmod-common >= 3:455.28, but none of the providers can be installed
Jan 27 21:30:42 <Ben_1>	mh
Jan 27 21:30:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	sudo dnf install kmod-nvidia --disablerepo=cuda-rhel8-x86_64
Jan 27 21:30:49 <Ben_1>	probably this is causing the issue: package nvidia-kmod-common-3:455.32.00-1.el8.noarch is filtered out by modular filtering
Jan 27 21:31:05 <Ben_1>	ok I will try
Jan 27 21:31:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	and you may have to remove all the el8 packages from your system
Jan 27 21:31:26 <Ben_1>	ok seems to work
Jan 27 21:31:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	rpm -qa |grep nvidia |fpaste
Jan 27 21:31:53 <Ben_1>	should I remove the rhel repo completely?
Jan 27 21:31:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes
Jan 27 21:32:30 <needmorehare>	Ben_1, there's a proper Fedora repo for it made by NVIDIA
Jan 27 21:32:42 <Ben_1>	ok thanks for your help, you saved me a lot of time
Jan 27 21:32:58 <Ben_1>	needmorehare: with the same packages as in rpmfusion?
Jan 27 21:33:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	needmorehare, dont confuse the situation please
Jan 27 21:33:28 *	needmorehare stays silent until the akmod situation is cleared up
Jan 27 21:33:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	Ben_1, read the rpmfusion howto for cuda
Jan 27 21:34:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	Ben_1, still waiting on the rpm -qa |grep nvidia |fpaste
Jan 27 21:35:28 <Ben_1>	I just want to reboot to check whether everything works. Afterwards I will remove the repo and the el8 packages
Jan 27 21:36:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	lets look at the command i gave you first
Jan 27 21:36:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	**shakes Head **
Jan 27 21:37:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	needmorehare, yeah we have dealt with these issues for years
Jan 27 21:38:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	even before rpmfusion existed
Jan 27 21:38:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	back in the livna days
Jan 27 21:51:59 <Ben_1>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/e47899f0
Jan 27 21:52:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	looks good
Jan 27 21:53:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	just remember that sometime when you get a new kernel you may have to reboot twice
Jan 27 21:53:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	first time the kmod builds but that is too late for the system to use it so you have to reboot a second time
Jan 27 21:55:07 <Ben_1>	good to know, thanks :)!

Jan 28 01:03:57 <dan01>	Ok, something very curious happened to me ^_^
Jan 28 01:04:40 <dan01>	I've just installed Fedora 33 out of the network install, and for my surprise, Netflix could play movies without having to install ffmpeg-libs from RpmFusioun
Jan 28 01:04:51 <dan01>	How come? :)
Jan 28 01:06:08 <gnafu>	dan01: I'm not sure of the specifics, but I /think/ Fedora ships with "legally safe" AAC and H.264 decoding these days.
Jan 28 01:06:24 <gnafu>	H.264 is provided by OpenH264.
Jan 28 01:06:33 <gnafu>	And let me see if I can find the article about AAC...
Jan 28 01:06:50 <dan01>	gnafu: Yes, but I always thought that only decodes some WebRTC profile, right?
Jan 28 01:06:53 <gnafu>	Here we go: libva-intel-hybrid-driver
Jan 28 01:07:03 <gnafu>	Oops: libva-intel-hybrid-driver
Jan 28 01:07:11 <gnafu>	Dangit!  Why won't that URL copy...
Jan 28 01:07:35 <dan01>	I mean don't get me wrong I don't know what I'm talking about I've just read that thing. Sure, please give the URL :)
Jan 28 01:07:38 <dan01>	Can't wait to read
Jan 28 01:08:36 <gnafu>	https://blogs.gnome.org/kalev/2019/09/25/out-of-box-h-264-and-aac-support-in-fedora-31-workstation/
Jan 28 01:09:16 <gnafu>	dan01: I think OpenH264 used to only be for WebRTC, but it seems it's now for systemwide H.264 decoding.
Jan 28 01:09:47 <dan01>	ah ok
Jan 28 01:10:07 <dan01>	anyways, this is a real spoil, if that's the correct Enghlish expression
Jan 28 01:10:15 <dan01>	I'm really happy about this, was a nice surprise :)
Jan 28 01:11:15 <NULL[m]2>	is it worth it switching from Ubuntu to Fedora?
Jan 28 01:11:21 <NULL[m]2>	 * is it worth it switching from (K)Ubuntu to Fedora?
Jan 28 01:11:55 <dan01>	NULL[m]2: Well, these are preferences and you're on the Fedora channel :))
Jan 28 01:11:55 <gnafu>	NULL[m]2: I think so, but that's in part because I haven't used Ubuntu in over 10 years ;-).
Jan 28 01:12:26 <dan01>	NULL[m]2: I like Fedora because it uses more upstream aka modern software. Including Wayland/Btrfs/Kernel
Jan 28 01:12:48 <chrisawi>	dan01: netflix uses vp9 by default anyway
Jan 28 01:12:54 <NULL[m]2>	I heard the battery life is better
Jan 28 01:13:08 <NULL[m]2>	but I rather like APT
Jan 28 01:13:13 <dan01>	chrisawi: I know back a couple of months ago, I've did this and I could not play Netflix by default
Jan 28 01:13:16 <gnafu>	chrisawi: Does it nowadays?  Last I heard, they only used VP9 for mobile downloads (watch offline).
Jan 28 01:14:26 <dan01>	But maybe you are right, not sure how to check? Any website that uses for sure H.264?
Jan 28 01:15:02 <chrisawi>	I just tried playing something in chrome and checked the debug info, and it seems to be using vp9 (but he-aac for audio)
Jan 28 01:15:29 <chrisawi>	(ctrl+alt+shift+D)
Jan 28 01:19:06 <dan01>	chrisawi: Any idea how to view that info in Firefox?
Jan 28 01:20:54 <chrisawi>	that's a netflix keybinding
Jan 28 01:21:36 <dan01>	yup, you're right it's vp9
Jan 28 01:30:58 <gnafu>	chrisawi: Awesome!
Jan 28 01:31:22 <gnafu>	I still think H.264 will work without ffmpeg-libs now, but I'm not sure.
Jan 28 01:34:49 <dan01>	how can I try it?
Jan 28 01:43:13 <gnafu>	dan01: You can try Vimeo.  Anything that's not a Staff Pick should use H.264 by default (and you can press "d" to see stats).
Jan 28 01:43:34 <gnafu>	(There Staff Picks use AV1 if your browser supports it.)
Jan 28 01:43:45 <gnafu>	s/There/Their/
Jan 28 01:43:54 <dan01>	gnafu: thanks
Jan 28 01:47:56 <dan01>	it says Codec:AVC / AAC
Jan 28 01:49:57 <dan01>	will it's working, it's kind of lagging
Jan 28 01:50:03 <dan01>	But hey! It's a progress!
Jan 28 01:51:33 <dowdle>	dan01: I don't think the codec support in the OpenH264 package is very comprehensive... so installing the rpmfusion stuff is recommended... if you want a wide range of compat.
Jan 28 01:51:54 <dan01>	thanks
Jan 28 01:52:09 <dan01>	Is Firefox on Fedora Firefox-Wayland?
Jan 28 01:52:12 <dowdle>	dan01: When hardware support for AV1 is widespread, hopefully most everything will shift to it.
Jan 28 01:52:13 *	CamBan69_ is now known as CamBan69
Jan 28 01:52:41 <dowdle>	dan01: firefox-wayland is just a shell script that runs the regular firefox with the wayland flag.
Jan 28 01:52:59 <dowdle>	dan01: You can look at it and see.
Jan 28 01:53:35 <dowdle>	dan01: cat /usr/bin/firefox-wayland
Jan 28 01:55:06 <dan01>	ah I see
Jan 28 01:56:12 <dan01>	But still the question remains, does firefox run with that MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 by default? How can I find that out?
Jan 28 01:57:13 <kk4ewt>	dan01 i thought there was a firefox-wayland package
Jan 28 01:57:24 <dan01>	kk4ewt: it is
Jan 28 01:57:59 <kk4ewt>	so i dont think standard firefox has that
Jan 28 01:58:13 <kk4ewt>	only if you add firefox-wayland
Jan 28 01:58:26 <dan01>	kk4ewt: I was wondering if there's any use to install it, if firefox runs by default with MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1, but then the package would be useless I guess
Jan 28 01:59:18 <kk4ewt>	i would have to look at the kickstart for workstation to see which is included
Jan 28 01:59:27 <kk4ewt>	or if both are
Jan 28 01:59:40 <kk4ewt>	i will check that when i am at work tomorrow
Jan 28 02:00:46 <dan01>	thanks for the help all, good night!

Jan 28 02:04:05 <dowdle>	kk4ewt: The firefox-wayland package is only a shell script that runs firefox with a WAYLAND option set... so the regular firefox binary (as Fedora packages it) does both X11 and Wayland.

Jan 28 02:40:35 <linuxmodder>	suavedandy, for some things yes but you need to have a reason the system doesnt naturally allow you to shoot yourself in the head and foot in the same instance for pete's sake
Jan 28 02:40:55 <linuxmodder>	if you need those for access mostly then add what you need and nothing more
Jan 28 02:41:16 <linuxmodder>	linuxmodder wheel cockpit transmission libvirt www-data
Jan 28 02:41:37 <linuxmodder>	those are my users groups and those are it and system works amazingly well
Jan 28 02:41:45 <linuxmodder>	and that WAS NOT out the box
Jan 28 02:43:29 <linuxmodder>	cockpit for some remote stuff transmission because of some things being in that group and libvirt and ww-data for VMs and webserver resepctively all other things are set with other access needs not requiring groups
Jan 28 02:44:51 <linuxmodder>	and I even do some android tweaking and you dont see anything for that, because its not needed if you use other means that are sane and safe liek udev

Feb 01 19:39:01 <coz_>	ok, F33 & f34, the 5.10.10 kernel on F33 works fine with the tribar plymouth theme. The 5.10.11 and above as F34 rc4 kernel, tribar fails by showing text, a bad quality video  ,   https://www.dropbox.com/s/g6yusrciahs1895/tribar.webm?dl=0  , first part is the 5.10.10 kernel, tribar working properly, the second part shows the bug
Feb 01 19:39:54 *	jesusjesse is now known as jessetree
Feb 01 19:44:50 <gnafu>	coz_: I know it's not the desired outcome, and I'm sorry I don't know how to help, but: the second one actually looks kinda cool ;-).
Feb 01 19:45:07 <gnafu>	Hopefully someone else can chime in with a more useful response.
Feb 01 19:45:19 <wl_>	coz_, yeah plymouth is broken for me too
Feb 01 19:45:27 <coz_>	gnafu, lol no it is very distracting, it should be without text
Feb 01 19:45:35 <coz_>	wl_, cool to hear thanks
Feb 01 19:45:56 <coz_>	all other themes including solar work fine
Feb 01 19:47:36 <coz_>	but I really like the tribar theme
Feb 01 19:47:49 <wl_>	since you already have a video of it, I'd suggesting filing a bug report that links to the video demonstration
Feb 01 19:48:18 <coz_>	wl_,  yeah , where I file that bug?
Feb 01 19:48:21 <wl_>	I think it affects all themes, and not just tribar
Feb 01 19:48:23 <wl_>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/
Feb 01 19:48:32 <coz_>	ah cool thanks wl_
Feb 01 19:53:40 <Xenorites>	Hello; could use some advice. I got a new GPU - switched from an nVidia to AMD; I have removed all the nvidia diver packages, and have installed the xorg-x11-drv-amdgpu package. However, for some reason, when I try to log in (to the console, no DM installed) I am immediately logged back out now.
Feb 01 19:54:52 <quippy>	hi I was wondering if anybody knew how to get a application icon to display in the dock when you manually create a .desktop file to install an app? It shows up in the Gnome Overlay / Activities pane, but not the dock on the left hand side for some reason
Feb 01 19:55:32 <Xenorites>	I did the package uninstall/reinstall from a chroot, since graphical console completely froze on boot with the GPU installed initially
Feb 01 19:56:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	Xenorites, google dracut
Feb 01 19:56:37 <Xenorites>	quippy: you need to add applications to the dock yourself; it's not done automatically
Feb 01 19:56:58 <quippy>	oh no sorry, I mean that when it is added, the icon image is not displayed
Feb 01 19:57:17 <quippy>	but the image is displayed normally in the Activities overview
Feb 01 19:57:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	Xenorites, a) does the machine boot with a live (updated fedora live )
Feb 01 19:57:46 <Xenorites>	Southern_Gentlem: I'm not having problems booting; and I have run Dracut already. current problem is that when I log in, i am immediatly logged out
Feb 01 19:58:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	what DM
Feb 01 19:58:31 <Xenorites>	i.e. with a successful login, it immediately takes me back to the login screen
Feb 01 19:58:42 <Xenorites>	as mentioned, no dm installed
Feb 01 19:59:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	try a new user
Feb 01 19:59:52 <Southern_Gentlem>	single mode create new user
Feb 01 19:59:54 <_AnK>	That behavior typical for /home/user not mounted properly. You can check that from tty2 login and lsblk
Feb 01 20:00:26 *	tmsmr1 is now known as tmsmr
Feb 01 20:04:34 <Xenorites>	already tried with root, and still the same problem
Feb 01 20:04:53 <Xenorites>	neither root nor home have seperate volumes in my installation
Feb 01 20:06:22 <Xenorites>	quippy: perhaps it's an image size/resolution issue?
Feb 01 20:07:24 <faern>	I'm running Fedora 33 workstation on an Intel NUC as a media PC. A problem I'm having is that it stops responding to network requests a short while after I turn off the monitor it's connected to. How can I stop it from doing that?
Feb 01 20:07:36 <faern>	I have masked the sleep.target hibernate.target and most others.
Feb 01 20:07:52 <faern>	And I have tried running a constant systemd-inhibit invocation in a tmux shell.
Feb 01 20:08:16 <Xenorites>	faern: Fedora does not sleep natively
Feb 01 20:08:21 <faern>	And according to the power LED it's still on. But shortly after turning off the monitor it stops allowing SSH and other network requests.
Feb 01 20:08:28 <Xenorites>	have you configured the firewall correctly?
Feb 01 20:08:31 <faern>	It also does not react to keyboard presses.
Feb 01 20:08:43 <faern>	The keyboard does nothing until I turn the monitor back on.
Feb 01 20:09:03 <Xenorites>	which NUC is this?
Feb 01 20:09:11 <faern>	Xenorites: It lets me in over ssh and is reachable over other protocols while the monitor is on. So I don't think it's the firewall.
Feb 01 20:09:11 <Xenorites>	it sounds like some kind of hardware sleep, or something
Feb 01 20:09:44 <faern>	It's the NUC8i3BEH2
Feb 01 20:10:33 <faern>	Maybe I should check out the UEFI and see if there is any setting there.
Feb 01 20:11:32 <Xenorites>	yeah, see if there is some kind of power-saving enabled
Feb 01 20:11:50 <Xenorites>	the behavior you are describing is strange
Feb 01 20:12:04 <quippy>	yeah it could be Xenorites , that's an idea
Feb 01 20:12:55 *	tmsmr1 is now known as tmsmr
Feb 01 20:13:48 <quippy>	the .desktop specification doesn't seem to indicate any restrictions on the type of file specified
Feb 01 20:20:39 <faern>	Xenorites: I tried disabling DHMI CEC. Let's see if that does something.
Feb 01 20:22:29 <faern>	HDMI*

Feb 01 20:45:14 *	gurmble is now known as grumble
Feb 01 20:58:19 <cmurf>	faern: you're not using powertop by any chance are you? with autotune?
Feb 01 20:58:48 <cmurf>	because on my older NUC that powers down USB and it doesn't ever come back up until i reboot, and thus i lose the keyboard
Feb 01 20:59:20 <cmurf>	granted, i've applied 1/2 dozen UEFI firmware updates for that NUC since I last tested USB and powertop stuff
Feb 01 21:01:45 <faern>	cmurf: Nope. Nothing like that. A fairly standard install of ff33 workstation and not much done to it.
Feb 01 21:02:54 <cmurf>	Xenorites: Fedora 33 defaults to Btrfs, where / is on a subvolume named 'root' and /home is on a subvolume named "home"
Feb 01 21:03:23 <faern>	So far the problem of not being able to SSH into it went away after disabling CEC. But the wireless keyboard is still dead.
Feb 01 21:03:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	cmurf, no on upgrades or server
Feb 01 21:03:37 <cmurf>	oh it's an upgrade sorry
Feb 01 21:03:38 *	tmsmr1 is now known as tmsmr
Feb 01 21:03:56 <cmurf>	ahh yeah Server is XFS without a separate LV for /home
Feb 01 21:04:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	but it should hae /root
Feb 01 21:04:19 <cmurf>	there's reserved space in the VG that's intentionally not allocated at install time
Feb 01 21:04:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	have
Feb 01 21:04:55 <cmurf>	yeah if /root - as in the home for root user - is MIA then something unintended happened (user error)
Feb 01 21:05:19 <cmurf>	faern: what is CEC?
Feb 01 21:05:54 <cmurf>	wireless keyboard means bluetooth so it sounds like bluetooth is dropping the keyboard for some reason - that's harder to troubleshoot
Feb 01 21:06:57 <cmurf>	i've got an apple bluetooth mouse that's super flakey on linux, it just vanishes randomly no matter what laptop it's paired with, and then comes back
Feb 01 21:06:59 <cmurf>	but that's not your problem because, the keyboard isn't coming back
Feb 01 21:07:22 <cmurf>	it sounds power save related though
Feb 01 21:13:36 <faern>	cmurf: https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-cec-4158343
Feb 01 21:14:23 <faern>	cmurf: It's not bt. It has it's own receiver. So the wireless protocol itself is probably irrelevant. It's how the receiver is probably put idle or something.
Feb 01 21:15:58 <cmurf>	ahh

Feb 01 21:29:50 <rorizz[m]>	who came up with this weird restriction
Feb 01 21:30:10 <rorizz[m]>	i do this all the time on windows and it saves me a lot of time
Feb 01 21:31:22 <happymeal>	windows just doesnt throw the error
Feb 01 21:31:31 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: So you are dragging and dropping a file on top of itself?  For what purpose?
Feb 01 21:31:32 <happymeal>	i dont think its actually doing what you think
Feb 01 21:31:42 <happymeal>	cuz, why would you be doing that lol
Feb 01 21:32:01 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: What is it you are trying to do?  rename a file?
Feb 01 21:33:16 <rorizz[m]>	i have a folder named abc, inside that there's a folder named abc, and inside that there's a file. i don't want the two "abc" folders so i cut the one that has the file and then paste it on the other
Feb 01 21:35:57 <Xenorites>	sorry, stepped away. cmurf I did a manual partitioning and install; I'm using LVM with XFS as the filesystem. /var and /boot are the only separate volumes from / - no DM, was using i3, am planning to move to Sway once I can log in again...
Feb 01 21:36:09 <faern>	I take back what I said about disabling HDMI CEC solving the issue. It just took a bit longer. Now it does not respond over network either.
Feb 01 21:36:35 <Xenorites>	faern: is this machine wired or wireless?
Feb 01 21:36:41 <faern>	Wireless
Feb 01 21:36:49 *	rorizz[m] uploaded an image: abc abc file.png (35KiB) < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/DmsquRnGnxqfkteZHVGWuNWT/abc abc file.png >
Feb 01 21:36:50 <rorizz[m]>	the folder above this one is empty (except for the folder that has the same name)
Feb 01 21:37:58 <faern>	I have been planning on wiring it up. Maybe it's time to do that :/
Feb 01 21:38:11 <Xenorites>	I think wired is the way to go
Feb 01 21:38:28 <rorizz[m]>	cutting this folder and pasting it in "abcdef" is an effective way of removing one folder layer
Feb 01 21:38:30 <rorizz[m]>	and it works in windows
Feb 01 21:38:32 <faern>	But it does not explain the keyboard being unusable.
Feb 01 21:39:46 <faern>	And wiring up the network is just a workaround. It must be possible to make it stay awake on a wifi as well :/
Feb 01 21:40:56 <coke>	rorizz[m]: sounds like you want to use windows? if you want to use linux make script that does it?
Feb 01 21:41:11 <rorizz[m]>	why?
Feb 01 21:42:58 <rorizz[m]>	so let's cripple everything on purpose just so we can say "use windows instead"?
Feb 01 21:43:07 <coke>	linux is historically serious about directories
Feb 01 21:43:27 <rorizz[m]>	wdym?
Feb 01 21:44:17 <coke>	your question is why is my blue car not red .. and there is no answer to that question
Feb 01 21:45:25 <rorizz[m]>	i'm asking why a very useful thing is restricted when there is no reason to restrict it
Feb 01 21:45:47 <rorizz[m]>	i have to spend extra time working around it for no reason
Feb 01 21:46:12 <Xenorites>	restricted?
Feb 01 21:46:17 <coke>	so ask the developer of the tool you are using
Feb 01 21:46:22 <coke>	no he's not in this channel
Feb 01 21:46:43 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: Don't do it that way and no problem.  Just rename the top level dir and you can drag.
Feb 01 21:46:46 <rorizz[m]>	idk who that is
Feb 01 21:47:00 <Xenorites>	you are asking to do an odd operation that can be accomplished a dozen different ways that the one you implemented.
Feb 01 21:47:21 <coke>	or you could just write a script that does what you want and learn something useful ..
Feb 01 21:47:26 <Xenorites>	the help > about menu will tell you the name of the software, and perhaps the tree you actually want to be barking up...
Feb 01 21:47:34 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: Or just move the files from the parent dir to the grand parent dir and delete the parent dir when done.
Feb 01 21:48:34 <rorizz[m]>	which can take a lot more time depending on what i'm cutting/pasting
Feb 01 21:49:07 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: Your "way" assumes a certain understanding of what it is you are trying to do... but what if someone who did what you did, didn't want that to happen?
Feb 01 21:51:03 <rorizz[m]>	if that user doesn't want to cut and paste like that, he doesn't have to?
Feb 01 21:53:17 <coke>	what your paste does is change the parent of the file and then delete the empty leaf directory
Feb 01 21:53:17 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: Such an operation is often done by mistake.
Feb 01 21:53:35 <coke>	deleting something is not the obvious choice when you paste
Feb 01 21:53:43 <dowdle>	ZACKLY
Feb 01 21:55:00 <rorizz[m]>	oh ok
Feb 01 21:55:12 <coke>	just because you dont see the downsides or they dont matter to you doesn't mean they dont exist
Feb 01 21:56:28 <rorizz[m]>	well it took all this time to mention downsides
Feb 01 21:56:42 <rorizz[m]>	also i clicked About -> Credits and it lists around 40 people. pinning down and contacting who made this specific decision would be pretty difficult
Feb 01 22:00:29 <coke>	21:43:09 <coke> linux is historically serious about directories
Feb 01 22:00:38 <coke>	nautillus doesnt break with that tradition
Feb 01 22:01:12 <coke>	if you want to move one directory tree over another one you have to use special tools cause mv just doesnt do it
Feb 01 22:03:09 <rorizz[m]>	oh ok
Feb 01 22:03:28 <rorizz[m]>	are there any gui tools that do it?
Feb 01 22:24:17 <dowdle>	rorizz[m]: Not that I know of.... but there are a bunch of file managers to pick from.  I'd be surprised if anyone implemented that as doing so is assuming a whole lot and not a "restriction".

Feb 03 10:59:35 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: package providing that seems to be libnfsidmap
Feb 03 10:59:37 <ncuxo>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Renich/HowTo/NFSv4
Feb 03 11:00:37 <ncuxo>	dnf provides haven't given any results by me :/
Feb 03 11:00:59 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: for what?
Feb 03 11:01:58 <[Enrico]>	dnf whatprovides /etc/idmapd.conf works for me, it returns the package name
Feb 03 11:01:59 <ncuxo>	for '*idmapd*'
Feb 03 11:02:08 <ncuxo>	oh
Feb 03 11:02:18 <ncuxo>	didn't knew the whatprovides option
Feb 03 11:02:19 <ncuxo>	thanks
Feb 03 11:02:46 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: rpc.idmapd is provided by nfs-utils
Feb 03 11:03:06 <ncuxo>	yeap found it
Feb 03 11:03:20 <ncuxo>	okay but my rpcbind.service and socker are masked
Feb 03 11:03:37 <[Enrico]>	unmask them
Feb 03 11:03:55 <ncuxo>	red hat documentation tells you that nfs4 doesn't need them
Feb 03 11:04:12 <ncuxo>	so there have to be something fishy here
Feb 03 11:04:25 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: if they are not needed they should not start
Feb 03 11:05:27 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: nfs-server.service wants rpcbind.socket . You mask it, you break it
Feb 03 11:05:48 <[Enrico]>	might be needed only for nfsv3 of course
Feb 03 11:06:05 <[Enrico]>	start without masking, have it working, once you have it working, start masking stuff, reboot and test
Feb 03 11:06:45 <ncuxo>	# systemctl mask --now rpc-statd.service rpcbind.service rpcbind.socket

Feb 03 11:14:15 <ncuxo>	tbh first time having problem following rhel tutorial on fedora
Feb 03 11:15:00 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: they are not supposed to work on Fedora. If they do it's a fluke
Feb 03 11:16:42 <[Enrico]>	Fedora is much newer software and it's an independent project. While they share a lot, they are not strictly related. But if there is no major change in the software involved, then yes they would probably work
Feb 03 11:38:31 <ncuxo>	okay following this guide unmasked all the services and still permission error https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Renich/HowTo/NFSv4
Feb 03 11:43:00 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: give this a try: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/438939/how-to-get-nfsv4-idmap-working-with-sec-sys/464950#464950
Feb 03 11:43:10 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: maybe simply clearing the cache with nfsidmap -c might make it work
Feb 03 11:45:03 <[Enrico]>	now if you don't need idmapping, you can keep it disabled of course
Feb 03 11:45:41 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: also: ACLs do not work with NFSv4, I forgot to mention that
Feb 03 11:45:54 <[Enrico]>	if you want POSIX ACL support, use NFSv3
Feb 03 11:56:34 <ncuxo>	the most important comment from the above post: "Just to add an important point, after all of the above setup with sec=sys, ID mapping works only while reading files. Writing/modifying is governed by simple UNIX DAC because RPC mechanism knows nothing about mapping. ID mapping works fully only with Kerberos. serverfault.com/a/812829/452872 – Irfan Latif"
Feb 03 11:56:53 <ncuxo>	so yeah without ldap it doesn't work
Feb 03 11:57:12 <ncuxo>	I'll have to have a special user
Feb 03 12:01:07 <ncuxo>	however thank you [Enrico] for the time
Feb 03 12:01:15 <ncuxo>	quess I need to setup ldap first
Feb 03 12:02:02 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: I would totally recommend against that
Feb 03 12:02:07 <[Enrico]>	it's a pain in the neck
Feb 03 12:02:19 <[Enrico]>	and the benefits are insignificant
Feb 03 12:02:25 <[Enrico]>	just use NFSv3
Feb 03 12:02:42 <[Enrico]>	or figure out how to completely disable idmapping
Feb 03 12:03:03 <ncuxo>	idmapping was disabled on both server and client
Feb 03 12:03:08 <ncuxo>	and I enabled it
Feb 03 12:03:13 <ncuxo>	but it still don't work
Feb 03 12:03:30 <[Enrico]>	ncuxo: nsswitch.conf might also be involved. Not sure
Feb 03 12:05:39 <ncuxo>	what is the purpose of having nfsv4 if everyone will continue to use nfsv3 and advice against using nfsv4
Feb 03 12:05:57 <ncuxo>	I just wanna figure out how the damn think works document it and be done with it
Feb 03 12:06:10 <ncuxo>	s/think/thing
Feb 03 12:07:14 <[Enrico]>	nfsv4 is designed to integrate with kerberos and has its own system of ACLs (NVFSv4ACLs which nobody supports). It's been a total disaster from the design point of view, a massive failure and the world would be a better place without it to be honest :)
Feb 03 12:07:41 <[Enrico]>	I assume in theory it was done to integrate better with Windows systems.... but now Windows dropped NFS support anyway
Feb 03 12:08:01 <[Enrico]>	as far as Linux is concerned NFSv4 is useless
Feb 03 12:08:05 <[Enrico]>	in my humble opinion
Feb 03 12:08:51 <[Enrico]>	for me the fact that it doesn't support POSIX ACLs alone is just a major blocker
Feb 03 12:38:09 <yogoyo>	i am sitting in front of xfce's neat notification log, with an info ballon from dnfdragora, but the notify log is empty. what do i need to do so the log includes such notifies?

Feb 03 13:15:51 <bendem>	Files supports dark theme just fine
Feb 03 13:16:30 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Wait where can i change the setting？
Feb 03 13:16:49 <bendem>	Tweaks > Appearance > Applications > Adwaita-dark
Feb 03 13:17:27 <bendem>	you have to install Tweaks though, not sure why it's not installed by default with gnome since it's the one way to configure gnome
Feb 03 13:18:36 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Oh ok so i need to install that.thanks. i will check it out then come back if have problem.

Feb 03 22:02:19 <Bluesboy[m]>	Hey, folks! Is there a Desktop Matrix client for Fedora?
Feb 03 22:07:17 <Khaytsus>	Bluesboy[m]: element is in flatpak
Feb 03 22:07:35 <Khaytsus>	I just use the website, it's not that different
Feb 03 22:11:21 <kellya[m]>	Yeah.  I just use element too.  I tried Fractal (because gnome), but I don't think it does e2ee
Feb 03 22:13:02 <Bluesboy[m]>	<Khaytsus "I just use the website, it's not"> It's not that convinient IMO
Feb 03 22:14:31 <Gestra>	looks like there's at least neochat, nheko, quaternion and spectral in the fedora repos if you don't want to use Element from flathub
Feb 03 22:15:07 <dowdle>	I think nirik wrote up a blog post a couple of months ago comparing and contrasting the various matrix clients he had tried.
Feb 03 22:15:16 *	dowdle uses an IRC client.
Feb 03 22:17:14 <dowdle>	Here's that blog post: https://www.scrye.com/wordpress/nirik/2020/11/28/matrix-and-fedora/

Feb 03 22:27:14 <arethuza>	I have a 2 monitor setup with gnome wayland on fedora 33 and it doesnt turn off my monitors when I lock the screen. It'll turn off for a second but then the monitor will turn back on. Anyone know how to fix this issue? I saw a bunch of open DPMS bugs.
Feb 03 22:28:35 <Dustin[m]>	<arethuza "I have a 2 monitor setup with gn"> Oh, that's an interesting problem. I am currently on Fedora 33 with a USB-C dock attached to a monitor and it does disable the screen normally
Feb 03 22:29:32 <arethuza>	is there a setting or something that I should check?
Feb 03 22:29:47 <janos_>	please, if using matrix - don't quote. it junks up irc which this channel is natively
Feb 03 22:37:40 <cmurf>	git bisect weirdness, I'm confused, any ideas?
Feb 03 22:37:42 <cmurf>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b692fa5e
Feb 03 22:39:53 <Dustin[m]>	<janos_ "please, if using matrix - don't "> Gotcha. Is that something that can be tweaked with the bridge?
Feb 03 22:40:14 <Dustin[m]>	janos_: Gotcha. Is that something you can fix in the IRC bridge?
Feb 03 22:40:38 <janos_>	no idea. i use irc clients when in irc
Feb 03 22:41:32 <janos_>	i'm not familiar with the architecture, but a bridge seems like an odd place to address that sort of thing. i'd think the client knows it's connecting to a bridge and it adjusts its behavior and options to suit
Feb 03 22:43:05 <Dustin[m]>	It's a shame the people still using IRC will get a bunch of junk in their feeds when the Matrix users are just using their clients in an expected manner
Feb 03 22:43:15 <Dustin[m]>	These bridges are a bit messy
Feb 03 22:44:06 <janos_>	yeah. i wouldn't care what people used if they were the only ones to deal with their choices :)
Feb 03 22:48:25 <cmurf>	things will be different when Fedora moves natively to matrix, but I'm not sure about the time frame for that
Feb 03 22:50:41 <janos_>	when? it's been determined as a definite?
Feb 03 22:50:57 <Dustin[m]>	I was an avid IRC user for many, many years but I definitely prefer Matrix now
Feb 03 22:51:52 <janos_>	i mostly want something out of my way and that i can make very information-dense and compact
Feb 03 22:52:58 <cberg>	I like IRC mostly because I like the kind of people who are "still using IRC"
Feb 03 22:57:19 <Dustin[m]>	There are some very IRC-like clients for Matrix now as well as integration with emacs and so on
Feb 03 22:58:17 <cmurf>	janos_: yeah pretty sure it was talked about on devel@ list

Feb 03 23:40:34 <avu>	ok boomer
Feb 03 23:40:37 <dowdle>	You can say, "Ok, Boomer" to me if you want.
Feb 03 23:40:41 <janos_>	haha
Feb 03 23:40:48 <janos_>	would actually be one if not x/y/z!
Feb 03 23:41:41 <dowdle>	"boomers were born between 1946 and 1964".  I was born in 64.
Feb 03 23:41:48 <linuxmodder>	I'm technically a millienal but I hate everything about my generation especially crap like this
Feb 03 23:41:53 <Dustin[m]>	linuxmodder I'm not sure if it's reinventing the wheel as much as creating another wheel which can meet different needs
Feb 03 23:42:11 <janos_>	dowdle: boom
Feb 03 23:42:13 <janos_>	:P
Feb 03 23:42:30 <linuxmodder>	Dustin[m], what needs? some youngster that can text and snapchat but not setup a simple irc account on their phone ?
Feb 03 23:42:39 <janos_>	i think it's those needs which are contentious
Feb 03 23:42:48 <linuxmodder>	^^
Feb 03 23:43:11 <linuxmodder>	in too may cases these youngsters feel they need to reinvent their own space or tool to b relevant
Feb 03 23:43:15 <linuxmodder>	and that pisses me off
Feb 03 23:43:33 <dowdle>	And it MUST have a dark theme.
Feb 03 23:43:35 <dowdle>	:)
Feb 03 23:43:41 <dowdle>	With pastel icons.
Feb 03 23:43:45 <fmlatghor>	aw I missed the convo
Feb 03 23:43:52 <fmlatghor>	what are you guys talking about specfically?
Feb 03 23:43:55 <janos_>	pastel is one step too far!
Feb 03 23:43:58 <linuxmodder>	dowdle, I'm with you on dark theme tho
Feb 03 23:43:58 *	janos_ throws down
Feb 03 23:43:59 <Dustin[m]>	linuxmodder what would you say about Slack in comparison?
Feb 03 23:44:16 <zcanrpm[m]>	.
Feb 03 23:44:22 <janos_>	slack? i use it for work. bloated
Feb 03 23:44:23 <janos_>	closed
Feb 03 23:44:36 <janos_>	functional enough, but the bloat... my lord
Feb 03 23:44:48 <linuxmodder>	Dustin[m],  beyond its resource issues (electron in general sucks your resources) slack would be better IF it really had a spot to fill which I personally feel it doesnt
Feb 03 23:44:52 <zcanrpm[m]>	+ it's proprietary
Feb 03 23:45:08 <linuxmodder>	and I prefer like most here something open sourced
Feb 03 23:45:10 <linuxmodder>	Dustin[m], ^
Feb 03 23:45:31 <Dustin[m]>	So Matrix fulfils the needs of Slack but without being closed
Feb 03 23:45:44 <linuxmodder>	Dustin[m], not really
Feb 03 23:45:46 <fmlatghor>	there's also mattermost and other stuff
Feb 03 23:45:51 <Dustin[m]>	Which is why it is the platform of choice for various entities and government agencies in Europe now
Feb 03 23:45:55 <janos_>	but what are those needs
Feb 03 23:45:58 <Dustin[m]>	And continuing to gain ground in that regard
Feb 03 23:46:15 <linuxmodder>	matrix and its precursor riot are just hipster tools to make folks feel relevant they dont do irc any better than irc does

Feb 03 23:46:50 <linuxmodder>	with which demographic?  youngsters those under 30
Feb 03 23:46:54 <fmlatghor>	well, I love IRC, but having to be online all the time or use a bouncer is knda...
Feb 03 23:47:08 <fmlatghor>	that's enough to use xmpp instead for me
Feb 03 23:47:20 <linuxmodder>	fmlatghor,  use your phone its always online right?
Feb 03 23:47:49 <fmlatghor>	linuxmodder: I used to use my server, but I had an issue with it, and now I'm waiting for something
Feb 03 23:47:56 <linuxmodder>	mattermost is even more of a waste imo
Feb 03 23:48:08 <fmlatghor>	I'm just saying for most people

Feb 03 23:48:20 <fmlatghor>	like you can't expect everyone to use something like irc cloud or a bouncer
Feb 03 23:49:02 <linuxmodder>	same vien cant expect us all to embrace a new hipster app for the largely younger lazy crowd
Feb 03 23:49:03 <fmlatghor>	damn 8gb memory use
Feb 03 23:49:11 <linuxmodder>	for what?
Feb 03 23:49:12 <farribeiro[m]>	or... #fosdem-fedora-stand
Feb 03 23:49:29 <fmlatghor>	too many webapps probably
Feb 03 23:49:39 <fmlatghor>	I swear this happens everday
Feb 03 23:49:57 <fmlatghor>	I start gnome, it's all fine and fast, then I look at it later then it's slower and over 8gb ram uses
Feb 03 23:49:59 <fmlatghor>	*use
Feb 03 23:50:08 <zcanrpm[m]>	what

Feb 03 23:50:16 <fmlatghor>	yea
Feb 03 23:50:19 <zcanrpm[m]>	~750mb for me
Feb 03 23:50:25 <linuxmodder>	gnome is anotehr resource hog
Feb 03 23:50:36 <fmlatghor>	linuxmodder: trust me, it's not gnome
Feb 03 23:50:41 <linuxmodder>	but this bordering -social land now
Feb 03 23:50:55 <linuxmodder>	electron apps then ?
Feb 03 23:50:55 *	janos_ went quiet for that reason :)
Feb 03 23:51:32 <linuxmodder>	moving this to -social
Feb 03 23:51:48 <fmlatghor>	well whenever my computer freezes it's because I'm writing a lot of data to the hard drive, and I think you're right it is webapps, not all electron probably.
Feb 03 23:52:03 <Dustin[m]>	linuxmodder: Matrix has the advantage of offering a collaboration platform which free, open source and can be deployed and used by entities for digital sovereignty
Feb 03 23:52:13 <Dustin[m]>	Which is why it's used by the Bundeswehr, for example
Feb 03 23:52:23 <Dustin[m]>	And other government agencies in Europe
Feb 03 23:52:37 <linuxmodder>	Dustin[m], lets take this to social where it belongs now
Feb 03 23:52:42 <farribeiro[m]>	Maybe the fedora project
Feb 03 23:52:55 <Dustin[m]>	We can get back on topic now
Feb 03 23:54:14 <zcanrpm[m]>	which matrix client do you guys use?
Feb 03 23:54:24 <mutk_>	If it were not discussed here I'd have not known about it  :)
Feb 03 23:54:29 <farribeiro[m]>	Fluffychat in Android

Feb 03 23:54:46 <Dustin[m]>	I am using Element at the moment
Feb 03 23:54:56 <zcanrpm[m]>	element's a bloated mess
Feb 03 23:54:59 <Dustin[m]>	I was also playing around with Nheko and Fractal on Linux
Feb 03 23:55:01 <linuxmodder>	mutk_,  fair enough but mention and divert to appriorate channel

Feb 03 23:55:09 <Dustin[m]>	Nheko is quite lightweight
Feb 03 23:55:30 <fmlatghor>	Fractal would be good if it actually worked

Feb 03 23:56:18 <Dustin[m]>	Yeah, Fractal is implementing E2EE but it's not available yet
Feb 03 23:56:20 <fmlatghor>	used to use element, but there's a script for my irc client that seems to be beter
Feb 03 23:56:36 <fmlatghor>	for my use

Feb 03 23:56:49 <zcanrpm[m]>	it's fine

Feb 04 12:25:46 <nh-nh[m]>	Hello, I'd like to report a kind of bug (I guess) on fedora-workstation 33 in conjunction with keepassxc: the issue is already being discussed there: https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/5608 . In short, the search field in keepassxc doesn't take any typing input unless keppasxc is started through the terminal with "keepassxc -plateform wayland". The problem is ongoing since about October 2020. For me the
Feb 04 12:25:46 <nh-nh[m]>	problem disappeared after the updates including the new kernel 5.10.11 until today's update including keepassxc V2.6.4. According to the discussions in the link above, it seems to be a Wayland and or Qt issue. Are you already aware of the bug? Can you do something about it? Should I report elsewhere? Thanks in advance for your help! 😀
Feb 04 12:28:34 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: what Fedora package is this from? keepassx?
Feb 04 12:28:38 *	FranciscoD isn't using it
Feb 04 12:29:02 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "nh-nh: what Fedora package is th"> no: keepassxc
Feb 04 12:29:31 <FranciscoD>	right, I don't see a bug here on the tracker, so perhaps best to file one: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=keepassxc&list_id=11666683&product=Fedora&product=Fedora%20EPEL
Feb 04 12:30:12 <FranciscoD>	if you can also link to the upstream issue, the maintainer will be able to diagnose the issue and re-assign it to the right component
Feb 04 12:32:24 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: since it's gnome on wayland, it is possibly a qt5-wayland or maybe a qgnomeplatform issue
Feb 04 12:32:31 <FranciscoD>	try uninstalling that to see if it helps?
Feb 04 12:33:00 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: https://github.com/FedoraQt/QGnomePlatform + https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qgnomeplatform
Feb 04 12:33:15 <FranciscoD>	if removing this package fixes it, the bug will go to qgnomeplatform
Feb 04 12:33:26 <FranciscoD>	(there's been one or two bugs there with qt apps already)
Feb 04 12:39:15 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "try uninstalling that to see if "> Thanks for your Answers FransicoD. Do you mean uninstalling qt5-wayland, qgnomeplatform or keepassxc?
Feb 04 12:39:33 <FranciscoD>	I'd start with qgnomeplatform
Feb 04 12:39:56 <FranciscoD>	qt5-wayland is a core package, so that's probably a compulsory dependency
Feb 04 12:40:05 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "I'd start with qgnomeplatform"> Isn't it going to break other things?
Feb 04 12:40:25 <FranciscoD>	no, it's just a theme to ensure that Qt apps on Gnome look like native GTK gnome apps
Feb 04 12:40:42 <FranciscoD>	your QT apps will just look more QT like without it on Gnome
Feb 04 12:40:43 <nh-nh[m]>	Ok, I try
Feb 04 12:41:00 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: but do check the transaction list: hopefully it won't try to uninstall lots of other gnome things
Feb 04 12:44:41 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "nh-nh: but do check the transact"> It wants to also remove dependency qt5-qtwayland, is it still safe to do?
Feb 04 12:44:52 <FranciscoD>	hrm, we can work around that
Feb 04 12:44:54 <FranciscoD>	try:
Feb 04 12:45:00 <FranciscoD>	sudo dnf shell
Feb 04 12:45:04 <FranciscoD>	when you get the shell, do:
Feb 04 12:45:10 <FranciscoD>	remove qgnomeplatform
Feb 04 12:45:17 <FranciscoD>	install qt5-qtwayland
Feb 04 12:45:23 <FranciscoD>	resolvedep
Feb 04 12:45:57 <FranciscoD>	ts
Feb 04 12:45:58 <FranciscoD>	run
Feb 04 12:46:06 <FranciscoD>	(it should only include the removal of qgnomeplatform in the transaction on the `ts` step)
Feb 04 12:47:27 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "hrm, we can work around that"> Most excellent! Just learned something new! Thanks a lot!
Feb 04 12:47:40 <nh-nh[m]>	Let see if it changed anything
Feb 04 12:48:19 <nh-nh[m]>	I just restart and be back.
Feb 04 12:51:41 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "if removing this package fixes i"> OK, so my keepassxc isn't in darkmode anymore, but the bug is still present: I guess it means qgnomplatform can be ruled out as source of the problem.
Feb 04 12:51:56 <FranciscoD>	uh, yeh
Feb 04 12:52:00 <FranciscoD>	I was hoping that'd be it XD
Feb 04 12:52:18 <FranciscoD>	I guess qt5-wayland is next on the candidate list, but I don't know where to start debugging that
Feb 04 12:52:37 <FranciscoD>	if dnf said it was unused when you tried to remove qgnomeplatform, perhaps uninstalling it to try is next?
Feb 04 12:56:49 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "if dnf said it was unused when y"> Is there a risk of crashing gnome with that? I'll try it, but if it crashes the whole system I don't think I'll be able to get it back up. If your sure I'll still be able to reinstall qt5-qtwayland even if uninstalling it produced minor bugs I could give it a try..
Feb 04 12:57:20 <FranciscoD>	It shouldnt crash gnome---it's only needed for qt apps
Feb 04 12:57:50 <nh-nh[m]>	OK, so wost case some apps won't open until I reinstall it?
Feb 04 12:58:15 <FranciscoD>	Yeh
Feb 04 12:58:19 <laolux[m]>	If you do dnf remove something, then it will show you all dependent packages to also be removed. So, if it shows gnome, then better stop the transaction.
Feb 04 12:58:48 <nh-nh[m]>	Ok, I give it a try
Feb 04 12:59:58 <FranciscoD>	🤞
Feb 04 13:00:12 <nh-nh[m]>	OK, gone. I restart and be back
Feb 04 13:04:10 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "🤞"> Tadaa! It solves the problem! 🤗 So, if I undestand correctly: the bug is within package qt5-qtwayland and therefore should be reported where?
Feb 04 13:04:25 <FranciscoD>	ah, hrm
Feb 04 13:05:00 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&classification=Fedora&component=qt5-qtwayland&list_id=11666771&product=Fedora&product=Fedora%20EPEL
Feb 04 13:05:08 <FranciscoD>	you can login to bugzilla with your FAS account
Feb 04 13:07:02 <nh-nh[m]>	<FranciscoD "nh-nh: here: https://bugzilla.re"> OK, I'll do that. Many Thanks for all the help and have a very nice day!
Feb 04 13:12:35 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: you too.
Feb 04 13:12:59 <Strongstan>	can anyone ping e14966.dsca.akamaiedge.net
Feb 04 13:13:24 <FranciscoD>	nh-nh[m]: This doesn't necessarily mean that the bug is in this particular piece of code, but at least it's a starting point

Feb 07 15:14:31 <foomf>	I let the anaconda installer use the default settings when setting up partitions. They're all really tiny though, my / directly is only 15gb in size. My drive is 240gb, but none of the other filesystems in the df command seem to indicate where all of that went. parted shows there's a /dev/sda3 partition that's 222gb big (I guess that's where it all went), but it's mount point is "fedora_fedora" and doesn't show up in df. How do I get access to this storage
Feb 07 15:14:31 <foomf>	space?
Feb 07 15:18:43 <MichaelP>	Hows come in 1 distro only gives my monitor a refresh rate of 30 hz at 3840x2160 but in fedora i get the full 60 hz ?

Feb 07 16:24:17 <ledeni>	foomf➡ try to install 'epiphany'
Feb 07 16:31:19 <foomf>	ledeni: found it, thanks!
Feb 07 16:38:11 <bmbouter>	linuxmodder: apologies I left but I back. it's fedora 32. it's an upgrade from F31 (and many before that). I've uninstalled and reinstalled vlc rpm a few times
Feb 07 16:39:13 <bmbouter>	I see this logging output when I try to launch the vlc icon https://paste.centos.org/view/654e3087
Feb 07 17:02:45 <ledeni>	bmbouter: try to run vlc from term just to see it is lanch that way
Feb 07 17:03:04 <Khaytsus>	Is this still going on?  Wow.
Feb 07 17:04:14 <ledeni>	bmbouter:*lunch
Feb 07 17:09:50 <ledeni>	bmbouter➡ can you give us 'cat /usr/share/applications/vlc.desktop | fpaste'
Feb 07 17:24:38 <bmbouter>	yes I can launch nicely from term
Feb 07 17:25:25 <bmbouter>	https://paste.centos.org/view/6e3ed7cd
Feb 07 17:25:39 <bmbouter>	and /usr/bin/vlc exists and that is what I can run successfully from the term
Feb 07 17:30:15 *	tmsmr1 is now known as tmsmr
Feb 07 17:32:14 <linuxmodder>	that looks sane, not sure what is causing your issues its not the .desktop file tho

Feb 07 18:41:22 <Old_Man>	Is anyone qualified to update https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Raspberry_Pi ?
Feb 07 18:41:52 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210129 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Feb 07 18:42:05 <Old_Man>	I think now would be the best time to do it, as people are upset at the default install of Raspberry Pi OS for installing a Microsoft repository and GPG key without asking permission.
Feb 07 18:42:42 <Old_Man>	Fedora could distinguish itself as being freedom-friendly by not being so "sneaky" to its users.
Feb 07 18:44:36 <[R]>	lol
Feb 07 18:44:38 <[R]>	rspberry pi os is made for people that dont know what they are doing
Feb 07 18:44:47 <[R]>	proiding an easy way to install code is exactly that
Feb 07 18:44:47 <[R]>	lol
Feb 07 18:45:02 <[R]>	i woudln't exactly classify it as sneaky
Feb 07 18:45:17 <Old_Man>	[R], that sounds like a good reason for Fedora to do it properly. Do you know who might have permission to make updates to that wiki page?
Feb 07 18:45:21 <[R]>	and obvilsy ythe people t hat actually knwo what they are doing, realize that
Feb 07 18:47:15 <[R]>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Help:Editing
Feb 07 18:47:15 <[R]>	wow
Feb 07 18:47:15 <[R]>	that was extremely difficult to find
Feb 07 18:48:47 <Old_Man>	I guess I didn't ask my question very clearly the second time; I'll go back to the wording I used the first time I asked it: "Is anyone qualified to update https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Raspberry_Pi ?"
Feb 07 18:48:56 <linuxmodder>	[R], taking advantage of less informed customer base it sure is tho
Feb 07 18:48:58 <[R]>	Old_Man: i just linked you the page so you can edit it yourself
Feb 07 18:49:05 <[R]>	if you think theres somethign wrong with it
Feb 07 18:49:20 <[R]>	linuxmodder: "taking advantage"
Feb 07 18:49:20 <[R]>	rofl
Feb 07 18:49:25 <[R]>	people who think its is some giant spying conpiracy
Feb 07 18:49:25 <Old_Man>	I mean, even if I made the text edits myself, I would want to work with someone who knows the current status of fedora-on-pi better than me, because all I know is what I read on other web pages like https://linuxhint.com/install_fedora_33_raspberry_pi4/
Feb 07 18:49:25 <[R]>	are retards
Feb 07 18:49:46 <[R]>	well if you think its wrong...
Feb 07 18:49:53 <linuxmodder>	well, I prefer attempting to educate your userbase but not really if they wanna continue being ill informed sheep they deserve it most times
Feb 07 18:49:55 <Old_Man>	Ohhhh, you're just a snarky namecaller. You're one of those people who calls names without actually contributing anything of value to any conversation on IRC. I see.
Feb 07 18:50:14 <Old_Man>	Well, does anyone *besides* [R] know anything about the status of fedora-on-pi?
Feb 07 18:50:20 <[R]>	so you dont know its wrong...
Feb 07 18:50:47 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  the folks in #fedora-arm likely do
Feb 07 18:50:54 <g0z>	so since I downloaded another distro and was waiting for this to lock up again before starting the install, it hasn't. what kind of selfpreservation AI wizardry is this?
Feb 07 18:50:59 <Old_Man>	Thanks, linuxmodder.
Feb 07 18:51:37 <linuxmodder>	and no [R] is not a random asshat namecaller but if the shoe fits he wears it well :P
Feb 07 18:51:39 <linuxmodder>	love you [R]  in case it was not clear
Feb 07 18:51:39 <[R]>	hey now, don't go talking about my shoes
Feb 07 18:51:57 <linuxmodder>	I love your style and class of attire sir sorry
Feb 07 18:52:13 <Old_Man>	Well, there's some merit to the idea that if you want to call people "retards," you should probably not misspell the simple words you're using to justify your namecalling, like "conpiracy." Literacy first, if you want to denigrate others, know what I mean? :D
Feb 07 18:52:17 <g0z>	I don't. take them shoes off and send pics of them.
Feb 07 18:53:30 <linuxmodder>	g0z, woah
Feb 07 18:53:45 <[R]>	rofl
Feb 07 18:53:54 <g0z>	putting the great back in denigrate imo
Feb 07 18:53:54 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  was not meant as a dig, nor personal
Feb 07 18:54:35 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  we get ALOT of trolls and folks that could easily google this or that in 2secs so some of us long beards get a bit abrasive sorry no sorry it is what it is
Feb 07 18:54:59 <Old_Man>	Nah, calling people "retards" is indeed always meant as a dig. But, you know, if he wants to turn over a new leaf, he could always just present evidence of his opinion: like, showing where the Raspberry Pi Foundation documented clearly what they were doing, why, and how to opt out for those who didn't want it.
Feb 07 18:55:18 <Old_Man>	(Except they didn't, so he can't, so the point stands.)
Feb 07 18:55:20 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  you do realize most of these are open source VOLUNTEER efforts yes?
Feb 07 18:55:46 <linuxmodder>	aka people have day jobs too and squeze this in as they can
Feb 07 18:55:46 <Old_Man>	Yes, of course... I've been volunteering with open source projects for many decades.
Feb 07 18:56:02 <Old_Man>	I can't remember, in those decades, ever calling someone a "retard" in the course of that volunteer work.
Feb 07 18:56:28 <Old_Man>	It's almost like... that's not a necessary thing to do, in order to volunteer in a free and open source software project.
Feb 07 18:56:36 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man, just a kind reminder, you could always try ebing part of the solution and make those changes or educate folks yourself, be the cahnge you wanna see and it will manifest
Feb 07 18:56:40 <Old_Man>	linuxmodder, which is exactly why I asked the questions I did.
Feb 07 18:56:49 <Old_Man>	And I appreciate you giving me the pointer in the right direction.
Feb 07 18:56:55 <Old_Man>	So thank you.
Feb 07 18:57:37 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  for me at least it seemed you came in more with an aggressive screw these folks mindset not a I wanna help so sorry for my attitude
Feb 07 18:58:46 <Old_Man>	Well, allow me to offer a gentle correction: I *do* in fact want to help, but I lack the exact knowledge of any behind-the-scenes effort to get Fedora running on Raspberry Pi 4, so I'd like to know who to talk to about it.
Feb 07 18:59:15 <Old_Man>	When the only *official* word is over a year old, and there are *unofficial* sources that make it look like it's progressed a lot from there, I *might* be able to help with documentation, but only if I know who's been updating it and how.
Feb 07 19:00:01 <linuxmodder>	Old_Man,  the official pi on fedora project effort is to my knowledge dead like the dinos, but is possible via fedoraon arm
Feb 07 19:00:05 <linuxmodder>	hence #fedora-arm
Feb 07 19:01:41 <Old_Man>	And unfortunately, the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM page still links to the old-and-suspected-now-incorrect page I linked earlier.
Feb 07 19:03:25 <linuxmodder>	try asking in #fedora-arm and/or labs.fedoraproject.org and try say python-science-arm
Feb 07 19:03:27 <linuxmodder>	as a starting point

Feb 07 21:25:11 <jakelazaroff>	@cmurf nope, only three logs from systemd-journald are "journal started", "runtime journal" with a path and some numbers, and then "journal stopped"
Feb 07 21:26:03 <cmurf>	ahh well it's normal for there to be one "stopped" because at first it's running from the initramfs
Feb 07 21:26:14 <cmurf>	and it stops and restarts from disk
Feb 07 21:26:41 <cmurf>	[    4.021638] flap.local systemd-journald[217]: Journal stopped
Feb 07 21:26:43 <cmurf>	that's normal
Feb 07 21:26:48 <jakelazaroff>	ah okay
Feb 07 21:26:50 <cmurf>	if you have two, that's unusual
Feb 07 21:27:15 <jakelazaroff>	i just have the one
Feb 07 21:27:21 <jakelazaroff>	the entirety of the journald logs span like two seconds
Feb 07 21:27:47 <cmurf>	less than a second later i've got
Feb 07 21:27:49 <cmurf>	[    4.846606] flap.local systemd-journald[499]: Journal started
Feb 07 21:28:00 <jakelazaroff>	that i don't have
Feb 07 21:28:58 <cmurf>	journalctl -b -o short-monotonic -u systemd-journald
Feb 07 21:29:54 <jakelazaroff>	-o short-monotonic = that bracketed number on the left, the number of seconds since boot?
Feb 07 21:30:06 <cmurf>	yes
Feb 07 21:30:35 <jakelazaroff>	that's neat, thanks
Feb 07 21:30:37 <cmurf>	personal preference i guess, makes it easier to find unexpected gaps in the log
Feb 07 21:30:50 <cmurf>	more like dmesg
Feb 07 21:31:00 <jakelazaroff>	same three logs though
Feb 07 21:31:35 <cmurf>	journalctl --verify
Feb 07 21:31:52 <jakelazaroff>	did that before, it passes
Feb 07 21:32:14 <jakelazaroff>	there's a folder in /var/log/journal as well
Feb 07 21:32:15 <cmurf>	ok
Feb 07 21:32:21 <cmurf>	that's normal
Feb 07 21:32:27 <cmurf>	tht's the persistent journal location
Feb 07 21:32:49 <cmurf>	on fedora, /etc/systemd/journald.conf defaults to storage=auto which means if the /var/log/journal exists, use that
Feb 07 21:33:02 <cmurf>	if it doesn't, then it's in /run/log/journal which is volatile
Feb 07 21:33:29 <cmurf>	what do you get for 'systemctl status systemd-journald'
Feb 07 21:33:57 <jakelazaroff>	green, active
Feb 07 21:36:20 <cmurf>	and it's logging things still? except for one service?
Feb 07 21:36:30 <jakelazaroff>	no, sorry, i think that was a red herring
Feb 07 21:36:46 <jakelazaroff>	the logs stop after that first "journal stopped"
Feb 07 21:37:04 <jakelazaroff>	i misread the logs beforehand and thought they were still coming in
Feb 07 21:37:17 <cmurf>	what's the time stamp for /var/log/journal/$MACHINEID/system.journal
Feb 07 21:37:25 <cmurf>	is it stale?
Feb 07 21:38:26 <cmurf>	something like 'sudo systemctl restart packagekit' is enough to force both the sudo command and the service restart to be inserted into the journal
Feb 07 21:38:54 <cmurf>	and it should show up just by 'journalctl --since=-1m'
Feb 07 21:39:01 <cmurf>	that's -1m
Feb 07 21:39:32 <cmurf>	sorta funny to me, as if +1m could exist and act like a time machine
Feb 07 21:39:46 <jakelazaroff>	lol you could set your clock back i suppose
Feb 07 21:39:58 <jakelazaroff>	um sorry tho, what do you mean by timestamp for that file
Feb 07 21:40:01 <jakelazaroff>	last modified?
Feb 07 21:40:03 <cmurf>	yeah
Feb 07 21:40:14 <cmurf>	ls -l /var/log/journal/.../system.journal
Feb 07 21:40:19 <cmurf>	like is it being written to at all?
Feb 07 21:41:13 <jakelazaroff>	not stale, 20:41
Feb 07 21:41:19 <jakelazaroff>	both system.journal and user-1000.journal
Feb 07 21:41:27 <cmurf>	i haven't seen it recently but i've seen journald get confused due to corrupt journals (which you don't have) and it fails to show contents that are in the journal
Feb 07 21:41:34 <cmurf>	most of that stuff has been ironed out
Feb 07 21:41:39 <cmurf>	ok so it's writing to it
Feb 07 21:41:46 <cmurf>	but you have no recent entries
Feb 07 21:41:49 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210129 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Feb 07 21:42:00 <cmurf>	that is weird
Feb 07 21:42:05 <jakelazaroff>	yeah that's the confusing thing to me — the process is green, verify works fine
Feb 07 21:42:07 <cmurf>	i guess i would just start poking it with a stick
Feb 07 21:42:18 <cmurf>	like i'd probably just restart it
Feb 07 21:42:24 <cmurf>	systemctl restart systemd-journald
Feb 07 21:42:28 <cmurf>	see if that fixes it
Feb 07 21:42:45 <jakelazaroff>	so that works
Feb 07 21:42:47 <cmurf>	if not i'd 'journalctl --rotate' to force journal rotation
Feb 07 21:43:35 <cmurf>	it got stuck somehow
Feb 07 21:43:58 <jakelazaroff>	my problem here is that this is on servers that are getting started up automatically, so i can't manually restart systemd-journald every time
Feb 07 21:44:05 <cmurf>	so i dunno, haven't seen that one, you could have done 'sudo strace -p PID' for systemd-journald and see what it's doing and file a bug :P
Feb 07 21:44:45 <jakelazaroff>	going for the hacky fix here — is there a way to have it automatically restart systemd-journald on startup?
Feb 07 21:45:00 <cmurf>	this shouldn't happen regularly or it's a bug
Feb 07 21:45:20 <cmurf>	it does restart on startup already so making it do it again isn't gonna fix things
Feb 07 21:45:35 <cmurf>	it starts from initramfs, logs, restarts from disk, logs indefinitely
Feb 07 21:45:58 <cmurf>	so if it's getting stuck on every reboot that's not good
Feb 07 21:46:02 <cmurf>	this is f33? or rawhide?
Feb 07 21:46:16 <jakelazaroff>	f32
Feb 07 21:46:19 <cmurf>	hmm
Feb 07 21:46:41 <cmurf>	and this happens on every reboot?
Feb 07 21:46:44 <cmurf>	it just gets stuck?
Feb 07 21:48:53 <jakelazaroff>	to give a little more context, these are servers on digitalocean from an image i'm building with packer. so basically what happens is a server boots up, gets provisioned, the disk gets saved as an image, and then that becomes the template for new servers
Feb 07 21:49:02 <jakelazaroff>	so whenever i spin up a server from that image, this happens
Feb 07 21:49:53 <cmurf>	uhh hmm
Feb 07 21:50:53 <jakelazaroff>	although… this is super weird — if i reboot the server, it works fine
Feb 07 21:52:28 <LeoNice81>	Can I ask some general irc questions please?
Feb 07 21:55:31 <LeoNice81>	I'm using #Revolution IRC for Android anyone familiar with it?
Feb 07 21:57:34 <Khaytsus>	LeoNice81: Wrong channel?
Feb 07 21:57:49 <cmurf>	jakelazaroff: it sounds like a new server provisioned from the cloned image is confusing the running server?
Feb 07 21:57:53 <cmurf>	that can't be coincidence
Feb 07 21:57:54 <LeoNice81>	No I've been gone from the

Feb 07 22:04:18 <cmurf>	jakelazaroff: it doesn't get refreshed, it should be removed from the template i think
Feb 07 22:04:33 <cmurf>	/etc/machine-id
Feb 07 22:04:47 <IPFreely>	Hi
Feb 07 22:04:54 <IPFreely>	How do I check my OS DNS setting? commands dig, host, nslookup aren't working.. do I really need to install some packages for this?
Feb 07 22:05:05 <[R]>	IPFreely: cat /etc/resolv.conf
Feb 07 22:05:27 <IPFreely>	thanks
Feb 07 22:05:35 <Khaytsus>	IPFreely: Have you modified any configs?  that should all just work generally
Feb 07 22:05:51 <IPFreely>	It does work, I just wanted to check what I have assigned from DHCP
Feb 07 22:07:29 <jakelazaroff>	@cmurf it should be the same as /run/log/journal/MACHINE_ID right?
Feb 07 22:08:27 <LeoNice81>	Khartoum im typing by fingertips right now. I am a Fedora user have been since 97, however, I've been away from all tech for 14 straight years!
Feb 07 22:08:38 <cmurf>	/etc/machine-id gets set at install time by some script, and from that is how systemd sets machineid for use wherever it gets used including for journals
Feb 07 22:09:04 <cmurf>	the thing is, if these servers aren't all talkign to each other, they aren't going to know the same machine-id is being used among all of them
Feb 07 22:09:33 <jakelazaroff>	yeah they shouldn't be
Feb 07 22:10:58 <jakelazaroff>	maybe i'll try adding this to the provisioning script https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/648251372815560704

Feb 08 16:52:24 <slop>	Hi does anyone use Citrix Workspace?
Feb 08 16:54:05 <Twindigit[m]1>	Yeah, that's a doozy to set up
Feb 08 16:54:25 <slop>	thats what I was afraid of.
Feb 08 16:59:39 <slop>	I read a few blogs/posts about extracting pem files from bundles and started thinking is that a good idea? would they receive updates?!
Feb 08 17:01:15 <amarok>	hi. Was there a recent changes in networking I missed? I updated my version like 2 days ago and since then I can't do any dnf update, some soft cannot connect, a git pull take like 2 minutes before fetching

Feb 08 19:11:02 <Twindigit[m]1>	<slop "ok great!"> BTW: Sudo all the things. I just went over the procedure again.
Feb 08 19:11:04 <mohab[m]>	Any idea if I can use DNF to keep a package from upgrading? It keeps letting MAME upgrade and some of my ROMs don't work on the new version. Usually, the option to disable auto-upgrades is provided by the application, but I couldn't find any in MAME.
Feb 08 19:11:50 <slop>	I really appreciate this!
Feb 08 19:11:52 <slop>	thank you
Feb 08 19:18:25 <Amgine[m]>	Question: My Fedora 33 updates the kernel, but does not actually use the updated kernel on reboot. The most recent update was 5.10.13, but:
Feb 08 19:18:25 <Amgine[m]>	`$ uname -r
Feb 08 19:18:25 <Amgine[m]>	5.10.8-200.fc33.x86_64`
Feb 08 19:19:05 <Amgine[m]>	How do I boot with the latest kernel?
Feb 08 19:25:41 <mohab[m]>	<mohab[m] "Any idea if I can use DNF to kee"> Nevrmind. I found the versionlock plugin.
Feb 08 19:26:18 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: can you do 'sudo grub2-editenv list'
Feb 08 19:26:51 <slop>	Which IRC client do you recommend?
Feb 08 19:27:35 *	Amgine[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/CMsbgbfBblmDRtcdguRzPUHn/message.txt >
Feb 08 19:28:17 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: ok that explains why it's booting 5.10.8, question is why it didn't get updated
Feb 08 19:28:46 <Amgine[m]>	I'd really love to blame Apple here...
Feb 08 19:28:47 <cmurf>	can you 'fpaste | /etc/default/grub'
Feb 08 19:29:03 <cmurf>	i don't think it's an Apple problem in this case haha
Feb 08 19:29:16 <Amgine[m]>	I know, I know... <sigh>
Feb 08 19:29:17 <cmurf>	any GRUB customizations since installation?
Feb 08 19:29:43 <cmurf>	there is a simple fix but i'd like to know why it's not updating the saved entry
Feb 08 19:29:43 <slop>	are we moving back to LILO in version 34? :D
Feb 08 19:29:57 <cmurf>	GRUB OS
Feb 08 19:29:59 <cmurf>	haha
Feb 08 19:31:03 <cmurf>	slop: i'm using weechat on Fedora Server, then connect from my laptop via ssh, upon login it automatically loads a tmux session where, viola, weechat is running
Feb 08 19:31:12 <Amgine[m]>	The fpaste line gives me a permission denied and sits there.
Feb 08 19:31:35 <cmurf>	but eventually Fedora is moving to matrix natively so i'm not making any changes until i understand the new world (which will still have IRC)
Feb 08 19:31:38 <slop>	cmurf thank you -  I am currently using hexchat and didnt know if something else was recommended/more up to date etc
Feb 08 19:31:48 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: ahh sorry, add sudo
Feb 08 19:31:54 <cmurf>	'sudo fpaste /etc/default/grub'
Feb 08 19:32:03 <Amgine[m]>	Oh, no pipe.
Feb 08 19:32:19 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: oh i'm an idiot :P
Feb 08 19:32:22 <cmurf>	that was a typo
Feb 08 19:32:28 <Amgine[m]>	https://paste.centos.org/view/b4f20e31
Feb 08 19:32:33 *	cmurf cannot multitask
Feb 08 19:33:03 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: ok it's default, hmm
Feb 08 19:33:32 <cmurf>	'sudo ls -l /boot/loader/entries/ | fpaste'
Feb 08 19:33:57 <Amgine[m]>	https://paste.centos.org/view/686b4e55
Feb 08 19:34:17 <cmurf>	curious, the bls snippet for it is there
Feb 08 19:34:23 <cmurf>	ok well to fix it:
Feb 08 19:34:34 <cmurf>	sudo grub2-set-default fdab6eb99ac24d64af49e72c11c125ad-5.10.13-200.fc33.x86_64
Feb 08 19:35:02 <Amgine[m]>	<looks for that>
Feb 08 19:35:25 <cmurf>	it's a blind command, there's no reply
Feb 08 19:35:42 <cmurf>	if you want to confirm 'sudo grub2-editenv list'
Feb 08 19:35:51 <cmurf>	it should now be the saved entry
Feb 08 19:35:55 <Amgine[m]>	No, I am wondering where you got the hash, in case I need to do that for 5.10.14, etc.
Feb 08 19:35:57 <cmurf>	if it's not then we have an aha! moment
Feb 08 19:36:16 <cmurf>	ahh, yeah good point, so look at the /boot/loader/entries listing
Feb 08 19:36:25 <cmurf>	it's just that conf file without the ending
Feb 08 19:36:32 <cmurf>	remove the last 5 characters, .conf
Feb 08 19:37:22 <Amgine[m]>	<nods> Perfect. Now to write myself a note so I when I run into this in a few days/weeks I will have reference.
Feb 08 19:37:37 <cmurf>	if you do, it's a bug and we need to find out why
Feb 08 19:38:09 <cmurf>	but does grub2-editenv list show the change?
Feb 08 19:38:10 <Amgine[m]>	Aha! and then I get to blame Steve Jobs...
Feb 08 19:38:22 <cmurf>	if it doesn't show the change then that's the problem
Feb 08 19:38:27 <Amgine[m]>	Yes, the change is there.
Feb 08 19:38:42 <cmurf>	ok hmm, well that grubenv file is accepting the change at least
Feb 08 19:39:36 <cmurf>	so yeah on macs, the thing we use on Fedora for /boot/efi is not the real EFI System partition
Feb 08 19:39:44 <cmurf>	but a small HFS+ partition
Feb 08 19:39:58 <slop>	macs. /me washes hands.
Feb 08 19:40:09 <cmurf>	the reason is for mactel-boot stuff, so that you see a pretty Fedora logo when you boot with option key at the startup chime
Feb 08 19:40:13 <cmurf>	:D
Feb 08 19:40:33 <Amgine[m]>	<nods> I wiped this one so it is only Fedora, which may be the issue?
Feb 08 19:40:55 <cmurf>	basically there are some files on that HFS+ faux-ESP that make Apple firmware think Fedora's GRUB is actually macos haha
Feb 08 19:41:01 <cmurf>	but anyway...
Feb 08 19:41:09 <slop>	hey I saw a post on reddit about about the splash screen for system updates performed via gnome. guys, ive got to tell you. thats a great move. Its something that my parents and other non technical people are COMFORTABLE with.
Feb 08 19:41:11 <cmurf>	no i don't think so, this is all self contained to Fedora
Feb 08 19:41:29 <slop>	a lot better than me telling my 70+ year old parents ok open a terminal. now
Feb 08 19:41:56 <cmurf>	yeah they just get updates automatically really, out of the box
Feb 08 19:42:08 <Amgine[m]>	kk. Well, thanks for the quick solution, and I will keep you apprised if there are future similar behaviors.
Feb 08 19:42:11 <slop>	Its a step in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded/outside of technical people updates. and making updates LESS scary so theya re applied.
Feb 08 19:42:16 <cmurf>	you just reboot and once every week or two (sometimes more often due to firefox or a kernel security fix) you get updates on the reboot
Feb 08 19:42:22 <slop>	^^
Feb 08 19:42:59 <cmurf>	Amgine[m]: yeah because the kernel package is responsible for writing that that conf file, and then also updating the grub environment file
Feb 08 19:43:07 <coppice>	slop: you do realise that it was people who are 70+ who developed the opening of terminal windows?
Feb 08 19:44:46 <akik>	cmurf: on an 2011 imac, the efi system partition is a normal vfat partition. there's an installer bug that makes it so that you can't install the boot loader in the installer
Feb 08 19:45:25 <cmurf>	akik: there is a real FAT32 ESP but Apple only uses it for firmware update staging
Feb 08 19:45:32 <cmurf>	they don't use it for booting and neither does Fedora
Feb 08 19:45:42 <akik>	cmurf: my machine uses it for booting
Feb 08 19:45:50 <slop>	coppice, not my farming parents. they didnt have an email address until it was required. I tell them theres NOTHING they can break on fedora that we can either figure out or reload.
Feb 08 19:45:55 <akik>	i.e. /boot/efi/EFI/fedora is in there
Feb 08 19:46:12 <cmurf>	akik: lsblk -f | fpaste
Feb 08 19:46:38 <cmurf>	because the installer, if it knows it's on a mac, will create /boot/efi on HFS+, it will not reuse the FAT32 ESP
Feb 08 19:47:04 <cmurf>	there is a bug in the f33 installer where it creates both FAT32 and HFS+ partitions, but only uses the HFS+ one for /boot/efi
Feb 08 19:47:51 <cmurf>	the unused FAT32 volume is left untouched - forever ghosted
Feb 08 19:48:21 <akik>	cmurf: that's where the installer goes wrong. it should just use the existing esp
Feb 08 19:49:59 <akik>	cmurf: here's the lsblk https://paste.centos.org/view/7c9d7479
Feb 08 19:50:57 <akik>	maybe the difference is that i'm using apfs and not hfs
Feb 08 19:51:13 <akik>	for the macos partition
Feb 08 20:01:40 <cmurf>	akik: did you modify this after installation?
Feb 08 20:01:44 <cmurf>	├─sda1 vfat   FAT32 EFI   2860-11F4                               148M    25% /boot/efi
Feb 08 20:03:24 <akik>	cmurf: no it contains some apple stuff. one thing that i just now remembers was that i use that other boot loader per default, refind
Feb 08 20:03:44 <cmurf>	that's interesting because Apple had used a 200M FAT32 ESP for a very long time, since the start of EFI with x86 macs
Feb 08 20:04:16 <cmurf>	Soo it must be that whatever does the test for "is it a mac" isn't working with newer macs? HUH
Feb 08 20:04:21 <cmurf>	but you said this is a 2011 mac
Feb 08 20:04:36 <akik>	cmurf: yes
Feb 08 20:04:50 <cmurf>	my 2009 and 2012 macs both behave the way i've described though
Feb 08 20:04:55 <akik>	cmurf: my only apple hardware
Feb 08 20:05:06 <akik>	and it's probably going out of support soon
Feb 08 20:05:09 <cmurf>	the installer doesn't use FAT32 ESP, it'll only use HFS+ for /boot/efi
Feb 08 20:05:17 <akik>	why's that?
Feb 08 20:05:25 <akik>	i have apple's stuff in there
Feb 08 20:05:38 <akik>	and now also fedora's
Feb 08 20:05:56 <cmurf>	like i said earlier, it's part of mactel-boot stuff to make it easier for mac users
Feb 08 20:06:06 <akik>	i can paste the contents if you want
Feb 08 20:06:25 <cmurf>	originally Fedora also appeared in the Startup panel, but i think Apple broke that part and now only the built-in firmware Boot Manager shows Fedora
Feb 08 20:07:07 <cmurf>	did you use Custom partitioning? or Advanced-Custom?
Feb 08 20:07:23 <akik>	if i try to install fedora or centos on it, i'm just getting some weird error like efi system partition can't be of type esp
Feb 08 20:07:32 <cmurf>	that's correct
Feb 08 20:07:44 <akik>	then i need to unselect the install boot loader in the installer and after install, install it
Feb 08 20:08:12 <cmurf>	oh ok so you're just being stubborn and want to do things your way rather than the installer's way :D
Feb 08 20:08:14 <cmurf>	i get it
Feb 08 20:08:20 <cmurf>	i'm the same way sometimes
Feb 08 20:09:13 <akik>	cmurf: the installer doesn't work
Feb 08 20:09:25 <cmurf>	it does it you don't fight it
Feb 08 20:09:32 <akik>	cmurf: if i would use the installer, i couldn't get the machine booting fedora
Feb 08 20:09:37 <cmurf>	if you just let it do things the way it wants (automatic) then it works fine
Feb 08 20:09:44 <akik>	sheesh
Feb 08 20:09:46 <cmurf>	haha
Feb 08 20:10:11 <akik>	this is so common. refusing to get the facts you're presented with
Feb 08 20:10:32 <akik>	i have no hfs partition on that machine
Feb 08 20:10:45 <cmurf>	it'll create it
Feb 08 20:10:50 <akik>	no it doesn't
Feb 08 20:11:01 <cmurf>	yes it does, i've only done 10000 installations :P
Feb 08 20:11:06 <akik>	i found the solution on redhat's bugzilla
Feb 08 20:11:37 <cmurf>	you must be doing Custom or Advanced-Custom installation, because that error message only happens in those paths
Feb 08 20:11:45 <akik>	yes i always do that
Feb 08 20:11:55 <foxide>	Maybe don't?
Feb 08 20:12:05 <akik>	oh come on grow up
Feb 08 20:12:13 <cmurf>	ok and if you create /boot/efi on a mac as Linux HFS+ EFI, you do not get the error you're talking about
Feb 08 20:12:40 <foxide>	You don't even need to do that. FAT32 EFI works just fine, Apple EFI looks for the fallback bootloader same as UEFI implementations.
Feb 08 20:12:42 <cmurf>	you only get the error if you try to force it to do something it has a rule against doing
Feb 08 20:12:52 <akik>	so fedora has decided not to use the common esp on macs as with any other platform?
Feb 08 20:12:57 <cmurf>	correct
Feb 08 20:13:01 <akik>	so silly :)
Feb 08 20:13:08 <foxide>	Fedora didn't decide anything, you're the one doing a custom install.
Feb 08 20:13:10 <foxide>	YOU decided.
Feb 08 20:13:18 <cmurf>	dude i just explained why, why are you ignoring that?
Feb 08 20:13:28 <akik>	foxide: there's an esp on the disk. why shouldn't i use it?
Feb 08 20:13:36 <foxide>	Are you trying to dual boot?
Feb 08 20:13:49 <cmurf>	Because Apple's firmware ignores it except as a final fallback volume
Feb 08 20:14:01 <cmurf>	we wanted users to see a nice Fedora logo in the built-in boot manager
Feb 08 20:14:09 <cmurf>	you only get that if the files are on an HFS+ volume
Feb 08 20:14:23 <akik>	foxide: yes i'm dual booting but i'll remove macos when it drops out of support
Feb 08 20:14:54 <akik>	haven't booted it in a while
Feb 08 20:16:21 <cmurf>	I admit the error message doesn't really tell you exactly what you need to do - i've argued for a long time that all this bootloader stuff in GUI installers should just go away
Feb 08 20:16:32 <cmurf>	let the installer do it all correctly behind the scenes, no customizations
Feb 08 20:16:48 <akik>	shouldn't you then disable the custom and advanced custom options?
Feb 08 20:16:58 <cmurf>	why?
Feb 08 20:17:01 <foxide>	That's called "don't select them."
Feb 08 20:17:03 <akik>	if they don't work
Feb 08 20:17:12 <foxide>	They do work, if you know what you're doing.
Feb 08 20:17:13 <cmurf>	they *do work* you are just fighting its rules
Feb 08 20:17:30 <akik>	foxide: could you like keep the tone civil
Feb 08 20:17:56 <foxide>	I am being civil. That you don't like the facts being presented to you doesn't make me uncivil.
Feb 08 20:18:00 <cmurf>	akik: :D come on! you are hardly in a position to ask other people to keep the tone civil when you just told other people to "grow up"
Feb 08 20:18:15 <akik>	cmurf: yes i tell it like it is if people act up
Feb 08 20:18:19 <cmurf>	LOL
Feb 08 20:18:25 <cmurf>	you can dish it out but can't take it, got it
Feb 08 20:18:36 <akik>	he was saying i shouldn't use the custom partitioning
Feb 08 20:18:57 <foxide>	The outcomes of your attempts seem to lend credence to my advice.
Feb 08 20:19:10 <cmurf>	you guys are both correct :D
Feb 08 20:19:19 <cmurf>	(a) custom is custom, you're expect to know what you're doing
Feb 08 20:19:29 <linuxmodder>	cmurf,  or only with a custom ( you shoot yourself at your own risk, experts only) for efi bootloader
Feb 08 20:19:32 <akik>	foxide: the attempts ended when i found the reason for the problem from bugzilla
Feb 08 20:19:34 <cmurf>	(b) bootloader stuff is esoteric and should not be exposed to users in GUI installers
Feb 08 20:20:26 <cmurf>	linuxmodder: yeah i agree although i also think bootloader stuff is sufficiently esoteric (being eyeballs deep in this territory for over 10 years) that not even experts understand it well enough to expose them to this torture
Feb 08 20:20:49 <foxide>	cmurf: Speak for yourself. :P
Feb 08 20:21:01 <linuxmodder>	cmurf,  fair
Feb 08 20:21:09 <linuxmodder>	foxide,  seriously get off it
Feb 08 20:21:29 <foxide>	linuxmodder: Wasn't talking to you. At all.
Feb 08 20:21:33 <linuxmodder>	just because you appear to hate on mac or custom setups is no right to be so nasty
Feb 08 20:21:49 <foxide>	Uh, what? I've run Fedora on every mac I've owned for 11 years. Nice assumption. :P
Feb 08 20:22:00 <cmurf>	so anyway...
Feb 08 20:22:22 <cmurf>	did everyone see that lkml link i posted about M1 macs? :D
Feb 08 20:22:27 *	cmurf quickly changes the subject
Feb 08 20:22:28 <foxide>	cmurf: I did not!
Feb 08 20:22:36 <linuxmodder>	cmurf,  heard you mention it never saw it tho
Feb 08 20:22:56 <foxide>	linuxmodder: I never appeared to hate on Macs or custom setups. I DID say that you're expected to know what you're doing. So, get off it. :)
Feb 08 20:23:02 <linuxmodder>	not gonna lie the m1 might be enough for me to justify the $$$ of macs
Feb 08 20:23:03 <cmurf>	https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/2/4/1177
Feb 08 20:23:45 <linuxmodder>	cmurf,  nice
Feb 08 20:23:49 <foxide>	cmurf: I'm not even through the first part of this and I'm encountering terms I've NEVER seen before.
Feb 08 20:24:55 <linuxmodder>	tl'dr insane mobile desktop chip for once that uses arm logic
Feb 08 20:25:41 <linuxmodder>	I love how macs sip on resources but that $$ has been a sticking point the m1 might be enough for me to jump that hurdle tho
Feb 08 20:26:22 <linuxmodder>	iphone 12 can pretty much out do the current macs efficiency wise the m1 is slated to change that
Feb 08 20:27:08 <foxide>	That said, I am nowhere near as knowledgeable on ARM stuff.
Feb 08 20:27:40 <cmurf>	i bought a 13" hp spectre to run fedora on about 4.5 years ago, 2.4 pounds - mainly because the macbook pro 2011 is like 6 pounds
Feb 08 20:27:51 <foxide>	Yeah, it was a hoss.
Feb 08 20:28:16 <cmurf>	but the 2011 mac has held up better, except for the discrete GPU which is kaput, than the hp which has keys dying
Feb 08 20:28:36 <slop>	Hey! is this Fedora channel or no? :D
Feb 08 20:28:49 <cmurf>	and this USB-C power business, which seems like a good idea to have one plug to rule them all; but in practice it's annoying
Feb 08 20:28:52 <foxide>	slop: Sure. Fedora is an amazing distro for Mac hardware.
Feb 08 20:28:53 <cmurf>	fragile
Feb 08 20:29:09 <slop>	oh snap hehe
Feb 08 20:29:10 <foxide>	I've had better luck running Fedora on Mac hardware than any other distro.
Feb 08 20:29:40 <cmurf>	Intel NUC: fedora; MacbookPro: fedora, hp laptop: fedora
Feb 08 20:29:42 <Amgine[m]>	It is certainly keeping this 2013 Macbook Air running as a daily.
Feb 08 20:30:46 <cmurf>	BTW anyone who runs into the amd gpu problem, there's a way to have GRUB power it off so the kernel doesn't even see it
Feb 08 20:31:11 <cmurf>	runs i915 graphics just fine
Feb 08 20:32:30 <Amgine[m]>	cmurf: do you have the FacetimeHD camera running on your Macbook?
Feb 08 20:33:01 <cmurf>	i don't think this macbookpro has a facetimehd camera but it does have a camera and it is working
Feb 08 20:33:02 <linuxmodder>	cmurf,  what soem grub line voodoo?
Feb 08 20:33:13 <cmurf>	i used it for bluejeans worstation working group meetings
Feb 08 20:33:18 <linuxmodder>	rd.amd_blacklist style
Feb 08 20:33:29 <cmurf>	linuxmodder: no, way weirder
Feb 08 20:33:37 <linuxmodder>	oh lovely
Feb 08 20:33:40 <akik>	cmurf: which kernel parameter is it?
Feb 08 20:34:09 <akik>	i could test it on the imac even though the radeon is working fine
Feb 08 20:34:40 <cmurf>	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=765954#c65
Feb 08 20:34:43 <slop>	I love how clean gnome is for Fedora. just so clean.
Feb 08 20:35:22 <akik>	cmurf: oh it's a bit more than just a kernel parameter
Feb 08 20:35:33 <cmurf>	oh yeah :P
Feb 08 20:35:40 <slop>	Ive installed other ....big name.. distros and was like whoa thats a lot of bloat. I keep coming back to red hat/fedora since before fedora was a thing. Same with freenode really.
Feb 08 20:35:43 <linuxmodder>	too resource hungry but looks sexy indeed
Feb 08 20:37:44 <foxide>	RHL 7.1, baby
Feb 08 20:38:04 <cmurf>	what i can't answer is if you have working amd graphics, whether switcheroo always uses i915 graphics unconditionally
Feb 08 20:38:10 <linuxmodder>	oh lord that is ancient
Feb 08 20:38:11 <cmurf>	i'm not sure that it switches
Feb 08 20:38:12 <slop>	is there any thoughts of adding gnome-tweaks as a default install?
Feb 08 20:38:36 <cmurf>	slop: not likely to happen

Feb 08 21:52:41 <slop>	for a fresh fedora install for some reason videos will stop playing on youtube.
Feb 08 21:52:55 <slop>	Im thinking they are like nah, sorry dude. use windows
Feb 08 21:53:47 <slop>	of course I say that then close and reopen the browser and it starts playing **tinfoil hat**
Feb 08 21:58:29 <quippy>	reminds me of the good old days of installing Flash to get that kind of thing working
Feb 08 21:59:22 <slop>	^^
Feb 08 22:10:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	slop rpmfusion repos enabled
Feb 08 22:10:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	ffmpg i think is the needed package
Feb 08 22:12:11 <slop>	never used rpmfusion, neat - will look into this!
Feb 08 22:12:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	slop take a look at http://rpmfusion.org/Configuration
Feb 08 22:12:52 <slop>	was actually just reading it :D free for Open Source Software (as defined by the Fedo
Feb 08 22:12:57 <slop>	thank you!!
Feb 08 22:13:41 <slop>	are these "secure" do you trust them?
Feb 08 22:13:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	slop yep codecs and things that cannot be included in fedora
Feb 08 22:14:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	slop i have been using them since they were created
Feb 08 22:14:31 <slop>	ok cool thank you!!
Feb 08 22:14:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	rpmfusion maintainers also maintain other packages in fedora so yes i ttrust them

Feb 08 23:53:27 <cmurf>	cyberpear: this is the second confirmed bug related to systemd-resolved i've come across in a simple case
Feb 08 23:53:53 <cmurf>	actually this is the 3rd if we count me :D
Feb 08 23:54:25 <cmurf>	so the other one i came across was on reddit, where the user has wifi and wired at the same time, and it takes something like 30 seconds or more for firefox to launch
Feb 08 23:54:31 <cmurf>	and maybe some other effects i forget
Feb 08 23:55:01 <cmurf>	and if 'systemctl stop systemd-resolved' the problem goes away
Feb 08 23:55:21 <cmurf>	i don't think wireless + wired is an edge case, however uncommon

Feb 09 14:12:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats the traditional way of doing it #fedora-arm would have a better idea
Feb 09 14:30:30 <uwu_nani69[m]>	noob question here, but I can't install KVM-related packages
Feb 09 14:30:42 <Tabzlock[m]>	Which packages and have you used dnf search?
Feb 09 14:31:02 <uwu_nani69[m]>	I tried doing sudo dnf install virt-manager, it can't find anything
Feb 09 14:31:27 <Tabzlock[m]>	Ahh ok
Feb 09 14:31:33 <Tabzlock[m]>	Lemme do a quick look
Feb 09 14:32:20 <Tabzlock[m]>	It is a package
Feb 09 14:32:48 <uwu_nani69[m]>	It tells me that virt-manager is installed, yet when I open virsh, then type virt-manager &
Feb 09 14:32:48 <uwu_nani69[m]>	it doesnt do anything
Feb 09 14:32:48 <Khaytsus>	dnf install @virtualization     Just do this.
Feb 09 14:33:33 <Khaytsus>	Did you enable libvirtd?  Why are you running virsh?  (it's a command line tool to manage; you likely don't need this)
Feb 09 14:33:35 <Tabzlock[m]>	> <@uwu_nani69:matrix.org> It tells me that virt-manager is installed, yet when I open virsh, then type virt-manager &
Feb 09 14:33:36 <Tabzlock[m]>	> it doesnt do anything
Feb 09 14:33:36 <Tabzlock[m]>	Thats not the same as it cant find anything, it just thinks you have or you do have it installed.
Feb 09 14:34:11 <Tabzlock[m]>	Does it show in your launcher?
Feb 09 14:34:14 <uwu_nani69[m]>	<Khaytsus "dnf install @virtualization     "> oh okay so I've done this
Feb 09 14:34:26 <Khaytsus>	systemctl enable libvirtd --now
Feb 09 14:35:28 <uwu_nani69[m]>	okay so I've done all that
Feb 09 14:35:47 <uwu_nani69[m]>	sorry Im just learning kvm at the moment
Feb 09 14:35:50 <Tabzlock[m]>	Khaytsus: quick question isnt the libvirtd daemon also started by virt man if it wasnt previously enabled because I dont remember using that step last time I installed
Feb 09 14:35:54 <Khaytsus>	So what's the problem then?
Feb 09 14:35:59 <Khaytsus>	when you run virt-manager ?
Feb 09 14:36:20 <Khaytsus>	https://fedoramagazine.org/full-virtualization-system-on-fedora-workstation-30/     Also, perhaps this would be useful...

Feb 09 14:41:25 <Khaytsus>	They already said they sorted it.

Feb 09 14:54:13 <Khaytsus>	Tabzlock[m]: You were pestering a user who was trying to figure out something and had already solved it and now you're having problems with Matrix which is completely out of our hands.

Feb 09 14:57:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	we are seeing more and more spam from the matrix side eventually we will have to set the channel back to registered only
Feb 09 14:57:29 <Tabzlock[m]>	<Khaytsus "Tabzlock: You were pestering a u"> Look I was seriously delayed and what I was asking was a valid question I also had you completely take something I could handle away from me and now your both treating me like a child wtf is this.

Feb 10 13:24:37 <rustysysdev_>	There seems to be options for configuring wifi during kickstart, but the interface never comes up... is there something I might be doing wrong?  My configuration is as follows.

Feb 10 13:46:09 <rustysysdev_>	not much, I misunderstood I thought you were speaking to everyone, but it was a reply to Lohyna!
Feb 10 13:46:50 <rustysysdev_>	speaking of which how do you reply like that? or is that a matrix feature?
Feb 10 13:48:54 <Lohyna>	@AkA[m] Same, just sitting on online lessons, can't stand distance learning
Feb 10 13:49:36 <Lohyna>	Oh, God, how to am i need to write just nickname for reply, without "@"?
Feb 10 13:54:14 <akik>	Lohyna: you can write some 2 or 3 characters of the other party's nick and press tab
Feb 10 13:54:21 <akik>	Lohyna: this might not work in all client
Feb 10 13:54:24 <AkA[m]>	<rustysysdev_ "speaking of which how do you rep"> i don't get it what is you say , but maybe this is a feature of matrix
Feb 10 13:55:07 <Lohyna>	akik thanks :)
Feb 10 13:55:27 <akik>	Lohyna: no problem!
Feb 10 13:56:09 <rustysysdev_>	AkA[m], Seems so! I like how it shows a preview of the message you are replying to in addition to the name! Neat!
Feb 10 14:00:57 <Lohyna>	Are you guys looking forward to gnome 40?
Feb 10 14:02:32 <stefanozannoni[m>	<Lohyna "Are you guys looking forward to "> yes, looking for it on fedora..

Feb 10 14:04:01 <rustysysdev_>	I haven't been using Gnome, I have been a MATE user for the past 6~7 years.  That being said, I am looking forward to trying it out!
Feb 10 14:04:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	Lohyna, to be truthful, as long as it works most people will be happy
Feb 10 14:05:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	AkA[m], remember do not quote in the matrix it makes a mess on other platforms

Feb 10 14:25:09 <rustysysdev_>	Speaking of which,,, Does anyone have experiance with kickstart? I am having an issue with setting up the network configuration with my wifi settings
Feb 10 14:25:23 <rustysysdev_>	Anyone know if its possible?
Feb 10 14:26:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	rustysysdev_, what are you trying to do
Feb 10 14:26:22 <Lohyna>	rustysysdev_, now i am stay on defaults of Gnome, just with some extentions as dock and stuff
Feb 10 14:26:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	is the wifi device supported
Feb 10 14:27:09 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, I am trying to get the kickstart file to configure wifi so that I can connect to the nearest mirror and download packages.
Feb 10 14:27:24 <rustysysdev_>	I have the following network command
Feb 10 14:27:25 <rustysysdev_>	`network --activate --device=wlp2s0 --essid=RUSTYSYSDEV_UQ_2G --wpakey=**********`
Feb 10 14:27:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	rustysysdev_, what iso are you booting
Feb 10 14:27:40 <rustysysdev_>	I am booting the network install for f33
Feb 10 14:27:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats why
Feb 10 14:28:15 <Lohyna>	rustysysdev_, never used it, sooo... sorry :)
Feb 10 14:28:31 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, I can't configure wifi on the network install?
Feb 10 14:28:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	networkinstall is basicly the server install which by default does not have wireless drivers
Feb 10 14:28:44 <rustysysdev_>	Lohyna, no problem! :D
Feb 10 14:30:38 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, So I should download the Workstation ISO? Will that allow me to choose packages like I would expect to be able to do so on the network installer?  I know the graphical interface doesn't allow much freedom in that regard.
Feb 10 14:31:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	maybe the workstation netboot might i have nt played with it, but i think it will be the same
Feb 10 14:31:47 <Khaytsus>	rustysysdev_: If you want more control over what you install, do the server iso.  But you probably want a spin and go from there for _most_ users.
Feb 10 14:31:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	might ^
Feb 10 14:32:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	Khaytsus,  no wireless in the server iso
Feb 10 14:32:10 <Khaytsus>	But all of hte spins are preconfigured with their _default_ pacakges.  But Fedora is Fedora regardless of spin.
Feb 10 14:32:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	that their probelm
Feb 10 14:32:17 <Khaytsus>	No....   wireless?  Alrighty.
Feb 10 14:32:23 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, Also with the network installer I can manually setup my wifi if I enter the graphical installer without kickstart
Feb 10 14:33:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	rustysysdev_,  or you can run a ethernet cable and be done
Feb 10 14:33:43 <rustysysdev_>	It also seems to recognize the wifi card, but I `just` noticed this in the logs...
Feb 10 14:33:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	or build a iso with everything you need
Feb 10 14:33:56 <rustysysdev_>	https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/f7fa0246dd90e3b4c115a4b2c6e3549acd13660f/pyanaconda/modules/network/initialization.py#L90
Feb 10 14:35:48 <rustysysdev_>	I'll probably just end up using an ethernet cable, but It would have been great to see the wifi working here... :P
Feb 10 14:35:58 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, Thanks
Feb 10 14:36:25 <Khaytsus>	Wifi works perfectly fine, but...  I guess the server iso doesn't have something in it.  I wasn't aware of that.
Feb 10 14:37:14 <rustysysdev_>	Khaytsus, WiFi works great for me too until I try to use it inside of kickstart.
Feb 10 14:37:54 <rustysysdev_>	Works properly on the same ISO when installed manually
Feb 10 14:41:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	rustysysdev_, so do a manual install and copy the ks out of the /root
Feb 10 14:43:45 <rustysysdev_>	Southern_Gentlem, I did that for my initial ks.cfg but the wifi settings were not reflected there.  Looking at it more closely I don't think that kickstar supports WiFi configuration (although it has it in the docs)
Feb 10 14:44:01 <rustysysdev_>	seems to find the wireless interfaces and manually skip them
Feb 10 14:44:01 <rustysysdev_>	https://github.com/rhinstaller/anaconda/blob/f7fa0246dd90e3b4c115a4b2c6e3549acd13660f/pyanaconda/modules/network/initialization.py#L87-L91

Feb 10 15:40:35 <Mr_Ecko>	s/keyboard/keyboard shortcut/
Feb 10 15:40:57 <Lohyna>	Just wondering why irc chats are so outdated in UI terms. I know that irc does not need all effects and stuff but still
Feb 10 15:41:57 <VinAlencc404>	Lohyna, like what?
Feb 10 15:42:08 <akik>	Lohyna: because the point of the chat is chat, not bells and whistles
Feb 10 15:42:17 <foomf>	I've always kind of wondered that too. Like, why IRC hasn't changed in like... 20 years lol
Feb 10 15:42:53 <gnafu>	I think it's infinitely more accessible than something that promotes the use of emoji and animated GIFs.
Feb 10 15:43:11 <Lohyna>	foomf, ahahhahahh
Feb 10 15:43:17 <gnafu>	Plain text communication is an important thing to have available.
Feb 10 15:43:25 <VinAlencc404>	gnafu, I agree with you
Feb 10 15:44:37 <Lohyna>	IRC is very flexible, so why not have beautiful client :)
Feb 10 15:44:59 <foomf>	I actually think hexchat looks fine
Feb 10 15:45:14 <foomf>	at least on my system/desktop environment. On windows hexchat looks like its from windows 95 though lol
Feb 10 15:45:25 <gnafu>	Hehe.
Feb 10 15:45:33 <foomf>	but that's often the case for multiplatform apps that use native gui toolkits for each platform
Feb 10 15:45:34 <gnafu>	But yeah, there are several GUI IRC clients.
Feb 10 15:45:41 <gnafu>	And browser-based ones.
Feb 10 15:46:13 <gnafu>	I used Trillian for IRC a looong time ago (but not freenode).
Feb 10 15:46:24 <coz_>	you can theme hexchat, though I am not sure this has to do with fedora specifically
Feb 10 15:46:30 <Lohyna>	gnafu, yeah, found some with fine ui like Srain and Polari
Feb 10 15:47:01 <gnafu>	I like how I can just leave Irssi-in-tmux running on my server and have logs of what I missed while I was away.
Feb 10 15:48:56 <Lohyna>	gnafu, ohh, i'd like to learn how to use weechat, i know that's not so hard but still
Feb 10 15:49:22 <Lohyna>	It's just cool to chat in terminal
Feb 10 15:50:00 <Lohyna>	but i suppose not so comfortable

Feb 10 15:52:22 <coz_>	foomf, cool %) now you can try #fedora-social
Feb 10 15:52:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	chi chat in here is fine until someone has a #fedora issue they want help with
Feb 10 15:53:04 <coz_>	Southern_Gentlem, sounds reasonable
Feb 10 15:53:25 <coz_>	my cat sheds alot
Feb 10 15:53:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	the channel stays idle 70% of the time
Feb 10 15:53:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz well lets keep it to linux/application related
Feb 10 15:54:24 <coz_>	Southern_Gentlem,  ah ok, lol,
Feb 10 15:54:27 <foomf>	I kind of have a vague linux question. I've heard this term "ricing" before when it comes to linux desktops, but I have no idea what it means. Does anyone here know?
Feb 10 15:55:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	not to desktops
Feb 10 15:56:04 <gnafu>	foomf: It comes from people doing little, mostly cosmetic modifications to Japanese cars thinking they're getting big performance boosts.
Feb 10 15:56:08 <coz_>	foomf, I believe it means changing themes, icons, etc to your liking and fedora MATE is especially keen for that
Feb 10 15:56:18 <gnafu>	And then people doing similar things with compilers, like tiny tweaks for their hardware.
Feb 10 15:56:37 <gnafu>	Putting in more effort customizing than you get out of it.
Feb 10 15:57:06 <gnafu>	The origin of the term is potentially offensive, referring to things like Honda Civics as "rice burners".
Feb 10 15:57:13 <gnafu>	( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_burner )
Feb 10 15:57:18 <foomf>	ah I think I understand, thanks!
Feb 10 15:57:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	and linux easily out performs M$ on the same hardware
Feb 10 15:57:44 <coz_>	^^^^^^
Feb 10 15:58:27 <foomf>	now if only linux could run all the stuff M$ could ;;
Feb 10 15:59:09 *	lohyna is now known as Lohyna
Feb 10 15:59:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, like
Feb 10 15:59:25 *	Lohyna is now known as Lolkamui
Feb 10 15:59:42 *	Lolkamui is now known as Lohyna
Feb 10 15:59:45 <foomf>	are you asking me what doesn't run on linux?
Feb 10 16:00:16 <Mr_Ecko>	Games :)
Feb 10 16:00:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am asking to clarify your earlier statement
Feb 10 16:00:22 <gnafu>	Wine has gotten pretty good for some things.  Also, Microsoft provides developer VM images of Windows 10 you could run in virt-manager if you needed.
Feb 10 16:00:29 <Lohyna>	Mr_Ecko: that's a good one
Feb 10 16:00:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	steam has came a long way on the games side
Feb 10 16:01:15 <Lohyna>	Mr_Ecko: but honesty i can play now preaty good with wine and proton
Feb 10 16:01:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	the only thing i use windows for now, is to do my taxes, and do Amateur Radio testing sessions
Feb 10 16:01:40 <Mr_Ecko>	Yeah, it was meant as a joke. A lot of games do run now
Feb 10 16:01:51 <Mr_Ecko>	And Valve is actively trying to get more to run on Linux too
Feb 10 16:01:55 <Mr_Ecko>	It's all great
Feb 10 16:02:00 <foomf>	oh. I have a plex media server and while the client does kind of work in the web browser, its not as polished. Music playback likes to randomly stop. There's a plex media player for linux I cound, but its suuuper bare bones and doesn't do much. I also have a tidal music subscription but I haven't found a way to get it working on linux.
Feb 10 16:02:32 <Lohyna>	Southern_Gentlem: i need Windows for college, so dualboot with fedora(
Feb 10 16:03:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	tbh in 5 years i suspect M$ will be a DE in linux
Feb 10 16:04:05 *	Southern_Gentlem $dayjob is Windows Admin at a Uni
Feb 10 16:04:28 <foomf>	Southern_Gentlem: I doubt that. Too much legacy software on windows. One of windows' biggest selling points is its backwards compatibility. There's too much legacy software in the enterprise space for M$ to do something like that.
Feb 10 16:07:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, time will tell
Feb 10 16:07:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	all the software my people need runs on window,linux and OSx
Feb 10 16:08:36 <foomf>	also slightly related to fedora, how did this person get their gnome to look like this? https://imgur.com/A4Sbgkh
Feb 10 16:09:40 <zuvy>	foomf: looks like the gnome extension Dash to Panel
Feb 10 16:10:32 <foomf>	zuvy: thanks!
Feb 10 16:12:42 <foomf>	maaan now I wish I could get more into customizing my linux
Feb 10 16:13:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, you can
Feb 10 16:13:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	but what is the real gain in the long run
Feb 10 16:13:49 <foomf>	I don't think I can. I don't know enough about how anything works, I'll probably just break something
Feb 10 16:14:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, thats what VM are for
Feb 10 16:14:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	so you can get in their and play
Feb 10 16:14:22 <Southern_Gentlem>	there rather
Feb 10 16:14:32 <coz_>	ease of use, creating a personal work flow
Feb 10 16:14:42 <foomf>	well also my system is working pretty well and you know what they say, don't fix what's not broken
Feb 10 16:14:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	thus a VM
Feb 10 16:15:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	fedora has great virtualization
Feb 10 16:15:35 <foomf>	I also feel really bad downloading packages from the repositories. They're hosting it for freee and here I am stealing bandwidth so I can experiment with things
Feb 10 16:15:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	they are ok with that
Feb 10 16:16:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, they know its open source and they support by being mirrors
Feb 10 16:16:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	you can setup a local mirror of your own if you want it
Feb 10 16:17:28 <foomf>	could that mirror be smart enough to only download packages as they're requested, or would it have to do a full download of every package under the sun?
Feb 10 16:17:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	they rsync daily
Feb 10 16:18:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	ok if you look at the fedora repos there are releases and updates
Feb 10 16:18:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	releases they pull once per release
Feb 10 16:18:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	updates change daily so thats the only thing they update daily
Feb 10 16:19:23 <Southern_Gentlem>	my local mirror i update daily and carry it home and update my machine there
Feb 10 16:20:51 <coz_>	foomf, out of curiosity, how new to linux are you? and congratulation for choosing fedora
Feb 10 16:21:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	i build updated respins daily so i use my personal mirror to do those so i am not downloading the same packages 8-9x
Feb 10 16:22:05 <foomf>	I'm actually not -that- new. My first fedora was 16. The vast majority of my linux experience is with servers and docker containers though. Headless stuff. I have a lot less experience when it comes to running linux on a desktop with desktop environments, window managers, etc etc
Feb 10 16:22:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, so a DE like xfce or LXDE maybe better for you than like gnome
Feb 10 16:23:19 <foomf>	I've almost always used xfce
Feb 10 16:23:22 <foomf>	right now I'm on cinnamon
Feb 10 16:23:25 <coz_>	or MATE not to keep repeating %)
Feb 10 16:24:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	the only thing i like about gnome is i can actually do everything and not take my hands off the keyboard
Feb 10 16:24:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	but i have a longer list of things about gnome that i dont like
Feb 10 16:25:10 <coz_>	I agree
Feb 10 16:25:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	mainly lost of freedom
Feb 10 16:25:39 <coz_>	which is why I prefer MATE,
Feb 10 16:25:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	i do as well
Feb 10 16:26:27 <coz_>	%)
Feb 10 16:26:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	that is what i like about Fedora we have lots of freedom to try different things and its still fedora
Feb 10 16:26:52 <coz_>	and with all that its near flawless stability
Feb 10 16:27:53 <foomf>	the thing that worries me the most is I'm not familiar with how x11 works, all the config files needed, etc. From what I understand you could install a minimal/headless fedora and then manually install the desktop environment of your choice, but I was warned it "wouldn't be the same" and I don't really know what that means so I'm just afraid to touch things/stray outside the sanctioned flow of installing destkop environments lol
Feb 10 16:28:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, so build vm and play
Feb 10 16:28:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, sudo fpaste --sysinfo
Feb 10 16:30:17 <foomf>	Southern_Gentlem: https://paste.centos.org/view/2ebf6e17
Feb 10 16:31:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	your processor supports virtualization and you have plenty of ram set up a testing environment and play
Feb 10 16:32:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats how you learn and lot of those things about X you really dont have to mess with
Feb 10 16:32:40 <coz_>	I agree! play untill you find the "work flow" that suits you
Feb 10 16:32:54 <Southern_Gentlem>	google is your friend
Feb 10 16:34:39 <foomf>	I usually have pretty bad luck virtualizing things but maybe it'll work better under linux or something
Feb 10 16:36:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf take a look at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/
Feb 10 16:36:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	yes its native to fedora
Feb 10 16:37:35 <foomf>	I don't know if I have the storage space for virtualization
Feb 10 16:37:54 <foomf>	admittedly.... my storage situation is all sorts of messed up, the anaconda installer did weird things I don't understand
Feb 10 16:38:00 <foomf>	so I can't access most of my ssd
Feb 10 16:40:05 <coz_>	foomf, prior to install did you tick the box for making more room on the drive?
Feb 10 16:40:28 <foomf>	it was actually a fresh drive from amazon, nothing on it beforehand
Feb 10 16:40:35 <coz_>	OH!
Feb 10 16:41:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, go it an external usb and have fun
Feb 10 16:41:18 <foomf>	Southern_Gentlem: I don't understand
Feb 10 16:41:56 <coz_>	I think he meant a live usb??
Feb 10 16:42:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	no an external usb hardrive
Feb 10 16:42:22 <coz_>	ah yes that is also good
Feb 10 16:42:53 <coz_>	I use an external for fedora gnome/wayfire
Feb 10 16:43:22 <foomf>	I got around whatever the anaconda installer did by resizing a partition and then manually mounting it in that one file
Feb 10 16:43:27 <foomf>	procfs?
Feb 10 16:43:52 <foomf>	the anaconda made this huuuuge partition that's the vast majority of the storage, but I don't know where it is. It's not mounted to anything
Feb 10 16:44:17 *	coz_ is perplexed
Feb 10 16:44:20 <foomf>	in my paste I sent: https://paste.centos.org/view/2ebf6e17 you can see it on line 91
Feb 10 16:44:48 <foomf>	I have no idea what that thing is, but in gparted it shows as being a huge partition that's hundreds of gb large. Even though in df it shows up pretty tiny
Feb 10 16:47:38 <Mr_Ecko>	I've set up a keyboard shortcut to open Terminal with the "super + 2" key combination. However when I type that combination it opens the gnome calendar. What gives?
Feb 10 16:48:00 <foomf>	this is what my gparted looks like: https://imgur.com/a/uyluXDj I resized /dev/sda3 to 60gb since I don't know where that space even goes anyways. That /dev/sda3 partition used to be "the rest of the drive", so about 200gb (its a 250gb drive). I shrunk the partition down to the size it is now. Made another partition (/dev/sda4) which I mounted manually in procfs, and then that unallocated space I'm saving for later. Do you guys know what is up with that
Feb 10 16:48:00 <foomf>	/dev/sda3?
Feb 10 16:48:04 <Mr_Ecko>	Same goes with Super + 3
Feb 10 16:50:42 <foomf>	Apparently my / root only has 3gb remaining. What anaconda did with the other 200gb of my ssd eludes me.
Feb 10 16:51:29 <foomf>	there's not even a / mount point in gparted though so I just don't know how any of this works
Feb 10 16:51:42 <coz_>	foomf, I was under the impression that fedora now defaulted to btrfs
Feb 10 16:52:13 <foomf>	there was a dropdown menu for the partition and I chose xfs
Feb 10 16:52:23 <foomf>	I don't remember why
Feb 10 16:52:37 <foomf>	is that what caused all this to go wrong?
Feb 10 16:53:50 <coz_>	foomf, not sure, let me upload an image of my gparted, hold on
Feb 10 16:54:37 <Terminus>	yep, that looks like partitioning gone wrong.
Feb 10 16:55:39 <coz_>	foomf,   https://ibb.co/xJ9G3wB
Feb 10 16:55:52 <Terminus>	foomf: what does your `sudo lvs` look like?
Feb 10 16:56:03 <foomf>	coz_ that's what I'm used to partition stuff looking like, that's what I expected to see
Feb 10 16:56:36 <pdkl>	question on fedora rawhide, i installed it, is it a rolling update type of thing?
Feb 10 16:56:43 <Terminus>	it looks like you have some unallocated space in your LVM.

Feb 10 17:01:03 <pdkl>	i have client source code from the late 1990s still in my home dir
Feb 10 17:01:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	and hopefully you have it backed up
Feb 10 17:01:28 <pdkl>	not sure if it compiles, you never know who calls up "hey... can you update.. x feature.."
Feb 10 17:01:46 <pdkl>	yes its backed up and encrypted, per contract agreements
Feb 10 17:01:58 <pdkl>	why it takes hours its decrypting it
Feb 10 17:02:10 <foomf>	Terminus: What's a "PV"? And what do you mean by allocated? It says its size is 60gb but 15gb oare useable. At least, in gparted. In df it says only 15 is allocated... oh I guess that's what you mean.
Feb 10 17:02:38 <Terminus>	foomf: PV == LVM physical volume which is what your sda3 is.
Feb 10 17:02:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, by default / on a server install is 15G
Feb 10 17:02:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	so yes you need to enlarge it
Feb 10 17:03:17 <foomf>	oh. I did use the server installer yeah. The web installer thing
Feb 10 17:03:20 <pdkl>	speaking of fedora, first fedora i used was fedora core 4(?)
Feb 10 17:03:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	pdkl,  rookie
Feb 10 17:03:33 <Terminus>	foomf: if your only problem is the fact that you only have 3 GB left on your root volume, you'll need to resize the LV (logical volume) followed by resizing the filesystem.
Feb 10 17:03:39 <pdkl>	lol, i used slackware before that.
Feb 10 17:03:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	rhl4.2
Feb 10 17:04:05 <pdkl>	what a wonderful experience this linux world has become
Feb 10 17:04:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	yeah
Feb 10 17:04:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	and the kernel has come a long way
Feb 10 17:04:25 <pdkl>	now ever microsoft edge runs on linux.
Feb 10 17:04:37 <Terminus>	haha. i remember the days of compiling an emu10k1 driver because it wasn't mainline and it's kinda nice to have sound.
Feb 10 17:04:40 <pdkl>	microsoft-edge-dev-90.0.789.1-1.x86_64.
Feb 10 17:04:41 <foomf>	Terminus: how do I expand my root volume? I don't know what partition to expand.
Feb 10 17:04:42 <akik>	pdkl: and linux runs on windows as wsl 2 :)
Feb 10 17:04:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	well its chromium based now
Feb 10 17:05:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, google that
Feb 10 17:05:17 <pdkl>	code is the most used editor for developers now.. a MS product.. and main stream developers use fedora/ubuntu, and MS code
Feb 10 17:05:31 <Terminus>	foomf: https://linux.die.net/man/8/lvresize
Feb 10 17:05:46 <_val_>	What happened to certwatch in F32?
Feb 10 17:05:50 <pdkl>	Mozilla is now a Rust compilier company.   I started out on watcom C++ for DOS and OS/2
Feb 10 17:06:15 <pdkl>	Watcom.. what a discovery it was.
Feb 10 17:06:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, question do you hva backups ?
Feb 10 17:06:50 <foomf>	Southern_Gentlem: I don't know what an hva backup is
Feb 10 17:07:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	foomf, do you have a backup of your data
Feb 10 17:07:50 <foomf>	yeah
Feb 10 17:08:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	reinstall
Feb 10 17:08:07 <foomf>	well, no. But I don't have any data on this computer, I just intalled it a couple days ago lol
Feb 10 17:08:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	reinstall
Feb 10 17:08:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	and be done and remember to make your / at least 50G
Feb 10 17:09:22 <Terminus>	yeah, having a backup is optimum because i would go for the reinstall option as well. either that or move sda4 into an LV and get rid of sda4.
Feb 10 17:09:32 <pdkl>	oh yes.. RH 4.2 how interesting
Feb 10 17:09:50 <matteo>	$ rpm -q microsoft-edge-dev
Feb 10 17:09:51 <matteo>	microsoft-edge-dev-88.0.673.0-1.x86_64
Feb 10 17:10:13 <pdkl>	apparently it just updated
Feb 10 17:10:18 <Terminus>	personally, i kickstart my installs to make sure that the partitions are exactly as i want it.
Feb 10 17:10:53 <foomf>	alright, I guess I'm uninstalling. Thanks everyone, I'll talk to you all later! Might even try out mate as well.
Feb 10 17:11:06 <pdkl>	Fedora Core inspired me to get my RHCE, i got it twice, and just recently let it expire
Feb 10 17:11:41 <pdkl>	what i liked about the RHCE exam... you had to know how to do things.
Feb 10 17:12:00 <Terminus>	pdkl: watcom for the good old dos/4gw? took me a while to remember that one. =D
Feb 10 17:12:15 <matteo>	$ rpm -q powershell
Feb 10 17:12:15 <matteo>	powershell-7.0.3-1.rhel.7.x86_64
Feb 10 17:12:19 <matteo>	:)
Feb 10 17:12:47 <pdkl>	Terminus, yes exactly, i wrote some uart serial terminal for a 911 system decades ago using watcom's stl
Feb 10 17:13:33 <pdkl>	it had to be fast, they had 5 contractors all trying to get the contract, paid all of us for a "demo" , i came out on top cause I used stl
Feb 10 17:13:49 <Terminus>	i knew watcom was popular for dos/4gw but i stayed in borland territory througout the 90s. turbo c++ was good enough for me. i didn't know what i was doing anyway. i still don't know what i'm doing. hah.
Feb 10 17:14:04 <pdkl>	core issue was simple it had to route 9-11 calls for major metros to a mainframe system.
Feb 10 17:14:16 <pdkl>	turbo c++ is still glorious
Feb 10 17:14:29 <Terminus>	pdkl: well, that must have been fun. uart interface to the PBX?
Feb 10 17:14:47 <pdkl>	the interface was a custom mainframe app
Feb 10 17:15:23 <pdkl>	mix between modem commands (ATT ATD1111 etc) and weird symbols
Feb 10 17:15:42 <Terminus>	so you just had to signal the mainfram how to route the calls and it would do the rest?
Feb 10 17:15:44 <pdkl>	a drunk mainframe programmer had to write it.
Feb 10 17:16:10 <pdkl>	passed persons information for the call to the person's dos terminal
Feb 10 17:16:18 <Terminus>	ah... gotcha.
Feb 10 17:16:37 <pdkl>	it was win31 interface if i recall, but it was a win drv
Feb 10 17:16:48 <pdkl>	or com ? something. been decades
Feb 10 17:16:58 <Terminus>	since we're on the topic of compiling stuff, i just did a clean on a project i'm writing right now. it's nowhere near done and it's still building. LOL
Feb 10 17:17:27 <pdkl>	just got done with a dart/flutter project
Feb 10 17:17:56 <pdkl>	thinking about rewritting a slow part in rust
Feb 10 17:17:58 <Terminus>	aha! took 1 minute 50 seconds to compile LOL. can't believe how much time compiling takes nowadays.
Feb 10 17:18:14 <pdkl>	LOL, you remember those days of "recompile, going to lunch"
Feb 10 17:18:14 <pdkl>	?
Feb 10 17:18:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	recompile take the rest of the day/week off
Feb 10 17:18:52 <Terminus>	ah... never did those. never went into a programming career. system administration is much easier so i went that route. XD
Feb 10 17:19:19 <pdkl>	I was a developer, turned devops. turned do whatever i want.
Feb 10 17:19:23 <Terminus>	right now though i'm doing all kinds of silly stuff with websockets in c++.
Feb 10 17:19:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	pdkl, that was rhl 4.2 not rhel
Feb 10 17:19:41 <pdkl>	pardon me :D
Feb 10 17:20:12 <Terminus>	and i'm here chatting instead of writing code because i just realized i'll have to restructure my messaging system and i'm procrastinating. XD
Feb 10 17:22:05 <pdkl>	Gnome 4.0 looks nice, they done a great job
Feb 10 17:26:25 <Terminus>	wayland has been freezing on me on vmware. still haven't filed a bug report on that. >_<
Feb 10 17:27:54 <pdkl>	i had to set something to fix that
Feb 10 17:28:20 <Terminus>	pdkl: oh, you've had the same problem? i just disabled wayland and went back to xorg.
Feb 10 17:28:37 <pdkl>	[resolutionKMS] enable=true
Feb 10 17:29:03 <pdkl>	in the /etc/vmware-tools/tools.conf
Feb 10 17:29:09 <Terminus>	also, was wondering if it's somehow a side effect of me forcing EFI on fedora even though you can't select it in the GUI.
Feb 10 17:29:34 <Terminus>	pdkl: oh, that's for resizing. i have that. the freezing is a separate problem.
Feb 10 17:30:00 <pdkl>	interesting, then what fixed it
Feb 10 17:30:50 <Terminus>	no idea. the one difference i can think of that i bet most people don't do is forcing EFI in the vmx file.
Feb 10 17:31:10 <Terminus>	i just found it silly that vmware prohibits me from using EFI for fedora in the GUI.
Feb 10 17:31:34 <pdkl>	what do you use for a hypervisor host?
Feb 10 17:32:01 <Terminus>	i have WaylandEnable=false in /etc/gdm/custom.conf just so that i don't have to figure it out.
Feb 10 17:32:20 <Terminus>	pdkl: it's vmware workstation 16 on win10 20H1.
Feb 10 17:32:41 <pdkl>	same.
Feb 10 17:32:55 <pdkl>	thus the recent re-install of my workstation
Feb 10 17:33:37 <Terminus>	maybe some weird nvidia driver thing. i'm on an old GPU. GTX 960 which i bet is tested rarely nowadays.
Feb 10 17:34:00 <pdkl>	understand that.
Feb 10 17:34:30 <pdkl>	linux plays games, but I wanted it to play native windows games.
Feb 10 17:34:40 <Terminus>	i originally had centos but the recent changes to it broke my install. VDO related. decided to just go fedora. my laptop is RHEL 8 on bare metal though.
Feb 10 17:34:55 <pdkl>	to be blunt, linux works great, i question why i switched hosts.
Feb 10 17:35:05 <Terminus>	same. i'm not gonna bother with running windows stuff on linux. i'll run windows stuff on windows which is why my desktop is windows.
Feb 10 17:35:25 <pdkl>	i use vmware-kvm to boot my workstations up
Feb 10 17:35:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	run libvirt and orget vbox/vmware
Feb 10 17:35:59 <pdkl>	vmware-kvm is the sole reason why i use vmware workstation 16
Feb 10 17:36:24 <pdkl>	https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2057914
Feb 10 17:36:39 <Terminus>	i just run one VM most of the time. don't need anything fancy. most things i care about can be done in containers nowadays.
Feb 10 17:36:55 <IPFreely>	why support windows. microsoft is wrong on so many levels. boycott that shit
Feb 10 17:37:09 <matteo>	nope
Feb 10 17:37:13 <pdkl>	if you compile rust code... use the apple m1 chip
Feb 10 17:37:16 <pdkl>	its lovely.
Feb 10 17:37:24 <matteo>	I don't boycott anything, I just support Linux
Feb 10 17:37:27 <Terminus>	in fact, the build system for the c++ code i'm writing runs in an F33 container. portable between my fedora VM and RHEL laptop.
Feb 10 17:37:49 <matteo>	and if I have a powershell tool to run, I prefer a linux version than rebooting
Feb 10 17:38:33 <pdkl>	MS has made great efforts in supporting open platforms. one must give credit.
Feb 10 17:38:54 <pdkl>	its the owners of MS is the ones I do not trust.
Feb 10 17:44:18 <matteo>	pdkl: the owners?
Feb 10 17:46:15 <dmlloyd>	what's a good minimal graphical text editor included in fedora these days?  one which doesn't die if you give it emoji/variable length characters/right-to-left etc.
Feb 10 17:47:27 <dmlloyd>	been using gedit but there must be something cooler than that :)
Feb 10 17:49:02 <IPFreely>	Is Wind10 supposed to be free now? If so, huge red flag.
Feb 10 17:49:47 <Khaytsus>	I used gedit a little in the past but gnome ruined it some years back
Feb 10 17:50:47 <Khaytsus>	I thought atom was in Fedora, I must be missing something
Feb 10 17:51:39 <Khaytsus>	That said; atom used to be so slow it was unusable for me.
Feb 10 17:55:24 <matteo>	dmlloyd: I'm fine with Kate
Feb 10 17:56:52 <dmlloyd>	huh, not bad
Feb 10 17:56:59 <dmlloyd>	the scroll bar thingy is neat
Feb 10 17:57:06 <cberg>	IPFreely: win10 isn't free. but they've removed the time limit for unregistered versions. you still get some reduced customizing functionality and an annoying watermark after a while
Feb 10 18:04:13 <dbristow>	Khaytsus: Emacs!  :)
Feb 10 18:07:14 <gnafu>	cberg, IPFreely: Also, they offer developer VMs that have expiration dates: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
Feb 10 18:07:38 <gnafu>	It's huge, but it works great in Boxes and virt-manager (if you download and import the VirtualBox .ova).
Feb 10 18:09:54 <Khaytsus>	dbristow: uh well,..  I guess.
Feb 10 18:10:14 <Khaytsus>	Problem with Kate is pulling in 55 gigs of KDE stuff
Feb 10 18:11:20 <linuxmodder>	55G ? that might be a slight overstatement but not by much Khaytsus
Feb 10 18:11:38 <Khaytsus>	52?
Feb 10 18:11:40 <Khaytsus>	;)
Feb 10 18:11:55 <linuxmodder>	more like 15G download and 50G on disk
Feb 10 18:11:57 <linuxmodder>	:P
Feb 10 19:01:46 <mohab[m]>	So I '$dnf versionlock add [package]' then I '$dnf versionlock list' and the package is added alright, with exact version I want, but it still updates with the system anyway. Does versionlock even work, or am I doing something wrong?
Feb 10 19:03:38 <mohab[m]>	https://dnf-plugins-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/versionlock.html
Feb 10 19:06:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	if you want version locking you can use the modularity repos or you can set a exclude in your update.repo
Feb 10 19:12:37 <jberkus>	hey, I'm transferring all my stuff from one laptop to another.  Where are OpenVPN config and cert files stored as of Fedora 30?
Feb 10 19:17:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	usually in your /home
Feb 10 19:20:19 <jberkus>	where specifically?  grep -r vpn turns up nothing
Feb 10 19:20:48 <jberkus>	fedora wiki says look in /etc/NetworkManager or /etc/openvpn, but those are empty
Feb 10 19:24:53 <afinkel>	jberkus: check in ~/.pki and /etc/pki for certs
Feb 10 19:25:22 <jberkus>	there we go, thanks!
Feb 10 19:25:30 <afinkel>	cool
Feb 10 19:25:54 <jberkus>	apparently there are a lot of different places your vpn config can live
Feb 10 19:26:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	also rpm -ql openvpn
Feb 10 19:26:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	also rpm -ql networkmanager-openvpn
Feb 10 19:29:33 <jberkus>	wow, /etc/dbus-1 ????!??!
Feb 10 19:34:19 <akik>	so many ways to skin a cat
Feb 10 19:34:46 <jberkus>	gah, never mind, looks like file config changed between 30 and 34
Feb 10 19:34:53 <jberkus>	can't just copy
Feb 10 19:36:32 <akik>	i was looking for the flathub zoom client startup file. found it from the following path: /var/lib/flatpak/app/us.zoom.Zoom/current/active/export/share/applications :)
Feb 10 19:40:53 <jberkus>	yeah, flatpaks make paths a little wonky
Feb 10 19:48:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	zoom updates so much that i just use the rpm
Feb 10 19:52:45 <jberkus>	I'm on silverblue, so flatpak it is
Feb 10 19:56:41 <dowdle>	 (because Fedora updates are so hard (not))
Feb 10 19:57:34 <jberkus>	?
Feb 10 20:10:48 <akik>	the flathub zoom client was quite huge, about 800 megs
Feb 10 20:17:02 <elmiko>	hey fedora folks, i've just installed f33 server and after i reboot i am unable to reach any network address outside my router. i confirmed that i am able to get good dns results, but it just seems to fail with "Network is unreachable" when i try to ping something.
Feb 10 20:17:08 <elmiko>	any advice or pointers here?
Feb 10 20:19:26 <Southern_Gentlem>	so how are you getting dns
Feb 10 20:20:42 <elmiko>	i presume systemd-resolved is delivering it
Feb 10 20:20:57 <elmiko>	oh, i also run a dns server inside my local subnet
Feb 10 20:22:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	so check your settings to see what dns server the server is using i suspect it may or maynot be getting so you can also hard code
Feb 10 20:22:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	elmiko, its the server ip dhcp from the routor
Feb 10 20:22:50 <elmiko>	yeah, it's definitely acting weird. i can see it resolving things in a different manner than i would expect.
Feb 10 20:23:42 <elmiko>	i set the dns server in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
Feb 10 20:24:27 <elmiko>	but if i run `ping 8.8.8.8` i get "Network unreachable"
Feb 10 20:24:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	restart the network?
Feb 10 20:25:12 <elmiko>	i tried, no effect
Feb 10 20:25:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	kill resolve and do it the old way
Feb 10 20:25:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	start the network service
Feb 10 20:26:02 <watkinsr>	should I be moving from rawhide to fedora34 for the latest? I noticed rawhide stopped on feb08?
Feb 10 20:26:10 <elmiko>	Southern_Gentlem: ack, i'll give it a shot
Feb 10 20:27:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	watkinsr, no f34 branched from rawhide yesterday
Feb 10 20:28:12 <watkinsr>	Southern_Gentlem: wouldn't that make f34 the new upstream?
Feb 10 20:28:25 <Southern_Gentlem>	watkinsr,  up to that point rawhide was f34
Feb 10 20:28:31 <watkinsr>	oh ok
Feb 10 20:28:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	now rawhide is f35
Feb 10 20:28:44 <watkinsr>	oh, now i get it :D
Feb 10 20:28:49 <watkinsr>	thanks
Feb 10 20:28:49 <Terminus>	elmiko: sounds like a routing problem. if pinging 8.8.8.8 doesn't work, there's nothing to resolve there.
Feb 10 20:30:01 <elmiko>	Terminus: yeah, i just don't get it
Feb 10 20:30:43 <Terminus>	elmiko: what's the output of `ip route`?
Feb 10 20:31:24 <elmiko>	1sec
Feb 10 20:31:35 <elmiko>	10.0.1.0/24 dev enp44s0u1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.1.114 metric 100
Feb 10 20:31:52 <Terminus>	elmiko: just that? sounds like you don't have a default gateway.
Feb 10 20:32:41 <elmiko>	i'm surprised dhcp didn't give that, but good thought
Feb 10 20:33:31 <Terminus>	elmiko: yeah, there's something going on with your network. whether it's the router or fedora that's the problem, no idea.
Feb 10 20:34:03 <Terminus>	i'm on F33 myself and i get everything from DHCP and SLAAC. worked the first time.
Feb 10 20:34:35 <elmiko>	i imagine it's something with my net equipment as i haven't hit this fedora33 before
Feb 10 20:35:18 <Terminus>	the kludge would be to just add a route.
Feb 10 20:35:35 <elmiko>	yeah, i'm gonna do that in short term ;)
Feb 10 20:35:41 <elmiko>	thanks for talking it through with me
Feb 10 20:36:24 <Terminus>	elmiko: you'll probably want to get familiar with nmcli if you're not already. i do all the networking stuff through that nowadays. you'll want ipv4.gateway in nmcli.
Feb 10 20:37:22 <dowdle>	elmiko: If you are on more than one network, make sure the interfaces that aren't your route to the Internet have some checkbox to NOT use that interface for default routing.... or something like that.
Feb 10 20:37:32 <ppavacic>	hello, im following this tutorial
Feb 10 20:37:35 <ppavacic>	https://gist.github.com/da-n/4c77d09720f3e5989dd0f6de5fe3cbfb
Feb 10 20:38:13 <ppavacic>	and  I'm stuck at step "Add the following line in the /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/cryptroot file."
Feb 10 20:38:13 <ppavacic>	I'm guessing initramfs-tools is ubuntu specific thing
Feb 10 20:38:17 <elmiko>	dowdle: ack, thank you!
Feb 10 20:38:21 <ppavacic>	so I wonder how can I do that on fedora?
Feb 10 20:38:30 <elmiko>	Terminus: i can always get more familiar with nmcli ;)
Feb 10 20:39:51 <ppavacic>	is initramfs-tools(ubuntu)=draut(fedora)
Feb 10 20:40:09 <ppavacic>	dracut*
Feb 10 20:40:52 <Terminus>	elmiko: yeah, gone are the days of editing files in /etc/sysconfig/. it's all NetworkManager now.
Feb 10 20:42:21 <elmiko>	Terminus: i'm generally cool with NM, i just don't remember all the options and whatnot
Feb 10 20:45:03 <genevino>	NM is awesome as long as you're prepared to actually debug what it's doing in behind manually.
Feb 10 20:47:07 <elmiko>	agreed genevino
Feb 10 20:48:15 <genevino>	i strongly disagree with it on any kind of static ip server setups, that's simply not right.
Feb 10 20:48:40 <genevino>	but for laptops? sure thing, i'll use that.
Feb 10 20:48:55 <elmiko>	i'm fairly certain this is just a screw up on my part
Feb 10 20:51:34 <Terminus>	yeah, the existence of NM doesn't mean you can skip knowing about iproute.
Feb 10 20:54:30 <Terminus>	i just think switching to whatever new way of doing things is better than trying to insist on doing it the old way. like lots of people moaned about systemd. i just started working on understanding systemd instead and completely forgot about sysvinit.
Feb 10 20:54:51 <elmiko>	i'm all for that, just trying to figure out what i screwed up lol
Feb 10 20:57:43 <dowdle>	genevino: On servers it is fine... especially when using nmcli or nmtui.  The reason it because it makes setting up all kinds of networking devices much easier... all in one too.  I haven't personally done anything fancy with it so I can't tell first hand that it is great at bonds, and everything else it handles... but it appears to be.
Feb 10 20:57:50 <ppavacic>	can anyone please tell me if I can get initramfs-tools on fedora
Feb 10 20:57:59 <dowdle>	(all in one tool)
Feb 10 20:59:42 <genevino>	dowdle: i strongly disagree with bloat on servers, so we can just agree to disagree here, NM has nothing to do on a server IMHO.
Feb 10 21:00:27 <genevino>	especially on static ip setups it's basically pointless anyways, so why bother with it?
Feb 10 21:02:28 <elmiko>	ok, so i think what happened here is that i manually added an ip address because the server in question kept getting an old cached value instead of the value i wanted from the dhcp server, and when i did that i failed to add the route. but, i guess my next question would be, is there an nmcli command to drop the dhcp cache?
Feb 10 21:03:05 <elmiko>	the nic in question kept ending up with both ip addresses (the cached and the new one)
Feb 10 21:05:08 <genevino>	elmiko: you could check if /var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases exists
Feb 10 21:05:09 <elmiko>	yup, that was it. boy do i feel foolish XD
Feb 10 21:05:24 <elmiko>	genevino: ack, thank you!
Feb 10 21:05:24 <Terminus>	elmiko: already done a `nmcli connection down foo && nmcli connection up foo`?
Feb 10 21:05:28 <genevino>	elmiko: :)
Feb 10 21:05:48 <elmiko>	Terminus: yeah, i did that before and it wasn't working, but i think enough time has passed now that it is properly acquring the address
Feb 10 21:07:58 <ppavacic>	I will try to ask again heh.
Feb 10 21:07:59 <ppavacic>	I am trying to set up paswordless luks encryption using usb key. I'm follwing some tutorial but I'm stuck at step where tutorial is using initramfs-tools which I believe isn't available on fedora.
Feb 10 21:08:04 <ppavacic>	Can anyone suggest me what to do
Feb 10 21:08:18 <ppavacic>	https://gist.github.com/da-n/4c77d09720f3e5989dd0f6de5fe3cbfb
Feb 10 21:08:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	ppavacic, you were told before that a ucraptu on fedora that would be dracut
Feb 10 21:09:01 <dowdle>	genevino: Why bother?  Because you might be configuring a whole host of advanced networking things that require a separate tool each... and THAT is where nm simplies it.  I don't know that NM is that much "bloat".
Feb 10 21:09:39 <dowdle>	genevino: But it is ok if YOU don't like it... but others who use more advanced features of it probably love it for how it simplified so much for them.
Feb 10 21:09:43 <genevino>	dowdle: that's not how problems reduction works. i generally start with the most simple thing and work my way up, not the other way around.
Feb 10 21:10:12 <genevino>	dowdle: i'm perfectly fine with it on a setup i have physical access to, but on a server i want zero surprises.
Feb 10 21:11:12 <genevino>	in fact one of the reasons why i heavily use netbsd and alpine for servers.
Feb 10 21:11:23 <dowdle>	genevino: The problem nm was trying to solve (in my opinion) was to have one tool to configure everything network related... and it was especially nightmarish when you work with a number of different distros.  Not only does nm solve it for one system, but all of the distros that use it (if setup properly).
Feb 10 21:11:48 <genevino>	dowdle: considering the "one tool to abandon all other tools" thing: https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png
Feb 10 21:11:49 <ppavacic>	Southern_Gentlem: sorry, I haven't seen anyone reply to me. Also what is  ucraptu
Feb 10 21:12:09 <dowdle>	genevino: The others may also still work, I have no idea... but having one swiss army knife.
Feb 10 21:12:39 <elmiko>	genevino: fwiw, i do have physical access to this specific server, but i get your point
Feb 10 21:12:45 <dowdle>	genevino: That would be true if you still continue to use the 14 other tools that are no longer necessary.
Feb 10 21:12:53 <genevino>	dowdle: it still *IS* nightmarish. i happen to have just written a wrapper script that circumvents dependency on the systemctl command. that's basically exactly the same thing. people trying to force a standard on you without realizing that reality differs.
Feb 10 21:13:11 <dowdle>	genevino: But so far as new standards go, I'm guessing nm didn't reinvent the backend of configuration, they just speak it... but I'm guessing.
Feb 10 21:13:13 <genevino>	dowdle: i'm a huge fan of diversity.
Feb 10 21:14:20 <genevino>	dowdle: https://unix.porn/fakesystemctl (WIP, beware!) - turns out to be actually useful in docker containers or for gnome extensions where developers consider init systems a mono-culture.
Feb 10 21:14:28 <Terminus>	*mumble* *mumble* firewalld...
Feb 10 21:14:28 <dowdle>	genevino: In those cases where one or more features don't work in a multi-purpose-tool... those things should be fixed.  There are always going to be bugs and shortcomings.
Feb 10 21:14:36 <ppavacic>	What is your guess, will just adding "CRYPTROOT=target=sda3_crypt,source=/dev/disk/by-uuid/[UUID]" work like it would with initramfs-tools to /etc/dracut.conf.d/cryptsetup.conf ?
Feb 10 21:14:53 <genevino>	dowdle: that's correct, but still doesn't justify the whole NM stack for a static ip setup.
Feb 10 21:15:19 <dowdle>	genevino: Yes, I do agree for a single wifi or wired setup, it is overkill.
Feb 10 21:15:42 <dowdle>	genevino: But overkill isn't so bad.  I mean, just how big is that "stack"?
Feb 10 21:15:51 <dowdle>	 (I don't know, which is why I ask)
Feb 10 21:15:56 <genevino>	dowdle: well for a wifi setup i'd say it's already solving so much problems you'd have doing it manually that i could agree with it. for a cable setup? not so.
Feb 10 21:16:22 <genevino>	dowdle: sure, it's still pretty okayish, and it's misbehaving almost never these days. but it wasn't like that 10 years ago.
Feb 10 21:16:47 <dowdle>	genevino: Supposedly Intel has a replacement for wpa_supplicant that is supposed to simplify wifi stuff... once it becomes mainstream.
Feb 10 21:17:00 <genevino>	dowdle: did you just say intel?
Feb 10 21:17:14 <genevino>	dowdle: that smells fishy.
Feb 10 21:17:25 <genevino>	dowdle: but we'll see how well it works i guess.
Feb 10 21:17:27 <dowdle>	genevino: Yeah.  It was in the mores recent or last issue of Linux Magazine Pro... let me see if I can find the name.
Feb 10 21:17:32 <genevino>	hehe

Feb 10 21:20:14 <genevino>	what? factor of 10!?
Feb 10 21:20:39 <genevino>	that's completely out of reach of what i expected.

Feb 11 17:34:29 <dalley>	if a deltaRPM exists in the repository for some package, the full package should always also be present, yes?
Feb 11 17:37:19 <linuxmodder>	dalley, what repo?
Feb 11 17:37:30 <linuxmodder>	and are you searching the drpms directory only
Feb 11 17:37:31 <dalley>	any fedora or EPEL repository generally
Feb 11 17:38:07 <linuxmodder>	the repo would yes unless its out of sync it should
Feb 11 17:46:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	dalley, yes
Feb 11 17:46:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	and fedora does not use the EPEL repos
Feb 11 17:46:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	dalley, what package
Feb 11 17:47:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	delta is the change from the current package to the new one
Feb 11 17:47:46 <dalley>	Southern_Gentlem, I know Fedora doesn't use EPEL, but the EPEL repos are managed by Fedora, and I want to know about both
Feb 11 17:47:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	so that way you only download the change and not the whole package
Feb 11 17:49:47 <dowdle>	dalley: I think that is not correct.  It might have been correct at a given point in time... I mean... multiple delta packages are needed to get you to the current version regardless of which version you might have installed... but in updates, only the current / updated package is available.
Feb 11 17:50:21 <dowdle>	dalley: But of course when a package was a fresh update it was in the repo... and as it gets replace... it gets replaced
Feb 11 17:54:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	dowdle, the delta is from package.a to package.b
Feb 11 17:54:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	now if package.c is released then it will need a new delta from b to c
Feb 11 17:55:09 <videotoaster[m]>	has bedrock linux been tested on fedora

Feb 11 18:00:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	i suspect you will run into rpmdb issues
Feb 11 18:01:16 <dowdle>	Southern_Gentlem: That's what I was saying... there will be .dprms for going from a-b a-c a-d and b-c and b-d... but only one update (the most current) in update.
Feb 11 18:01:30 <dowdle>	 (there will be MANY .drpms)
Feb 11 18:01:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	delta is only from .a to .b
Feb 11 18:02:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	otherwise it pulls the full rpm to install

Feb 11 18:11:34 <videotoaster[m]>	ditto!
Feb 11 18:16:31 <CyborgGER>	hi, do we have a working matrix client in the repo, thats worth trying out?
Feb 11 18:17:02 <toxane>	why dont you check yourself?
Feb 11 18:17:35 <videotoaster[m]>	gomuks is pretty sweet
Feb 11 18:17:41 <videotoaster[m]>	but i'm not sure if that's in the fed repos
Feb 11 18:17:43 <CyborgGER>	because the opinions of others matter to me ;)
Feb 11 18:18:13 <CyborgGER>	no, not in repo
Feb 11 18:18:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	CyborgGER, and it is highly suggested you read the channel FAQ in the topic especially the part about polling the channel
Feb 11 18:31:42 <CyborgGER>	info: both matrix clients (quaternion, nheko) crashed more or less on startup with libegl-mesa involved .. too bad.

Feb 11 18:36:18 <videotoaster[m]>	why'd tey leave
Feb 11 18:36:26 <videotoaster[m]>	i guess do what you want
Feb 11 18:47:59 <dowdle>	Please... boundaries on the net.
Feb 11 18:53:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	net has boundaries ???
Feb 11 18:53:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	i thought the net was the boundary
Feb 11 18:54:06 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Lol
Feb 11 18:54:32 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Yah ,depends on personal definition
Feb 11 18:56:00 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Btw anyone does dnf have like a save current installed packages command？
Feb 11 18:56:15 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Like create a savepoint to load or something.
Feb 11 18:58:42 <nvfanonlah[m]>	What could be the right word,checkpoint wait. I remember dnf qa can list.i think can echo to file？then in future load
Feb 11 18:58:56 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Gonna try search
Feb 11 18:59:38 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Rpm qa lol
Feb 11 18:59:40 <d9k>	'rpm -qa' gives you all the package NVRs in your rpmdb, which stores the rpm headers for all installed packages
Feb 11 19:00:26 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Thx just a lil bit late .but thanks will definitely remember it from now on.
Feb 11 19:03:23 <d9k>	if you are feelin adventurous its a sqlite db since f33, https://0x0.st/-H5o.bin
Feb 11 19:03:38 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-H5K.txt
Feb 11 19:05:45 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Ok, what is this is.i see a py script and a log？
Feb 11 19:06:24 <d9k>	its the rpm header stored for the package bash in my rpmdb
Feb 11 19:10:07 <d9k>	so if you wanted to save all installed packages outside of redownlading/pulling from cache, you could recreate all the packages from the rpmdb
Feb 11 20:11:23 <rustysysdev_>	Hello! does anyone know if it is possible to execute a command as user from %post of a kickstart?
Feb 11 20:34:13 <fyksen>	Heyo! I'm wondering if it is possible to install btrfs stripet on fedora server version.  I mean on root.  / It is supported by the installer, or should I try making the pool from the live cd first? Thanks
Feb 11 20:35:02 <cmurf>	fyksen: you can use Server dvd or netinstall, Custom or Advanced-Custom UI
Feb 11 20:35:58 <cmurf>	if you use Custom, there is a partition scheme popup with a Btrfs preset, if you choose that and click the blue text above it to create partitions automatically you'll get the same layout as the "Automatic" install path used on desktop installers
Feb 11 20:36:57 <cmurf>	Although, hmm :) I'm not certain you get a /home mountpoint on Server no matter the partition scheme
Feb 11 20:36:58 <fyksen>	Okey, but if I want striped array, is that supported in the installer also?
Feb 11 20:37:25 <cmurf>	yeah you can do that in Custom or Advanced-Custom
Feb 11 20:37:29 <fyksen>	/home is not important. Can always fix that later
Feb 11 20:38:00 <cmurf>	the UI for Custom is, click on /, then on the right there's a Volume(s) option, click on the Modify button under it
Feb 11 20:38:08 <cmurf>	and you can choose raid0 there
Feb 11 20:38:36 <slop>	mmmm butter.
Feb 11 20:38:38 <cmurf>	I'm not certain if you get raid0 metadata and data; or if you get raid0 data and raid1 metadata
Feb 11 20:38:47 <cmurf>	but you can also fix that after the installation
Feb 11 20:39:05 <cmurf>	i'll try it - you do want raid1 metadata, even for raid0 data
Feb 11 20:39:47 <fyksen>	Ahh, okey. Thanks. I will read a bit up about metadata on btrfs.
Feb 11 20:39:51 <cmurf>	while the system won't survive a full device failure, the file system itself can survive and self-heal still, if there are things like bad sectors, dropped/redirected writes
Feb 11 20:40:01 <fyksen>	But it makes sense
Feb 11 20:40:57 <cmurf>	yeah if there's any kind of isolated/limited trouble with one of the devices, at least the fs survives - but of course data is a far larger payload so chances are that's what gets hit by such corruptions
Feb 11 20:41:07 <cmurf>	and in the raid0 case it pretty much means trouble
Feb 11 20:41:37 <cmurf>	it really just depends on what the corruption hits, but btrfs will tell you that :D
Feb 11 20:42:11 <slop>	cmurf, what desktop environment do you use on your home machine(s)?
Feb 11 20:42:30 <slop>	s/environment/environments
Feb 11 20:42:58 <cmurf>	Terminal
Feb 11 20:42:59 <cmurf>	haha
Feb 11 20:43:20 <cmurf>	Firefox and Terminal - that's it
Feb 11 20:43:26 <rustysysdev_>	for any interested I ended up going with the following for running a command in the %post of my kickstart... I still haven't tested to see if it works...
Feb 11 20:43:30 <cmurf>	i'm mostly joking
Feb 11 20:43:38 <rustysysdev_>	`runuser -l rustysysdev -c 'dconf load /com/gexperts/Tilix/ < /home/rustysysdev/.rsd/dconf/tilix.dconf`
Feb 11 20:44:03 <cmurf>	fyksen: i'm gonna do an install in a VM and find out what the profiles it uses are
Feb 11 20:44:18 <slop>	Ive distro hopped a lot recerntly and always come back to fedora.
Feb 11 20:44:19 <cmurf>	but you can check it with 'btrfs fi us -T /' after you reboot from the installation
Feb 11 20:44:38 <cmurf>	that's 'btrfs filesystem usage' in long hand, sorry i use short hand by habit
Feb 11 20:45:15 <cmurf>	(a very nice trick of the btrfs commands btw, it'll let you use your own shorthand so long as it's unambiguous with other subcommands)
Feb 11 20:47:11 *	ilmarinen_[m] is now known as Travis[m]
Feb 11 20:55:42 *	ccallahan is now known as ccallahan|Away
Feb 11 21:07:15 <cmurf>	fyksen: ok it's raid0 data, raid1 metadata
Feb 11 21:07:51 <cmurf>	installer passes --data raid0 to mkfs, leaving metadata to the mkfs default which is raid1
Feb 11 21:08:01 <cmurf>	that's the correct behavior
Feb 11 21:08:53 <fyksen>	Cool, many thanks for the help testing. Waiting for my 2x 1.2tb sas ssd in the mail.
Feb 11 21:12:25 <rustysysdev_>	my full kickstart for those curious https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2076124
Feb 11 21:15:30 <cmurf>	rustysysdev_: very minor point, i probably wouldn't use xfs for /boot because in very rare cases it's possible for it to be inconsistent from the perspective of the bootloader
Feb 11 21:15:59 <cmurf>	bootloader can't do journal replay is what it comes down to
Feb 11 21:16:43 <cmurf>	xfs in particular only guarantees the journal contains metadata updates on fsync, not that the journal is flushed
Feb 11 21:18:25 <rustysysdev_>	cmurf, Interesting, and thanks! Its seems to be the default for Fedora33 when generating a new BRTFS configuration via the GUI i wonder why.. Ill look into changing it!
Feb 11 21:18:44 <cmurf>	humm
Feb 11 21:19:06 <cmurf>	i wonder if that's part of Server related kickstart stuff
Feb 11 21:19:53 <cmurf>	i think originally it was ext4 /boot and xfs /
Feb 11 21:20:05 <cmurf>	maybe it got changed to xfs for both
Feb 11 21:20:27 <cmurf>	and now with btrfs preset it defers to the Server kickstart for /boot
Feb 11 21:20:54 <rustysysdev_>	not sure, but if the bootloader cannot indeed do replay then it indeed should be changed.. I wonder if the bootloader can somehow do replay now?
Feb 11 21:21:04 <cmurf>	nope
Feb 11 21:21:08 <cmurf>	not for ext4 either
Feb 11 21:22:44 <cmurf>	it's just to complicated to have two different places to maintain journal replay code, so far no one is interested in doing it
Feb 11 21:23:17 <cmurf>	in no particular order, use FAT, ext2, ext4 with journaling disabled, or btrfs
Feb 11 21:23:23 <slop>	This community here is so nice. Ive been in other channels that people are very..... impatient? snipe-ish?
Feb 11 21:23:46 <rustysysdev_>	I have been using netinstaller for everything since fedora 21.. possibly before then.. but cannot remember. I remember it used to provision ext2, and then ext4, and now even on my 32 install its xfs
Feb 11 21:23:55 <cmurf>	i can't remember either
Feb 11 21:24:25 <cmurf>	yeah almost no chance you run into this, because also dracut does an FIFREEZE/FITHAW on /boot on xfs
Feb 11 21:24:45 <cmurf>	that flushes the journal to the fs, so that the bootloader has a consistent view
Feb 11 21:25:11 <cmurf>	so this teeny tiny issue probably won't ever happen in the usual case
Feb 11 21:25:20 <cmurf>	s/usual case/normal usage/
Feb 11 21:26:35 <cmurf>	also systemd does a umount of /boot which also flushes journal to fs metadata
Feb 11 21:27:52 <rustysysdev_>	so not a huge issue, in that the file system should never see an unclean state.. but probably better to switch.. I think ill move it to ext4 with journaling disabled.
Feb 11 21:27:53 <cmurf>	so the only time you might get in trouble is: (a) modify anything related to the current default boot files, such as /boot/loader/entries files (b) reboot -f or sysrq+b or crash
Feb 11 21:28:09 <cmurf>	not a huge issue
Feb 11 21:28:12 <cmurf>	teeny tiny
Feb 11 21:28:34 <rustysysdev_>	got it! and thanks agian!
Feb 11 21:29:00 <cmurf>	which means my review of your kickstart is weak :P
Feb 11 21:29:07 <cmurf>	someone else should look at it for something more serious
Feb 11 21:29:40 <rustysysdev_>	:D well, i will take any review over none!
Feb 11 21:41:24 <slop>	cmurf, how did you learn the items above?
Feb 11 21:44:54 <cmurf>	slop: suffering
Feb 11 21:44:56 <cmurf>	haha
Feb 11 21:45:18 <cmurf>	i dunno the whole story but someone filed a bug, they had /boot as a directory on an XFS /
Feb 11 21:45:41 <cmurf>	and something was consistently preventing the usual behavior of / being remounted ro
Feb 11 21:46:04 <cmurf>	/ can't be unmounted on a reboot, but it should be remounted ro, which also flushes the journal
Feb 11 21:46:50 <cmurf>	even though it wasn't remounted ro, the system was rebooted anyway rather than hang (which we could have a lot of legit debate about what to do about this)
Feb 11 21:47:17 <cmurf>	but the consequence was, the bootloader didn't see the changes in /boot - it saw a 0 byte grub.cfg following kernel upgrades
Feb 11 21:47:23 <slop>	haha :) very impressed no joke
Feb 11 21:47:28 <cmurf>	so it face planted
Feb 11 21:48:07 <cmurf>	and if all you did was boot from a usb rescue, and mount the file system, journal replay happened, the grub.cfg was fine
Feb 11 21:48:28 <cmurf>	but if you mounted root ro,nologreplay - it was 0 bytes
Feb 11 21:48:54 <cmurf>	so yeah, fixing it was just mount normally and then reboot, grub works now
Feb 11 21:49:17 <cmurf>	but the key thing is you want to prevent these things in the first place :)
Feb 11 21:49:23 <slop>	nice, I wouldve missed that completely. nice work
Feb 11 21:49:33 <cmurf>	oh it drove me nuts
Feb 11 21:50:00 <cmurf>	and it turns into a bit of head butting upstream, like the bootloader doing the wrong thing, the file system doing the wrong thing, on and on
Feb 11 21:50:08 <cmurf>	you know, finger pointing
Feb 11 21:50:37 <cmurf>	as it turns out, everyone is right but that doesn't solve the problem
Feb 11 21:52:00 <d9k>	if that would happen with bls you would just not get the entry for the next kernel i think
Feb 11 21:52:18 <d9k>	since all the bits are generated from the conf at /loader and grub.cfg is untouched
Feb 11 21:52:19 <cmurf>	i think so
Feb 11 21:52:22 <d9k>	should be untouched..
Feb 11 21:52:25 <cmurf>	right
Feb 11 21:52:27 <cmurf>	good point
Feb 11 21:52:46 <cmurf>	this might be totally obsoleted by bls
Feb 11 21:52:49 <slop>	cmurf, I get that completely -  thank you
Feb 11 21:53:39 <cmurf>	the last write should be to write a new bls file, and it should either be present or not
Feb 11 21:54:10 <cmurf>	from the perspective of the bootloader
Feb 11 21:54:17 <d9k>	if a new grub.cfg is moved in its place to replace it and only the metadata update happened then you would be in the same situation
Feb 11 21:54:44 <d9k>	even if it is the same data just written over
Feb 11 21:54:56 <cmurf>	right
Feb 11 21:55:07 <cmurf>	in that case it's involving rename
Feb 11 21:55:32 <d9k>	chattr +i grub.cfg problem solved hehe
Feb 11 21:55:51 <cmurf>	so you can end up with 0 length files because the journal contains the rename, not yet flushed to the fs itself which is all the bootloader sees
Feb 11 21:56:09 <d9k>	yeah
Feb 11 21:56:27 <cmurf>	in practice, nothing changes grub.cfg anymore but a sysadmin
Feb 11 21:58:26 <cmurf>	maybe one day i'll try to sabotage this again and see if i can break anything
Feb 11 21:58:56 <cmurf>	dm-log-writes would be a better way to do it
Feb 11 21:59:39 <cmurf>	it breaks down all changes so we can see whether a crash at each step results in an undesirable/unmanagable view of the filesystem
Feb 11 22:01:32 <cmurf>	dm-log-writes is really cool, one of the btrfs maintainers wrote that for power fail testing, now the xfstests that are used by all linux file systems includes tests using dm-log-writes
Feb 11 22:05:40 *	cberg goes and disables journaling on his ext4 /boot
Feb 11 22:05:44 <cmurf>	lol
Feb 11 22:06:08 <rustysysdev_>	trying to figure out how to do that from kickstart right now
Feb 11 22:06:34 <rustysysdev_>	I am guessing its an fsoption but cant find the specific option
Feb 11 22:06:36 <cmurf>	rustysysdev_: i think you're looking for --mkfsopts
Feb 11 22:06:46 <cmurf>	and it's -O ^journal something something
Feb 11 22:06:53 <rustysysdev_>	lol
Feb 11 22:06:54 <d9k>	that reminded me that i still have a btrfs crash to report, one of these days im gonna do it https://0x0.st/-H7i.txt
Feb 11 22:07:11 <d9k>	5.10.5 still works
Feb 11 22:07:14 <rustysysdev_>	Thanks! Ill see if I can find it!
Feb 11 22:07:39 <cmurf>	d9k check line 2
Feb 11 22:07:41 <cmurf>	# BTRFS critical (device ram0): corrupt leaf: block=1815937024 slot=85 extent bytenr=67174400 len=1007496933805460773 invalid extent data ref hash, item has 0x0dfb591f93c50d24 key has 0x0dfb591f93c50d25
Feb 11 22:07:56 <cmurf>	bit flip of the checksum itself
Feb 11 22:07:59 <d9k>	yeah i know, lots and lots of shared extents
Feb 11 22:08:02 <d9k>	the file is very big
Feb 11 22:08:22 <cmurf>	i didn't even get that far
Feb 11 22:08:37 <cmurf>	the corrupt leaf is metadata corruption, that's a big deal
Feb 11 22:08:42 <cmurf>	this looks like xxhash?
Feb 11 22:08:53 <d9k>	no
Feb 11 22:09:02 <d9k>	the mkfs is right there
Feb 11 22:09:42 <cmurf>	this is reproducible?
Feb 11 22:09:44 <d9k>	very
Feb 11 22:09:49 <d9k>	that is the reproducer
Feb 11 22:09:58 <d9k>	happens very fast
Feb 11 22:10:16 <cmurf>	line 4, the write time tree checker sees it
Feb 11 22:10:23 <cmurf>	and goes ro to prevent further corruption
Feb 11 22:10:44 <cmurf>	a reproducible bit flip in the checksum - that's curious
Feb 11 22:11:44 <d9k>	that generates a initramfs image that you can run in qemu with -kernel -initrd
Feb 11 22:12:42 <cmurf>	this is cool, wish i understood it better
Feb 11 22:13:05 <cmurf>	yeah so just file a bug containing this whole thing in the description, file against kernel
Feb 11 22:13:23 <d9k>	https://github.com/tlahdekorpi/archivegen/tree/aligned + https://github.com/tlahdekorpi/mkinitcpio-ag
Feb 11 22:13:32 <cmurf>	once it's submitted, you should be able to change the assignee field to ...
Feb 11 22:13:49 <d9k>	im very bad at submitting bug reports
Feb 11 22:13:58 <cmurf>	fedora-kernel-btrfs@fedoraproject.org
Feb 11 22:14:21 <cmurf>	this doesn't need much explanation i think?
Feb 11 22:14:49 <cmurf>	i mean, even post it on linux-btrfs@, subject "reproducible bit flip?" haha
Feb 11 22:16:57 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-H7K.txt
Feb 11 22:18:02 <cmurf>	i like the other one better
Feb 11 22:18:22 <cmurf>	line 8 has an anomaly
Feb 11 22:18:31 <cmurf>	Filesystem size: is followed by a single dmesg line
Feb 11 22:18:39 <d9k>	its qemu output
Feb 11 22:18:41 <d9k>	i copied
Feb 11 22:19:22 <rustysysdev_>	cmurf, sorry to inturrupt your conversation with d9k, but how is this: `part /boot --fstype="ext4" --mkfsoptions="-O ^has_journal" --ondisk=sda --size=1024`
Feb 11 22:19:41 <cmurf>	looks correct
Feb 11 22:19:49 <rustysysdev_>	Thanks!
Feb 11 22:20:18 <cmurf>	the idea of journal replay is to avoid lengthy fsck, it doesn't inherently make the fs safer
Feb 11 22:20:39 <cmurf>	and an unclean shutdown means ext4 gets an fsck, it's pretty fast on a dedicated /boot volume
Feb 11 22:21:07 <cmurf>	and chances are the bootloader won't get confused, either old or new file will be there
Feb 11 22:21:21 <cmurf>	:P
Feb 11 22:21:37 <rustysysdev_>	got it! testing the install now!
Feb 11 22:21:39 <rustysysdev_>	:)
Feb 11 22:21:39 <cmurf>	we are in the territory of how many angels dance on headpins
Feb 11 22:21:42 <rustysysdev_>	lol
Feb 11 22:21:54 *	Guest53040 is now known as piter
Feb 11 22:21:56 <d9k>	you can run this yourself, also submit if you feel like it. i did the same thing backwards with c and libarchive and ran into another bug
Feb 11 22:22:06 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/iOnY.txt this a few months ago
Feb 11 22:22:12 *	piter is now known as peter
Feb 11 22:22:32 *	peter is now known as piterpan
Feb 11 22:22:55 <d9k>	not that reproducible than the other one
Feb 11 22:23:09 <cmurf>	and that's a loop device
Feb 11 22:24:02 <d9k>	yes?, i dont want to crash my rootfs
Feb 11 22:24:47 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/iOnI.c this is the c bits
Feb 11 22:25:03 <d9k>	now that only works on a very specific looking tars
Feb 11 22:25:41 <cmurf>	yeah i just mean it's not isolated to some sort of ramdisk weirdness
Feb 11 22:27:04 <d9k>	i tried to do a small reproducer in c but failed
Feb 11 22:27:11 <cmurf>	either upstream email list, or file a rhbz bug with the assignee changed
Feb 11 22:27:26 <cmurf>	if the assignee can't be changed you can put in cc: field or ping me and i'll change it
Feb 11 22:27:46 <cmurf>	and then the right people get informed
Feb 11 22:28:23 <cmurf>	so is the bit flip something you're inducing? i don't follow that
Feb 11 22:28:34 <cmurf>	or it something that just happens?
Feb 11 22:28:46 <d9k>	im literally creating a tar with shared extents over and over of the same file
Feb 11 22:28:52 <cmurf>	the bit flip isn't normal, but the file system doing a hard stop is normal
Feb 11 22:30:20 <cmurf>	do you think the examples are all related?
Feb 11 22:31:09 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/iVeT.txt this happened once doing the extract backwards but i cant reproduce
Feb 11 22:32:22 <d9k>	its all something to do with enospc i think
Feb 11 22:32:50 <d9k>	but not completely certain
Feb 11 22:33:00 <cmurf>	include kernel version
Feb 11 22:33:08 <cmurf>	these are all 5.10?
Feb 11 22:33:18 <d9k>	just the latest
Feb 11 22:33:31 <d9k>	5.10.15
Feb 11 22:34:13 <cmurf>	there are definitely dark corners related to enospc still, but i'm not aware of any of them that results in bitflips
Feb 11 22:36:18 <d9k>	can you reproduce that?
Feb 11 22:37:17 <cmurf>	i can't code my way out of a hat
Feb 11 22:38:06 <cmurf>	and this looks like someone who can, would be able to reproduce if it's reproducible
Feb 11 22:38:59 <cmurf>	if i've got descrete steps then  yeah i'd run it on 5.11-rc7+debug and see if it reproduces
Feb 11 22:45:32 <cmurf>	d9k: the very first one https://0x0.st/-H7i.txt
Feb 11 22:45:50 <cmurf>	you always git a bit flip? or does the problem vary?
Feb 11 22:45:51 <d9k>	im making instructions
Feb 11 22:45:54 <d9k>	always
Feb 11 22:45:56 <d9k>	100%
Feb 11 22:46:28 <cmurf>	and are you using btrfs elsewhere like for sysroot? and you never have btrfs report issues there?
Feb 11 22:46:39 <cmurf>	(on the same computer)
Feb 11 22:47:15 <d9k>	yes, and im not doing funny stuff like sharing too many extents
Feb 11 22:47:28 <d9k>	and no issues
Feb 11 22:47:31 <d9k>	recently
Feb 11 22:48:02 <cmurf>	well sharing many exents is something btrfs just does, sorta baked into the game
Feb 11 22:48:10 <TheHermann>	what is the best way to install discord?
Feb 11 22:48:18 <cmurf>	you snapshot / and 100% of the extents are now shared
Feb 11 22:49:09 <cmurf>	but it doesn't matter how much of an edge case your test is, if it's reproducible it's probably a bug somewhere, not sure where
Feb 11 22:49:23 <linuxmodder>	TheHermann, in rpmfusion or flatpak
Feb 11 22:50:07 <d9k>	so what the point of that whole feature is to make cpios where all the files are shared extents and the archive only takes a few kb
Feb 11 22:50:17 <d9k>	for initramfs images, instead of compression and copying
Feb 11 22:50:23 <d9k>	it works fine, btrfs just crashes
Feb 11 22:55:46 <TheHermann>	linuxmodder, thanks :)
Feb 11 22:57:38 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-H7V.txt now it actually crashed
Feb 11 23:06:09 <d9k>	cmurf: instructions https://0x0.st/-H7w.txt, im sure you'll manage
Feb 11 23:16:22 <slop>	with my level of experience.. would be a reload  :D
Feb 11 23:19:29 <cmurf>	d9k: what all should i install on top of f34 (branched rawhide now) for this?
Feb 11 23:19:34 <cmurf>	do i need go?
Feb 11 23:19:37 <d9k>	only go
Feb 11 23:19:43 <d9k>	and gawk?
Feb 11 23:22:12 <cmurf>	not sure what $ # modify mkinitcpio to contain the archivegen binary in PATH means
Feb 11 23:22:35 <d9k>	the mkinitcpio script has a PATH variable at the top, point it to the cloned archivegen directory
Feb 11 23:22:50 <d9k>	so it can generate the reprocuder and include itself in it
Feb 11 23:23:02 <d9k>	or preprend to the beginning!
Feb 11 23:24:12 <cmurf>	relative or absolute path?
Feb 11 23:24:15 <cmurf>	../archivegen/archivegen
Feb 11 23:24:17 <d9k>	absolute
Feb 11 23:24:25 <d9k>	it doesnt matter
Feb 11 23:24:35 <d9k>	but just make it absolute
Feb 11 23:24:38 <cmurf>	does ~/ count or should it be strictly absolute
Feb 11 23:24:45 <d9k>	path doesnt expand ~
Feb 11 23:24:49 <d9k>	i think?
Feb 11 23:25:10 <cmurf>	*shrug* i'll do /home/chris/playground.test/archivegen/archivegen
Feb 11 23:25:38 <d9k>	oh it does
Feb 11 23:26:39 <digup>	hey guys, I have problem opening gnome-boxes
Feb 11 23:26:49 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-H75.txt, now i know
Feb 11 23:27:18 <foxide>	You can also use $HOME
Feb 11 23:27:39 <cmurf>	where is PATH in the mkinitcpio file? i see export PATH
Feb 11 23:27:48 <d9k>	exactly that
Feb 11 23:28:07 <cmurf>	replace what's there or add to the end?
Feb 11 23:28:26 <d9k>	foxide: it is expanded by the shell using normal convention, so '$HOME' wont work, ~ is special case
Feb 11 23:28:47 <d9k>	it doesnt matter since it only is used for looking up the archivegen binary
Feb 11 23:29:00 <foxide>	d9k: Bet you you're wrong.
Feb 11 23:29:10 <cmurf>	 24 export PATH='/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/home/chris/playground.test/archivegen/archivegen'
Feb 11 23:29:14 <d9k>	yeah
Feb 11 23:29:28 <d9k>	make sure thats the directory
Feb 11 23:29:31 <d9k>	not the binary
Feb 11 23:29:53 <foxide>	d9k: https://bpa.st/IJSA
Feb 11 23:30:07 <d9k>	foxide: try PATH='$HOME' type -P .bashrc
Feb 11 23:30:20 <d9k>	you are expanding the $HOME variable inside ""
Feb 11 23:30:23 <d9k>	use literals
Feb 11 23:30:48 <cmurf>	ok so next i go to https://0x0.st/-H7i.txt save all that out as a file named reproducer
Feb 11 23:31:03 <d9k>	literally copy paste the command i had in the instructions
Feb 11 23:31:27 <d9k>	yes
Feb 11 23:31:45 <cmurf>	i'm copying the whole thing unless that's wrong
Feb 11 23:31:52 <d9k>	the entire thing
Feb 11 23:31:54 <cmurf>	into mkinitcpio-ag/
Feb 11 23:32:12 <d9k>	into your $PWD
Feb 11 23:32:29 <d9k>	literally curl the-url > reproducer
Feb 11 23:32:51 <cmurf>	well i'm still in mkinitcpio-ag
Feb 11 23:32:59 <d9k>	dont move!
Feb 11 23:33:00 <cmurf>	so i assume in there
Feb 11 23:33:04 <d9k>	yes
Feb 11 23:33:42 <d9k>	ah right you need busybox ofc
Feb 11 23:33:56 <cmurf>	$ head -n1 reproducer
Feb 11 23:33:57 <cmurf>	# mkinitcpio -o busybox -K btrfs,brd - < btrfs-crash > out
Feb 11 23:34:40 <cmurf>	installing busybox, do i need to repeat the head command afterward?
Feb 11 23:34:48 <d9k>	thats just a reminder what to run
Feb 11 23:35:38 <cmurf>	ok so i should run ./mkinitcpio -o busybox -K btrfs,brd - < reproducer > out
Feb 11 23:35:52 <d9k>	yes
Feb 11 23:36:12 <cmurf>	./mkinitcpio: line 494: archivegen: command not found
Feb 11 23:36:13 <cmurf>	hmm
Feb 11 23:36:30 <d9k>	did you put the path to the binary instead of the directory containing the binary
Feb 11 23:37:20 <cmurf>	yes
Feb 11 23:37:29 <d9k>	are you sure?
Feb 11 23:38:06 <cmurf>	pretty sure
Feb 11 23:38:08 <cmurf>	https://paste.centos.org/view/0077f2f3
Feb 11 23:38:20 <d9k>	thats the binary
Feb 11 23:38:23 <d9k>	not the directory
Feb 11 23:38:54 <d9k>	PATH works in directories, '/home/chris/playground.test/archivegen' is what you want
Feb 11 23:39:48 <cmurf>	soexport PATH='/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/home/chris/playground.test/archivegen'
Feb 11 23:39:53 <d9k>	yes!
Feb 11 23:39:54 <cmurf>	that works now
Feb 11 23:40:22 <cmurf>	ok so for the qemu command...
Feb 11 23:40:47 <cmurf>	should i at some point virsh console to watch it blow up or will it dump to stdout in the terminal window?
Feb 11 23:41:10 <d9k>	nope just qemu will do
Feb 11 23:42:03 <cmurf>	https://paste.centos.org/view/84f4186e
Feb 11 23:42:45 <d9k>	your kernel is /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)
Feb 11 23:42:46 <cmurf>	where is the path to kernel file so i can change it
Feb 11 23:43:01 <cmurf>	oh i'm a literal idiot
Feb 11 23:43:02 <cmurf>	haha
Feb 11 23:43:59 <cmurf>	https://paste.centos.org/view/15e7d6bd
Feb 11 23:44:36 <d9k>	you can use -curses
Feb 11 23:44:38 <cmurf>	is gtk in this case a reference to gtk2? that's not included in f34 by default
Feb 11 23:44:44 <d9k>	or -nographic should work too
Feb 11 23:46:06 <d9k>	instead of '-serial stdio -vga none' you can just -nographic
Feb 11 23:47:44 <cmurf>	oooooo it's running!
Feb 11 23:49:06 <cmurf>	reproduces
Feb 11 23:49:18 <cmurf>	but slightly different or maybe the line is cut off
Feb 11 23:49:22 <d9k>	nice, did it crash or write time corruption
Feb 11 23:49:24 <cmurf>	this line looks cut off
Feb 11 23:49:28 <cmurf>	write time corruption

Feb 12 00:07:34 <d9k>	you dont need to use just qemu, virt-manager can do all the vm bits if thats more comfortable
Feb 12 00:07:39 <d9k>	qemu directly*
Feb 12 00:08:18 <d9k>	you need to add virtio-blk to the image
Feb 12 00:08:51 <d9k>	so -K virtio-blk,btrfs,brd
Feb 12 00:08:51 <cmurf>	what device does -hda become in the vm?
Feb 12 00:08:54 <d9k>	sda
Feb 12 00:09:04 <cmurf>	i see sda but writing to it doesn't show up in the host
Feb 12 00:09:15 <cmurf>	the file is still 0 length
Feb 12 00:09:20 <d9k>	write caching?
Feb 12 00:09:34 <cmurf>	*shrug*
Feb 12 00:09:37 <cmurf>	still 0
Feb 12 00:09:39 <cmurf>	been a while
Feb 12 00:09:49 <d9k>	do a mkfs.btrfs and write a real file in there
Feb 12 00:10:38 <cmurf>	there's a hint, it's not sparse, it's literally 0 so it can't be written to, even mkfs fails haha
Feb 12 00:14:01 <cmurf>	ok that is doing what i want
Feb 12 00:14:06 <cmurf>	and i don't have to mkfs
Feb 12 00:14:24 <d9k>	this is just a minimal reprocuder i made to run in a unattended vm but you can run the for loop ofc on your running kernel
Feb 12 00:14:28 <d9k>	NOT on your own rootfs
Feb 12 00:14:44 <d9k>	that would be bad
Feb 12 00:15:53 <d9k>	a separate kernel is just help with not crashing your running system accidentally, or corrupting anything
Feb 12 00:16:15 <cmurf>	yeah
Feb 12 00:16:38 <cmurf>	this is one reason why i use subvolumes/rw snapshots to isolate things
Feb 12 00:16:59 <cmurf>	it's still shared trees for everything but that file tree
Feb 12 00:17:50 <cmurf>	but if the corruption can be trimmed out by just deleting a subvolume, it just dereferences nodes that contain the problem rather than cow
Feb 12 00:18:03 <cmurf>	if it read it, to cow, it'd hit the corruption and faceplant
Feb 12 00:18:08 <cmurf>	just like in qemu
Feb 12 00:18:27 <cmurf>	but oh ignore what i just wrote - the root file system would go read only because of this
Feb 12 00:19:00 <cmurf>	the question is whether the write time tree check stopped it before it was written out, and i think the answer to that is yes
Feb 12 00:19:06 <cmurf>	might be cool to prove it
Feb 12 00:19:08 <cmurf>	:D
Feb 12 00:19:13 <d9k>	umount and mount again
Feb 12 00:19:15 <d9k>	files are gone
Feb 12 00:19:31 <cmurf>	i think you'd have to reboot
Feb 12 00:19:35 <d9k>	no no
Feb 12 00:19:39 <d9k>	just umount after the crash
Feb 12 00:19:44 <cmurf>	unmount what
Feb 12 00:19:49 <cmurf>	unmount /
Feb 12 00:19:54 <cmurf>	i'm talking about doing this NOT in qemu
Feb 12 00:19:59 <d9k>	oh
Feb 12 00:20:02 <d9k>	ohh
Feb 12 00:20:02 <cmurf>	on baremetal with my real file system
Feb 12 00:20:15 <cmurf>	come on i'm a saboture
Feb 12 00:20:35 <cmurf>	saboteur even :P
Feb 12 00:21:19 <cmurf>	but yeah what you describe is what i expect, you'd reboot, and things would be fine you'd just lose whatever happened since the last 30s commit
Feb 12 00:22:13 <cmurf>	ok i'll ask one of the maintainers about it and if they need more info
Feb 12 00:22:54 <d9k>	since this is a quick reprocuder i imagine it wouldnt be too hard to debug, since reproducing is always the hard bit
Feb 12 00:23:03 <cmurf>	do you know if this uses o_direct?
Feb 12 00:23:15 <cmurf>	well the backing file is memory so this can be that bug hmm
Feb 12 00:23:27 <d9k>	i think so
Feb 12 00:23:42 <d9k>	or what you mean
Feb 12 00:23:49 <cmurf>	so
Feb 12 00:24:28 <cmurf>	consider a more persistent virt-manager setup, raw backing file, and you use a cache mode that supports o_direct like none
Feb 12 00:24:39 <cmurf>	or directsync
Feb 12 00:25:07 <cmurf>	and if that raw backing file is on btrfs, and is datacow, your raw backing file is being checksummed
Feb 12 00:25:45 <cmurf>	o_direct allows file systems to do inflight changes of buffered data, there's no enforcement for stable writes
Feb 12 00:26:22 <cmurf>	so we get a write and checksum for the write in the raw file; and a subsequent inflight write changes the data does not update the csum and we start seeing csum errors
Feb 12 00:27:24 <cmurf>	part of why the default is nodatacow for raw/qcow2 files on btrfs with libvirt, and the default cache mode is writeback
Feb 12 00:27:28 <cmurf>	problem doesn't happen with either of those
Feb 12 00:27:43 <cmurf>	i have a bug for that

Feb 12 08:21:05 <mkowalski_>	Good morning
Feb 12 08:21:52 <mkowalski_>	Question about reporting such a problem - dmesg for `input` shows a device name with the typo; what would be the best place to report such an issue?
Feb 12 08:22:27 <mkowalski_>	Does it belong under xlibinput or is it something more for the OS itself?
Feb 12 08:23:19 <chrisawi>	are you sure it's not coming from the device itself? what is the typo exactly?
Feb 12 08:24:06 <mkowalski_>	Ok, so yesterday I've been updating kernel and some other packages. Before I had `'Logitech MX Ergo Mouse'` which now became `'Logitech MX Ergo Multi-Device Trackball '` <-- note the space at the end
Feb 12 08:24:26 <mkowalski_>	Given that it's the same device, it's not something that would be coming from it I guess (otherwise why would the name change)
Feb 12 08:36:28 <chrisawi>	maybe the logitech unifying receiver got a firmware update via fwupd?
Feb 12 08:37:18 <mkowalski_>	It's a bluetooth device and no fw update happened in between
Feb 12 08:37:28 <mkowalski_>	https://pastebin.com/raw/phbLsLun <-- some info if anything would help here, but I doubt
Feb 12 08:37:49 <mkowalski_>	From the bluetoothctl perspective its name is only "MX Ergo", so I wonder where exactly the full name comes from
Feb 12 08:39:48 <mkowalski_>	From the update log I see that it's been kernel upgrading to 5.10.13 and libevdev to 1.11.0, so I wonder if that could be coming from the latter
Feb 12 08:43:08 <mkowalski_>	In the kernel itself I have only managed to find this commit -- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7de843dbaaa68aa514090e6226ed7c6374fd7e49 -- but it does not seem to be included in 5.10.13, thus probably irrelevant
Feb 12 11:29:40 <mrvenkman>	Hi. Using Gnome boxes - I have found that deleting the box via the right click menu, there is no warning, but there is a "undo delete" that pops up straight away.
Feb 12 11:30:54 <mrvenkman>	Clicking on "undo delete" doesn't undo deleting the box. It is deleted. LUCKILY I knew this behaviour and backed up the image. However, restoring the images into ./local/gnome-boxes/images - the option to use that box still isn't available. I presume I need to also restore some meta data.
Feb 12 11:31:14 <mrvenkman>	Anyone know where this meta data is normally stored and what it needs to contain?
Feb 12 11:35:28 <mrvenkman>	https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/25/html/Virtualization_Getting_Started_Guide/delete-box.html
Feb 12 11:35:48 <mrvenkman>	" Click the X on the confirmation notification if you are sure you have deleted the correct boxes. Or click UNDO if you made a mistake. "
Feb 12 11:36:31 <mrvenkman>	Fedora 33 - clicking undo definitely doesn't undo it. If you click undo, then close gnome boxes and reopen gnome boxes, the image is gone.

Feb 12 15:58:45 <Khaytsus>	Nope, it does not use dkms.
Feb 12 15:59:03 <AlwaysLivid>	uninstalling and making sure that i'll use rpmfusion instead
Feb 12 15:59:13 <AlwaysLivid>	although i think i replaced it specifically for that reason
Feb 12 15:59:28 <AlwaysLivid>	i couldn't downgrade using rpmfusion because the bleeding edge drivers broke it, i downgraded through the .run package
Feb 12 15:59:37 <AlwaysLivid>	and nothing really happened
Feb 12 15:59:39 <Khaytsus>	Oh lord.
Feb 12 15:59:50 <AlwaysLivid>	eh, it's fine, i already cleaned up
Feb 12 15:59:53 <Khaytsus>	I specifically asked about the .run package.  You said you used rpmfusion.
Feb 12 15:59:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	no you havent
Feb 12 16:00:00 <Khaytsus>	So clean all that up and if you have trouble ask again.
Feb 12 16:00:27 <AlwaysLivid>	I mean, I originally used RPMFusion when the problem happened.
Feb 12 16:00:54 <AlwaysLivid>	then disclosed that I switched to the "local repository thing"
Feb 12 16:00:56 <AlwaysLivid>	but yeah, will do
Feb 12 16:01:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	so clean up by the rpmfusion documentation
Feb 12 16:01:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	reinstall to the rpmfusion documentation
Feb 12 16:02:29 <AlwaysLivid>	Are the Cuda drivers installable with RPMFusion?
Feb 12 16:02:40 <AlwaysLivid>	(as in with the software libraries and everything)
Feb 12 16:02:45 <Southern_Gentlem>	read their documentation
Feb 12 16:03:47 <AlwaysLivid>	yeah i already tried to look that up extensively, was weirdened out about how i have to combine rpmfusion with nvidia's own repositories: https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/CUDA
Feb 12 16:04:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/NVIDIA?highlight=%28%5CbCategoryHowto%5Cb%29
Feb 12 16:05:18 <Khaytsus>	Yes CUDA is in rpmfusion by default afaik
Feb 12 16:05:39 <AlwaysLivid>	understood, was weirdened out because i also installed the package named in that document but had some issues with compiling a project
Feb 12 16:05:47 <osezer>	Yes cuda is in rpmfusion*
Feb 12 16:05:48 <AlwaysLivid>	i'll hack around with it later after i get nvidia working again for starters
Feb 12 16:06:12 <toxane>	no takers of my permissions problem?
Feb 12 16:06:30 <AlwaysLivid>	apologies for stealing the spotlight :P
Feb 12 16:06:39 <toxane>	hehe :P
Feb 12 16:07:09 <Khaytsus>	toxane: Not sure what your question; it should just work as long as you're using defaults.  Any diferent ports will need selinux tweaks.
Feb 12 16:07:16 <osezer>	toxane:  default nginx just need firewall perm "no selinux" stuff required.
Feb 12 16:07:36 <toxane>	strange
Feb 12 16:07:42 <osezer>	It is already set (selinıx config for nginx)  just start service and give perm to firewall and done
Feb 12 16:07:54 <Khaytsus>	Again, unless he's using different ports than default.
Feb 12 16:07:54 <osezer>	That's all I do nothing else
Feb 12 16:08:16 <toxane>	index.html has 0644 and for the directory 0755
Feb 12 16:08:20 <Khaytsus>	http_port_t defines what ports it can use.
Feb 12 16:08:27 <osezer>	Khaytsus:  yes, true
Feb 12 16:08:40 <toxane>	and i use default ports
Feb 12 16:08:42 <Khaytsus>	toxane: I guses you'll have to look at the audit log to make sure it's not selinux, it'd show up there...  and otherwise, nginx logs
Feb 12 16:08:59 <toxane>	ah, audit log
Feb 12 16:09:44 <AlwaysLivid>	I studied https://arewewaylandyet.com/ and was also surprised to see that NVIDIA worked under Wayland in Fedora, wasn't too keen to see it break. The docs also mention disabling Wayland for the time being, so I presume that I'm also supposed to do that, right?
Feb 12 16:10:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	so basicly run gnome on X yes
Feb 12 16:10:21 <Khaytsus>	wayland does not work with nvidia to my knowledge
Feb 12 16:10:58 <osezer>	Khaytsus:  they sent a patch for "kde" and "wayland" team for in order to work. (hopefully work)
Feb 12 16:10:59 <AlwaysLivid>	yeah it's pretty much broken most of the time but it did work under optimus (which means that it was using my intel igpu but sometimes. for some windows. it used the nvidia card) to my pleasant surprise
Feb 12 16:11:16 <AlwaysLivid>	until it didn't :P
Feb 12 16:11:31 <Khaytsus>	Let me restate; I would not attempt to use wayland with nvidia yet.
Feb 12 16:11:50 <AlwaysLivid>	yeahhhhhh, me neither
Feb 12 16:11:57 <AlwaysLivid>	reason: i did
Feb 12 16:16:01 <ComputerKid>	Hello all! I have a question. Would it be possible to/has anyone tried running to instances of Fedora on the same BTRFS pool, but with seperate root and home sub vols?
Feb 12 16:18:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	ComputerKid, thats not going to work the way you asked the quesiton
Feb 12 16:18:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	question
Feb 12 16:18:46 <ComputerKid>	How come?
Feb 12 16:19:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	the way you wrote that is multiple verson of fedora in the same pool
Feb 12 16:19:25 <ComputerKid>	yup
Feb 12 16:19:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	so the same pool will be using the same subvolumes
Feb 12 16:19:55 <Southern_Gentlem>	so no it will be one version of fedora
Feb 12 16:20:05 <ComputerKid>	why?
Feb 12 16:20:16 <ComputerKid>	I'm sorry, I don't understand
Feb 12 16:20:36 <Southern_Gentlem>	the pool is a subvolume of / and a subvolume of /home
Feb 12 16:20:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	you would need separate subvolumes for each fedora version
Feb 12 16:21:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	you would need separate / subvolumes for each fedora version
Feb 12 16:21:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	home could be shared
Feb 12 16:21:54 <ComputerKid>	Okay, that's what I meant. I thought that the pool was the top layer, and the subvols were under it
Feb 12 16:22:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	the pool is all
Feb 12 16:22:15 <ComputerKid>	okay
Feb 12 16:22:29 <ComputerKid>	I could share the home but I wonder if that would cause issues
Feb 12 16:22:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	you would need a separate subvolume for each /
Feb 12 16:22:46 <ComputerKid>	👍
Feb 12 16:23:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	also you will have to edit grub to boot each release per subvolume
Feb 12 16:23:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	so you will have more than one pool for this to happen IMHO
Feb 12 16:23:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	i will defer to cmurf when he comes in
Feb 12 16:24:43 <ComputerKid>	So would it be better to have multiple BTRFS partitions?
Feb 12 16:24:54 <ComputerKid>	And have my boot partition point to both?
Feb 12 16:27:29 <Khaytsus>	That seems like a mess to me honestly..  Will a VM not do what you need?
Feb 12 16:30:32 <Southern_Gentlem>	ComputerKid, i suggest setting up vms and test
Feb 12 16:31:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	and as i said before I defer to cmurf
Feb 12 16:31:21 <Southern_Gentlem>	he is the btrfs expert
Feb 12 16:32:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	ComputerKid, besides vms the easy way would be dual booting the machine
Feb 12 16:32:26 <ComputerKid>	So, the issue I am solving for is that I run my OS in a way where I break stuff. all the time. and I just live with it, I guess I am in a learning phase. But also I need to get stuff done sometime, without interruptions
Feb 12 16:32:39 <ComputerKid>	Southern_Gentlem Dual booting was my idea
Feb 12 16:32:52 <ComputerKid>	I just didn't know if I needed 1 or 2 BTRFS partitions
Feb 12 16:33:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	you will need a btrfs pool for each release
Feb 12 16:33:27 <Khaytsus>	VM sounds perfect for you then
Feb 12 16:33:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	but for the issue you stated build a VM
Feb 12 16:33:35 <Khaytsus>	You can snapshot it and uh..  do whatever dumb stuff you're doing...  and restore snapshot if you break it
Feb 12 16:33:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	play in the VM and leave your host stable
Feb 12 16:33:49 <ComputerKid>	Khaytsus do whatever dumb stuff 🤣 XD
Feb 12 16:33:59 <Khaytsus>	I mean seriously..  I haven't broken a system in many years
Feb 12 16:34:29 <ComputerKid>	Okay
Feb 12 16:34:55 <ComputerKid>	I may need to reinstall again, I still have some random cruft floating around on my system
Feb 12 16:35:10 <ComputerKid>	*radom broken cruft

Feb 12 16:41:56 <toxane>	i dont get it. i gave "0775" to the nginx user, still permission denied
Feb 12 16:42:38 <toxane>	the error log says permission denied aswell without further info why
Feb 12 16:43:27 <Southern_Gentlem>	service running?
Feb 12 16:43:40 <toxane>	it could not write to the log otherwise :)
Feb 12 16:44:17 <toxane>	it sees my requests
Feb 12 16:44:34 <Southern_Gentlem>	google fedora selinux nginx
Feb 12 16:44:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	i am seeing several pages
Feb 12 16:44:51 <toxane>	i did, tried a few things. problem persists
Feb 12 16:45:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	so did you try setenforce 0
Feb 12 16:45:23 <toxane>	no, because selinux is the reason why i selected fedora
Feb 12 16:45:43 <Southern_Gentlem>	that way you can see if selinux is blocking or not
Feb 12 16:46:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	also if it is it should generate errors you can fix
Feb 12 16:46:16 <toxane>	but why does audit.log contain no single hint?
Feb 12 16:46:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	setroubleshoot
Feb 12 16:46:50 <Southern_Gentlem>	no idea but try selinux in permissive so that is one thing that can be ruled out
Feb 12 16:47:17 <Khaytsus>	Enforcing would still show in audit logs in most cases, but..
Feb 12 16:47:40 <Khaytsus>	Did you even look in the audit log yet toxane?  It was the first thing i suggested.
Feb 12 16:47:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	setenforce 0 is a easy quick test
Feb 12 16:48:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	Khaytsus, <toxane> but why does audit.log contain no single hint?
Feb 12 16:48:22 <toxane>	am i still here? *poke, poke*
Feb 12 16:49:11 <toxane>	all terminals to the server frozen. it gets better and better :)
Feb 12 16:55:08 <toxane>	permissive and "no enforcement" did not chance
Feb 12 16:55:08 <dowdle>	toxane: No, you are in another universe.
Feb 12 16:55:18 <toxane>	heh
Feb 12 16:56:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	so its not selinux, so go back and look at what you changed
Feb 12 17:12:10 <AlwaysLivid>	hey, i disabled the nvidia repository on rpmfusion to use the .run binary but i forgot how to uhhh re-enable it

Feb 12 17:13:30 <AlwaysLivid>	uh i should rephrase; what's the repository name of the nvidia repository?
Feb 12 17:14:00 <FranciscoD>	AlwaysLivid: ls /etc/yum.repos.d/ should show you
Feb 12 17:14:11 <FranciscoD>	I don't have it here, no nvidia hardware :/
Feb 12 17:14:21 <AlwaysLivid>	appreciated ^--^

Feb 12 17:15:09 <Southern_Gentlem>	AlwaysLivid, ^^
Feb 12 17:15:52 <Khaytsus>	Using the .run binary again!?
Feb 12 17:15:57 <AlwaysLivid>	why would i
Feb 12 17:16:16 <AlwaysLivid>	apparently you were right, i didn't manage to clean up the entire thing :P https://dpaste.com/87BYVKV5G
Feb 12 17:17:07 <AlwaysLivid>	rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver seems to be enabled (enabled=1, enabled_metadata=1)
Feb 12 17:19:05 <Southern_Gentlem>	AlwaysLivid, use fpaste please
Feb 12 17:19:42 <AlwaysLivid>	https://paste.centos.org/view/9f6d6cac
Feb 12 17:20:17 <Khaytsus>	AlwaysLivid: Okay I misread your statement a few ago..  I thought you said "I disabled rpmfusion to use the .run file" but I see what you meant now.
Feb 12 17:20:44 <AlwaysLivid>	yeah, pretty much tried a bunch of stuff
Feb 12 17:20:46 <AlwaysLivid>	some of which i vehemently regret now
Feb 12 17:22:16 <MathAkemi[m]>	I haven't gotten wine to work on SIlverblue yet.
Feb 12 17:27:18 <AlwaysLivid>	does installing nouveau (which i've blocked) automatically block you from installing akmod-nvidia?
Feb 12 17:30:17 <Khaytsus>	AlwaysLivid: nouveau should not be touched at any time
Feb 12 17:30:21 <Khaytsus>	Not the package, not the module...
Feb 12 17:30:35 <Khaytsus>	the nvidia rpmfusion packages handle anything necessary
Feb 12 17:30:52 <AlwaysLivid>	fair, i'll remove the modprobe rule
Feb 12 17:31:09 <AlwaysLivid>	what do i do about not being able to install the package though
Feb 12 17:32:13 <ledeni>	AlwaysLivid➡ which package?
Feb 12 17:32:26 <AlwaysLivid>	https://paste.centos.org/view/9f6d6cac
Feb 12 17:32:29 <AlwaysLivid>	akmod-nvidia
Feb 12 17:33:52 <AlwaysLivid>	or xorg-x11-drv-nvidia
Feb 12 17:38:22 <ledeni>	AlwaysLivid➡  can you give us ls /etc/yum.repos.d/ | fpaste
Feb 12 17:39:21 <AlwaysLivid>	https://paste.centos.org/view/0e11e2dd ledeni
Feb 12 17:43:57 <AlwaysLivid>	what's wrong?
Feb 12 17:47:17 <ledeni>	AlwaysLivid➡ for me repos look alright
Feb 12 17:47:34 <AlwaysLivid>	enabled module_hotfixes=true for the nvidia repository (disabled modular filtering for the repository), seems to work alright now
Feb 12 19:06:00 <atrus>	running an efi fedora 33 system, and trying to change some boot options, I ran "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg" -- but now /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg seems to be missing any menuentry-items for fedora -- no rescue or kernel  entries at all.
Feb 12 19:07:03 *	noidea__ is now known as noidea_
Feb 12 19:09:27 <atrus>	i've reverted the change to /etc/default/grub, but it's still not showing any menuentry for fedora at all, so now i'm a little terrified of rebooting.
Feb 12 19:15:43 <linuxmodder>	what did you change before the grub2-mkconfig ?
Feb 12 19:16:20 <elagost>	run 'dnf list --installed|grep kernel' and see if you removed your kernels somehow?
Feb 12 19:16:57 <atrus>	added an option to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=, "systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0" i believe
Feb 12 19:17:07 <atrus>	linuxmodder: ^
Feb 12 19:18:12 <linuxmodder>	might try removing them all and rebuild, then add one at a time
Feb 12 19:18:27 <atrus>	since the /etc/default/grub file is back the way it was -- i'm not sure if my change actually was related to this not working right any more.
Feb 12 19:20:37 <atrus>	so the only option currently in GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX is: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.luks.uuid=luks-c1fe26fd-6da3-4c85-a28f-5ddb7ad7c5a7 rhgb quiet
Feb 12 19:20:59 <atrus>	(with a double-quote at the end i missed copying :p
Feb 12 19:21:03 <atrus>	)
Feb 12 19:22:26 <cmurf>	ComputerKid: hi, yes i do it all the time, doing it right now in fact
Feb 12 19:23:16 <cmurf>	there are multiple strategies but about the least complicated so far: https://paste.centos.org/view/fe27d9b8
Feb 12 19:24:16 <cmurf>	all the file systems are shared between f33 and f34, the 'home' subvolume is also shared
Feb 12 19:24:54 <cmurf>	and it's the BLS snippet in /boot/loader/entries that decides which subvol is mounted at /sysroot
Feb 12 19:26:14 <atrus>	linuxmodder: are you on an efi system? if so, does 'sudo grub2-mkconfig  | grep menuentry' show fedora entries for you? I'm wondering if i'm just running it wrong.
Feb 12 19:26:46 <cmurf>	atrus: it won't, they're not in grub.cfg anymore, they're snippets in /boot/loader/entries/
Feb 12 19:27:03 <atrus>	cmurf: aha
Feb 12 19:27:39 <linuxmodder>	atrus, [linuxmodder@workstation]~% sudo ls /boot/efi
Feb 12 19:27:39 <linuxmodder>	EFI  mach_kernel  System
Feb 12 19:27:49 <linuxmodder>	and one sec for the fpaste of grub2-mkconfig
Feb 12 19:27:57 <linuxmodder>	[linuxmodder@workstation]~% sudo ls /boot/efi
Feb 12 19:27:58 <linuxmodder>	EFI  mach_kernel  System
Feb 12 19:28:36 <atrus>	cmurf: thank you, i think this is the new information i was missing :) and thanks linuxmodder for helping me poke around too.
Feb 12 19:28:38 *	crankslider is now known as slidercrank
Feb 12 19:29:00 <cmurf>	also, just a heads up, feature in F34, grub.cfg will be in /boot/grub2 on both UEFI and BIOS
Feb 12 19:29:14 <atrus>	cmurf: NEAT.
Feb 12 19:30:28 <cmurf>	grub.cfg is intended to be static going forward, you won't need to recreate it unless something significant has changed, like file system or drive change
Feb 12 19:30:52 <elagost>	is it not now?
Feb 12 19:31:14 <cmurf>	it is now, since ~f31
Feb 12 19:31:50 <cmurf>	oops Fedora 30
Feb 12 19:32:12 <elagost>	So on new kernel installs we don't need to regenerate grub? How does that work?
Feb 12 19:33:05 <elagost>	in my understanding grub scans /boot for kernels and shows a menu based on that; is it dynamic these days?
Feb 12 19:33:07 <cmurf>	regenerating grub.cfg was never done on fedora since i can remember, grub2-mkconfig was one time at installation and from then on it was always modified by grubby using precise insertion and removal
Feb 12 19:34:11 <cmurf>	that grubby became grubby-deprecated in fedora 30, the grubby we have now is a shell script for some tasks folks may be familiar with like setting default kernel to boot instead of using e.g. grub2-set-default or grub2-editenv directly
Feb 12 19:34:39 <cmurf>	the grub.cfg still contains os-prober entries like Windows and non-Fedora OS's
Feb 12 19:35:21 <cmurf>	but there's a command in there, blscfg, that executes a GRUB module of the same name, which then parses the snippets in /boot/loader/entries and inserts them into the boot menu
Feb 12 19:36:30 <cmurf>	you can still change command line options in /etc/default/grub, and run grub2-mkconfig (with or without -o, doesn't matter) and part of that script will modify just the options line in each bls snippet
Feb 12 19:36:37 <cmurf>	it doesn't recreate the snippets from scratch
Feb 12 19:36:49 <elagost>	interesting. Haven't had to manually touch grub in a long time, just curious. Thanks for the info!
Feb 12 19:37:13 <elagost>	grub2-mkconfig without -o will appropriately find and update grub.cfg on both BIOS and UEFI systems then?
Feb 12 19:37:44 <cmurf>	no, if you do it without -o, it only modifies the command line options in bls snippets - whether BIOS or UEFI
Feb 12 19:38:10 <cmurf>	i know it's a bit confusing but you can just do it the way you have been
Feb 12 19:38:18 <cmurf>	there's nothing wrong with overwriting the grub.cfg
Feb 12 19:38:39 <cmurf>	but what's really happening when you change command line options is, the bls snippets get modified
Feb 12 19:39:37 <cmurf>	the bls snippets contain all knowledge about each boot entry, the grub.cfg is intended to be GRUB specific stuff
Feb 12 19:39:48 <cmurf>	where the BLS snippets are intended to be standardized across all bootloaders
Feb 12 19:44:22 <cmurf>	ComputerKid: if you're willing to hand edit the GRUB menu entry you can change rootflags=subvol=root34 to whatever subvol you want to boot (as root)
Feb 12 19:44:53 <cmurf>	so you can do it that way or create separate bls snippets for each subvolume you want to boot, give them their own title and whatever
Feb 12 19:45:33 <cmurf>	i have to tell you, it does get confusing to have two computers each with just f33 and f34 roots
Feb 12 19:46:43 <cmurf>	maybe it's just by short term memory :P but the other day i was like "wth! this bodhi update isn't available!" and as it turns out i was booted the wrong release versions and ... yeah
Feb 12 19:46:49 <cmurf>	s/by/my/
Feb 12 19:48:04 <cmurf>	the other tweaks i made that aren't critical, but nice, putting logs on their own subvolume means they always go forward instead of being rolled back
Feb 12 19:49:27 <cmurf>	and it is possible to share system flatpaks, the mere existence of /var/lib/flatpaks apparently populates the listing of apps in Activities *shrug* color me surprised
Feb 12 19:49:36 <rindolf>	Hi all! what can i do about this message on pidgin on fedora 33 x86-64: https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/images/pidgin--Screenshot_20201013_194807--cropped.png ; i tried 'deny', 'authorize' - nothing worked.
Feb 12 19:49:49 *	cmurf sneaks away
Feb 12 19:50:34 <cmurf>	oh d9k got a btrfs dev looking at ur bug, more later
Feb 12 20:03:09 <fmlatghor>	special device dose not exist? I'm trying mount something in a vg that I've activated
Feb 12 20:03:28 <fmlatghor>	`sudo mount /mnt/test /dev/fedora_server/root
Feb 12 20:03:37 <fmlatghor>	mount: /dev/mapper/fedora_server-root: special device /mnt/test does not exist.
Feb 12 20:13:01 <cmurf>	fmlatghor: reverse them
Feb 12 20:13:06 <fmlatghor>	thath didn't work either cmurf
Feb 12 20:13:10 <cmurf>	device first, mount point second
Feb 12 20:13:52 <cmurf>	does /mnt/test exist?
Feb 12 20:14:35 <fmlatghor>	cmurf: yes it does
Feb 12 20:16:15 <cmurf>	show the command you used and the error you get
Feb 12 20:18:28 <fmlatghor>	no wait it didn't exist. I thought it did. I created the wrong dir in /mnt thanks cmurf
Feb 12 20:18:58 <fmlatghor>	ah yes now I can get all my data
Feb 12 20:20:24 <cmurf>	i named a snapshot yesterday root34.tets and got confused why booting root34.test faceplanted, :P

Feb 12 20:22:20 <dbristow>	cmurf: I just tested a preliminary F34 CINN image and called it MATE by mistake.
Feb 12 20:25:41 <d9k>	cmurf: nice, and thanks

Feb 12 21:29:10 <sdgathman>	I ran system-upgrade from f30->f32, and everything worked fine, except it still boots the old kernel.  grubby --info=DEFAULT shows the new kernel, but that is not what boots...
Feb 12 21:30:27 <sdgathman>	I'm pretty sure the problem is that /etc/default/grub has GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=false
Feb 12 21:30:45 <sdgathman>	But the system-upgrade can't seem to deal with that.
Feb 12 21:31:06 <sdgathman>	And grubby can't seem to deal with it.
Feb 12 21:31:26 <sdgathman>	So how do I convert to the New Fedora Way ?
Feb 12 21:32:30 <sdgathman>	The system-upgrade didn't even touch /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Feb 12 21:33:59 <cmurf>	d9k msg me your name and email address if you want to be listed as the reporter on this bug
Feb 12 21:34:30 <cmurf>	turns out it's a false alarm by the tree checker
Feb 12 21:36:58 <d9k>	there was a bug too
Feb 12 21:37:05 <d9k>	or warning
Feb 12 21:37:28 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-H7V.txt
Feb 12 21:39:04 <cmurf>	d9k: i never saw that call trace, same reproducer?
Feb 12 21:39:10 <d9k>	yes
Feb 12 21:39:10 <cmurf>	or different one
Feb 12 21:39:12 <cmurf>	ok
Feb 12 21:40:12 <cmurf>	so that enospc fallout might've been fixed in 5.11-rc1, i'll forward it and we'll check
Feb 12 21:41:54 <sdgathman>	I manually added the new kernel to grub.cfg as the default.  It boots
Feb 12 21:44:04 <cmurf>	sdgathman: it's confusing
Feb 12 21:45:22 <cmurf>	sdgathman: do you have /boot/loader/entries/*.conf files that match up with each fedora menu entry?
Feb 12 21:46:09 <cmurf>	if the convert script failed for some reason, there may not be a conf per installed kernel, so the options are (a) ignore it and just use the current working one (b) fix it manually at the bls snippet level (c) reinstall the kernels and it'll create the bls entries
Feb 12 21:46:34 <cmurf>	but there is an order to do things in: /etc/default/grub GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true
Feb 12 21:46:47 <cmurf>	then grub2-install (this is BIOS only)
Feb 12 21:47:11 <cmurf>	then grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (also BIOS only currently)
Feb 12 21:47:36 <cmurf>	but then we need to look at 'sudo grub2-editenv list' and make sure that grubenv is ok

Feb 12 21:53:01 <sdgathman>	I'll be testing the multiple location part when we move whenever I get a new job.
Feb 12 21:53:22 <sdgathman>	Then I'll have another FedoraMagazine article or so. :-)
Feb 12 21:55:13 <cmurf>	sdgathman: yeah so there's a f34 feature to consolidate the configs so that it's possible for installations to be booted either EFI or BIOS
Feb 12 21:55:47 <cmurf>	basically make the ESP partition contain static info, with a "stub" grub.cfg that merely forwards to the real one at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Feb 12 22:01:53 <cmurf>	d9k awesome job on the btrfs bug report, made it super easy to figure out what was wrong and a fix, and looks like there will be an xfstest based on this exposed bug
Feb 12 22:02:03 <cmurf>	so it's gonna end up making btrfs and xfs better :)
Feb 12 22:03:11 <cockingbird_cage>	Could you please tell me the differences between btrfs and zfs?
Feb 12 22:03:28 <d9k>	i did try that on xfs and it does some funny stuff too, https://0x0.st/iO5c.txt
Feb 12 22:03:45 <d9k>	couldnt get it to crash
Feb 12 22:04:29 <cmurf>	cockingbird_cage: that would take a long time, so no, sorry - lots of historical info on their development on various lists and videos from the developers themselves instead of depending on people such as myself to give a hearsay story
Feb 12 22:04:49 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/iOAe.txt, the space goes up and down, if you get it just right you get ENOSPC until you delete a little and write alot
Feb 12 22:05:05 <cmurf>	cockingbird_cage: so i mean, if you can be more specific i'll answer but that question is too open ended
Feb 12 22:05:21 <cmurf>	d9k: oooo
Feb 12 22:06:12 <cmurf>	d9k: you're getting enospc on xfs also?
Feb 12 22:06:22 <cmurf>	but no call trace
Feb 12 22:06:55 <d9k>	no call trace
Feb 12 22:07:11 <cmurf>	but that's on xfs
Feb 12 22:07:14 <d9k>	yes
Feb 12 22:07:56 <d9k>	you can see what it does when it works correctly? on the second paste
Feb 12 22:09:53 <cmurf>	forwarded, he also works on xfs
Feb 12 22:10:19 <d9k>	shared extents are a great feature, but apparently very tricky to get right
Feb 12 22:10:31 <cmurf>	cockingbird_cage: I can tell you what's in common though, what goes moo?!
Feb 12 22:11:36 <cmurf>	d9k this particular issue in btrfs is tree checker just doing something wrong, when the patch lands you'll see it and you'll understand it better than i will
Feb 12 22:11:50 <cmurf>	reflinks are fundamental in btrfs since day 1
Feb 12 22:12:37 <cmurf>	xfs had to be taught datacow before it could do reflinks so it was more work in many ways
Feb 12 22:15:48 <cockingbird_cage>	Very well then tell me what they have in common. Much appreciated.
Feb 12 22:17:18 <cockingbird_cage>	cmurf: I heard that one does not need RAIDs anymore...

Feb 13 08:24:42 <jollyrogue[m]>	Is there a way to add accounts with ssh keys to the Fedora cloud image? I keep finding stuff suggesting cloud-init.
Feb 13 08:25:34 <toxane>	jollyrogue[m]: does "ssh-copy-id" not work for you?
Feb 13 08:26:48 <jollyrogue[m]>	I'm sure it will work once I get the system booted, and I can login.

Feb 13 09:35:30 <toxane>	then you might have to look in the manual how to adjust height, width, etc.
Feb 13 09:36:37 <toxane>	maybe it has an "auto adjust" feature

Feb 13 19:32:02 <[R]>	khaytsus: where is the option to configure the network in the fedora installer?
Feb 13 19:32:29 <Khaytsus>	[R]: Ananconda GUI?  Same screen with disk setup etc
Feb 13 19:32:30 <Khaytsus>	I must be misunderstanding the question
Feb 13 19:32:54 <[R]>	all i see is Keyboard, Installation Destination, and Time & Date
Feb 13 19:33:18 <[R]>	there used to be more options...
Feb 13 19:33:47 <Khaytsus>	hmm, maybe I've missed that change, booting a vm
Feb 13 19:34:45 <Khaytsus>	i wish I could ifgure out why xfce VM's always screw up my bluetooth connection..  it's like it changes the BT profile, I don't even know what's going on
Feb 13 19:34:49 <Khaytsus>	anywho
Feb 13 19:35:16 <Khaytsus>	Nope, "network & hostname"
Feb 13 19:35:19 <[R]>	wtf...

Feb 13 19:35:47 <Khaytsus>	Yep
Feb 13 19:35:47 <[R]>	i'm just using the default iso
Feb 13 19:35:54 <[R]>	lemme take a screenshot
Feb 13 19:36:02 <Khaytsus>	33 xfce spin
Feb 13 19:36:45 <Khaytsus>	All the spins should look the same, server and gnome are both unique
Feb 13 19:37:22 <[R]>	khaytsus: https://imgur.com/a/oZhaIhb
Feb 13 19:37:46 <Khaytsus>	so yeah guhngnome.. let me look
Feb 13 19:39:07 <[R]>	the documentation clearly shows more options...
Feb 13 19:39:27 <[R]>	although it also shows a "fedora server" banner
Feb 13 19:39:58 <Khaytsus>	I suppose it doesn't need to be online during install anyway does it?
Feb 13 19:40:22 <[R]>	i wanted to set like hostname and such
Feb 13 19:40:34 <[R]>	i got it installed and realized i missed settin the hostnam,e so i booted back to the installer, and its no where to be found
Feb 13 19:41:30 <Southern_Gentlem>	nope [R] thats gnome
Feb 13 19:41:46 <Southern_Gentlem>	you can do it in gnome settings IIRC
Feb 13 19:41:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	[R], and hopefully you used the updated iso
Feb 13 19:41:59 <[R]>	that's a little silly
Feb 13 19:42:07 <[R]>	no, i used the relesae one
Feb 13 19:42:10 <[R]>	had like 5000 updates
Feb 13 19:42:10 <[R]>	haha

Feb 13 21:31:17 <_AnK>	Hello. Q:  Some few years ago I moved from NVIDIA to AMD graphics card to avoid 'black screen' every time kernel is upgraded and NVIDIA driver packages are not yet available. I wonder what is the situation these days i.e. is it still a problem or NVIDIA drivers are readily available. Thanks.
Feb 13 21:31:19 <Southern_Gentlem>	akik if you really need it i can put it where you can get it
Feb 13 21:31:41 <akik>	Southern_Gentlem: ok thanks
Feb 13 21:31:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	Ank thus you use the nvidia from rpmfusion and it builds for you each kernel
Feb 13 21:32:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	with their akmod-nvidia
Feb 13 21:32:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	you may have to reboot 2x with the kenrel update
Feb 13 21:32:31 <_AnK>	yes - that was i was doing. But there was a delay - sometime few weeks ...
Feb 13 21:32:39 <_AnK>	Is it sttill a problem?
Feb 13 21:32:43 <_AnK>	stil
Feb 13 21:33:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	how is there a delay if its building when you boot the new kernel
Feb 13 21:33:15 <_AnK>	dynamically?
Feb 13 21:33:31 <Southern_Gentlem>	i havent had issues with nvidia driver for years
Feb 13 21:33:38 <_AnK>	Excellent.
Feb 13 21:33:39 <_AnK>	Thanks
Feb 13 21:33:51 <Southern_Gentlem>	if you use the rpmfusion nvidia drivers
Feb 13 21:33:58 <_AnK>	Yes, i will.
Feb 13 21:34:04 <_AnK>	akmod - i remenmber
Feb 13 21:34:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	_Ank take a look at " http://rpmfusion.org/Howto/nVidia?highlight=_Ank8CategoryHowto_Ank9 "

Feb 13 23:38:29 <hdost3[m]>	So I figured out the issue there' needs to be another selinux policy added for systemservices in snapd. Which package is typically responsible for that? I looked here: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/selinux-policy/tree/rawhide it doesn't appear to be there
Feb 13 23:38:50 <hdost3[m]>	The issue is only in rawhide to my knowledge, but I was hoping to get a patch in for it

Feb 14 16:11:50 <_AnK>	Hello. Where can i read more about how to connect wireless speakers to my Fedora 33 PC ? What is hardware and software requirements?
Feb 14 16:16:49 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to Khaytsus
Feb 14 16:16:49 *	Khaytsus has kicked luciandesozay_ri from #fedora (Stop that)
Feb 14 16:16:49 *	Khaytsus removes channel operator status from Khaytsus
Feb 14 16:17:30 <Khaytsus>	_AnK: Wireless how?  Bluetooth generally just works, I use it on multiple headsets here daily.
Feb 14 16:19:57 <_AnK>	Understood. Thinking to buy a bluetooth speakers was wondering how difficult it would be to hook them up. Apparently i alread have the packages installed. SO should be no problem. Thanks.
Feb 14 16:20:58 <_AnK>	But i guess i need bluetooth adapter. Any suggestions?
Feb 14 16:21:09 <Khaytsus>	Nope, it'll just work.  Put them in pairing mode and look for them in your bluetooth manager of choice.  Use pavucontrol to set your outputs to them.
Feb 14 16:21:28 <_AnK>	ok. Will try. Thanks.
Feb 14 16:21:38 <Khaytsus>	Any that work in Linux.  I just look on Amazon for it.
Feb 14 16:22:38 <Khaytsus>	https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1VJHVD/    this I so far have NOT had good luck with, however.  It works but everything defaults to the lowest quality and I can't seem to change it.
Feb 14 16:22:42 <_AnK>	My confusion coming from misunderstanding what hardware piece needs to be present to catch the bluetooth signal.
Feb 14 16:23:00 <_AnK>	Thanks for the link
Feb 14 16:23:02 <_AnK>	:-)
Feb 14 16:23:17 <Khaytsus>	Sure you need a bluetooth radio on your computer...  it might even be built-in.  Or just buy one, they're cheap.
Feb 14 16:23:39 <_AnK>	I do not know how to check for it
Feb 14 16:23:44 <Khaytsus>	Check what?
Feb 14 16:24:18 <Khaytsus>	You could also get a 3.5mm bluetooth "transmitter" which plugs in the normal 3.5mm audio jack
Feb 14 16:24:26 <Khaytsus>	And no worries of bluetooth compatability at all
Feb 14 16:27:01 <_AnK>	By Cheking - i meant what if i already have in in motherboard (?) or else and just do not know.... Thanks for the advise. I have somthing to think about now
Feb 14 16:27:18 <Khaytsus>	I wish they made more that had no battery in them, however, but i guess most people would want them with a battery.  I have a few audio devices that I'd like to "convert" to bluetooth and don't want to have something charging 24/7 but it is what it is.
Feb 14 16:27:35 <Khaytsus>	_AnK: Just go to your blueooth manager and look.. if you have a bluetooth adaptor it'll show up
Feb 14 16:27:51 <Khaytsus>	Do a scan, it'll likely see something unless you live in the middle of nowhere
Feb 14 16:28:12 <_AnK>	I did, It shows none. But I may have disabled it from BIOS. I need to check that too. Thanks
Feb 14 16:28:44 <_AnK>	Some learning curve for me ....
Feb 14 16:30:03 <Khaytsus>	My motherboard here supports it, but I don't have the PCI slot bits that have the antenna and some other stuff so it shows up as a controller but it does nothing..
Feb 14 16:30:35 <_AnK>	How did you check for it  , pls?
Feb 14 16:30:42 <Khaytsus>	So I have a dongle which works but seems to be off the market anymore
Feb 14 16:30:48 <Khaytsus>	It shows up in my bluetooth manager, like I said
Feb 14 16:30:53 <_AnK>	i see
Feb 14 16:31:02 <_AnK>	understood
Feb 14 16:31:10 <Khaytsus>	hciconfig -a
Feb 14 16:31:13 <Khaytsus>	etc
Feb 14 16:31:41 <_AnK>	hciconfig -a shows nothing for me.
Feb 14 16:31:55 <_AnK>	I guess i have non internally.
Feb 14 16:32:40 <_AnK>	I will check the BIOS also. I recall i switched off something related to bluetooth over there.
Feb 14 16:32:53 <_AnK>	Thanks alot

Feb 14 19:19:52 <cation21>	hi, what is the best place for me to report an issue I think might be related to the kernel? I am running Fedora 32 on my desktop with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU, and my system started rebooting several minutes after boot since I upgraded from kernel 5.10.8-100 to 5.10.12-100 (and I have the same issue with 5.10.15-100)
Feb 14 19:20:42 <cation21>	I think it might be the kernel because I do not encounter the issue when I boot back into 5.10.8-100

Feb 14 20:37:01 <johrpan>	I found minge64-meson, but it seems to have a different command line by default.

Feb 16 11:12:39 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	I'm having a problem when I set the volume on my Fedora 33 it doesn't change instantly but there's a slight delay
Feb 16 11:12:39 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	It doesn't occur on speakers, only on headphones :/

Feb 16 12:24:54 <herlimenezes>	Hello, good morning/evening/night! I'm trying to install Fedora 33, in an AMD Ryzen 5 machine with 120GB in a SSD and 1TB in the HDD. My idea is to use SSD for SO and HDD for programs and data. What is the best solution?
Feb 16 12:28:35 <[Enrico]>	herlimenezes: static bind mounts of the HDD in the selected mount points where you put the data you want in the HDD
Feb 16 12:28:54 <[Enrico]>	you can put /home on the HDD for example
Feb 16 12:29:15 <[Enrico]>	of keep your home fairly clean by default and create a mount in /hdd
Feb 16 12:42:44 <herlimenezes>	Ty, [Enrico]. Excuse me, but I never did that and I am unsure on how to to it. Since I have no data in HDD, I can reinstall F33.
Feb 16 12:57:40 <yates>	i am using oracle virtualbox to run an lubuntu 18.04.5 LTS in guest os under fedora 32 and i cannot get the shared clipboard (bidirectional) to work
Feb 16 12:57:50 <yates>	is this ai known issue?

Feb 16 23:12:38 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	Is it possible that I cannot share my screen on Discord, because I've installed it from Flatpak?
Feb 16 23:13:10 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	I can only share a few select programs (almost all of them are other Flatpak apps)
Feb 16 23:13:46 <dowdle>	davetoo: Using containers I would imagine.  While multiple versions of PHP are available (I think) via modules, you can only have one version installed at a time.
Feb 16 23:14:19 <Dustin[m]>	That is probably related to Wayland
Feb 16 23:14:49 <Dustin[m]>	0xdeadcat: I believe that it's still not quite working with Wayland but is fixed in the next releases
Feb 16 23:15:12 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	Oh... I see
Feb 16 23:15:21 <Dustin[m]>	I believe that's the case
Feb 16 23:15:44 <Dustin[m]>	I tested screen sharing using Jitsi Meet and it is indeed not working for full screen share
Feb 16 23:15:49 <Dustin[m]>	Only windows
Feb 16 23:16:03 <Dustin[m]>	But Fedora 34 and GNOME 40 are supposed to have that all fixed and working perfectly
Feb 16 23:17:26 <drakonan2>	What is the reason for the /run dir?!?!?!
Feb 16 23:18:14 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	I was thinking it's because of Flatpak, because when I installed CLion through it, I couldn't use OpenOCD for instance (even though the path was correct and I had it installed) ¯_ (ツ)_/¯
Feb 16 23:18:22 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	Dustin:
Feb 16 23:18:26 <M0xdeadcat[m]>	That's great to hear
Feb 16 23:20:14 <dowdle>	drakonan2: Some stuff is stored under there.  For example, most removable media is automounted somewhere under /run by default by the GUI desktop environments.  /run definitely isn't Fedora specific
Feb 16 23:24:07 <dowdle>	drakonan2: /var/run is a symlink to /run so... whatever /var/run was used for. :)
Feb 16 23:25:11 <drakonan2>	just trying to understand between ubuntu/fedora establish situational awareness since my first thought when i saw that was i was on the livecd heh
Feb 16 23:32:51 <drakonan2>	dowdle, just confusing since i went to /media which existed... no telling how much time i wasted there
Feb 16 23:33:49 <vwbusguy[m]>	drakonan2: `man hier` is helpful for understanding what the top level directories are for
Feb 16 23:37:00 <yuriLoki>	Hey guys , installed fedora on my laptop and my microphone (the one that comes in the headset) is not detected ...
Feb 16 23:37:10 <yuriLoki>	My laptop is running a single jack
Feb 16 23:37:56 <yuriLoki>	Is there any thing I can do ? I already tried following a bazilion of old answers on stack overflow. Any help would be appreciated
Feb 16 23:38:22 <dowdle>	drakonan2: Yeah, so there's /mnt, /media, and now stuff under /run/
Feb 16 23:38:53 <dowdle>	drakonan2: If your desktop mounts it for you automatically they generally put an icon on the desktop or provide a specific way to get to it in your graphical file manager.

Feb 20 20:15:16 <davidfetter>	hi
Feb 20 20:16:13 <davidfetter>	is there a way to get xdg-open (or something similar) to choose among only terminal-based applications for opening a file/url?
Feb 20 20:17:52 <davidfetter>	I tried setting $DISPLAY to an empty string, but that failed pretty hard
Feb 20 20:18:28 <[R]>	huh?
Feb 20 20:20:49 <Khaytsus>	I think xdg-open implies GUI apps, at least that's all I've ever seen it used for
Feb 20 20:21:08 <bagira>	davidfetter, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/257158/change-default-web-browser-to-lynx-from-terminal
Feb 20 20:21:40 <bagira>	you just use the execute switch against your favorite term in the Exec line
Feb 20 20:21:55 <Khaytsus>	I think he wants to use xdg-open all the time, console or GUI.   NOt just "change web browser to lynx"
Feb 20 20:22:17 <Khaytsus>	xdg-open in console on a text file, vi..  in X11, gedit.. or whatever
Feb 20 20:22:27 <bagira>	right, this will do that
Feb 20 20:22:49 <Khaytsus>	um..  k
Feb 20 20:29:18 <mkoncek>	i am using Fedora 33, (Lenovo T480S) for quite some time i am noticing very sporadic (once per hour) screen flickering, like 5 flickers of slight brithness change, then returns to normal. Afaik this happens both on the laptop screen as well as external screen connected via HDMI
Feb 20 20:30:13 <mkoncek>	it is mostly visible when the screen background is white
Feb 20 20:30:56 <bagira>	going to be a driver or hardware issue
Feb 20 20:32:58 <bagira>	davidfetter, Khaytsus i apologize, i missed something in that answer...xdg-mime is also needed there: https://askubuntu.com/questions/62585/how-do-i-set-a-new-xdg-open-setting
Feb 20 20:34:00 <mkoncek>	i did some basic search, like this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1146236/intel-hd-520-graphics-flickering-screen
Feb 20 20:34:34 <mkoncek>	how do enries in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ work?
Feb 20 20:34:50 <mkoncek>	add an entry, then reboot for it to take effect?
Feb 20 20:34:57 <bagira>	or restart X
Feb 20 20:35:13 <mkoncek>	are all entries read? does the name matter?
Feb 20 20:35:36 <bagira>	the names are arbitrary, but, use something you'll remember what it is by reading it
Feb 20 20:35:56 <bagira>	most of that is to signal to you that you did something 2 years later when you're troubleshooting and forgot you did this lol
Feb 20 20:36:20 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to fedbot
Feb 20 20:36:24 <mkoncek>	yeah, definitely
Feb 20 20:37:26 <bagira>	imo they shouldn't have split it up into multiple files like that....X11 configuration has changed alot over the last 10 years or so
Feb 20 20:38:02 <mkoncek>	someone other suggested playing around with Compositor
Feb 20 20:38:15 <mkoncek>	vsync -> Full screen repaints
Feb 20 20:38:17 <bagira>	which one are you using?
Feb 20 20:38:42 <mkoncek>	i have been using KDE, automatic...
Feb 20 20:38:48 <bagira>	and does it happen when you're not running th compositor?
Feb 20 20:38:51 <mkoncek>	opengl 3.1
Feb 20 20:39:07 <mkoncek>	i am only ever running GUI, so i can't tell
Feb 20 20:39:30 <mkoncek>	and it happens so infrequently that i cannot wait around to see it
Feb 20 20:39:35 <bagira>	try running xfce for a while with no compositor, they're usually an external binary to the DE, couldn't comment on kde
Feb 20 20:39:42 <bagira>	if it still happens, it's not the compositor
Feb 20 20:39:53 <bagira>	but it's not the compositor
Feb 20 20:40:00 <mkoncek>	i mean, i can disable compositor also in KDE
Feb 20 20:40:38 <bagira>	would be a good way to rule out the compositor
Feb 20 20:40:47 <cmurf>	linuxmodder: geeky_gecko[m] what do you want to know?
Feb 20 20:41:10 <mkoncek>	well, the page says "screen tearing" that is different
Feb 20 20:41:19 <cmurf>	e.g. my remote backup command looks like
Feb 20 20:41:26 <cmurf>	sudo btrfs send -p home.20210126 home.20210218 | ssh chris@fnuc.local "sudo btrfs receive /srv/scratch/backups/flap/"
Feb 20 20:42:32 <cmurf>	i have ssh pki setup, and also on the remote server that user chris has a sudoers.d dropin file
Feb 20 20:43:16 <mkoncek>	also, why is there xorg.conf.d both in /etc/X11 as well as in /usr/share/X11?
Feb 20 20:43:18 <cmurf>	cat /etc/sudoers.d/1chris    chris ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/btrfs
Feb 20 20:45:21 <bagira>	mkoncek, developer arbitration but there are some hints as to why in `man hier`
Feb 20 20:46:27 <mkoncek>	well, i should know that...
Feb 20 20:46:46 <mkoncek>	btw. Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620 (rev 07)
Feb 20 20:51:48 <mkoncek>	also, i am using Redlight provided by KDE
Feb 20 20:52:01 <mkoncek>	many things where the problem could be hidden
Feb 20 20:52:15 <bagira>	it's almost certainly a hardware or driver issue
Feb 20 20:53:32 <mkoncek>	unfortunately
Feb 20 20:53:39 <bagira>	i would try those xorg device options where others have had some success in case it can be accounted for.  the intel drivers are "bad".
Feb 20 20:54:06 <bagira>	s/drivers/chips/
Feb 20 20:55:02 <mkoncek>	really? i was under the impression that intel gpus work pretty well on linux
Feb 20 20:55:36 <bagira>	ive never had one i didn't have some tweaking necessary due to glitches just like you're describing
Feb 20 20:57:06 <bagira>	mkoncek, btw do you have xorg-x11-drv-intel installed?
Feb 20 20:57:20 <mkoncek>	(it just happened again)
Feb 20 20:58:24 <mkoncek>	yes, xorg-x11-drv-intel-2.99.917-48.20200205.fc33.src.rpm
Feb 20 20:58:40 <bagira>	ok
Feb 20 21:00:33 <mkoncek>	i will try restarting X
Feb 20 21:01:00 <mkoncek>	unfortunately KDE does not play well with systemctl restart display-manager
Feb 20 21:01:27 <davidfetter>	Khaytsus, bagira, sorry, got called away by kid duty. Maybe I didn't quite explain it. Let's imagine I've logged into a terminal on a box that doesn't have a GUI installed at all. There are lots of terminal-based programs it's possible to open files with, some using very clever ASCII art renderings.
Feb 20 21:02:07 <davidfetter>	I want to arrange it so I'm only choosing among those options, but only sometimes.
Feb 20 21:02:08 <mkoncek>	chafa
Feb 20 21:02:22 <bagira>	davidfetter, https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-mime should do what you're describing
Feb 20 21:03:06 <davidfetter>	bagira, not quite. When I do have a setting for $DISPLAY, I'll get the GUI app whether I wanted it or not. I only want it sometimes.
Feb 20 21:05:28 <mkoncek>	so basically i tried: 1) use that config from askubuntu, 2) disable compositor 3) disable Redlight
Feb 20 21:05:33 <davidfetter>	bagira, there doesn't appear to be anything in the xdg ecosystem, or at least I haven't found anything, that says, "use the non-GUI choices even when GUI choices exist"
Feb 20 21:05:43 <mkoncek>	i am getting blinded by the bright light
Feb 20 21:05:55 <bagira>	davidfetter, im not sure i understand your use case now.  you want xdg-open 'file:///|http[s]://$path' to open urls and files in a terminal, lynx for example for urls and vim for example for files right?
Feb 20 21:06:37 <bagira>	davidfetter, if that's what you want, then your preferred applications need to be set using the first link, and your mimes need to be set using the second link
Feb 20 21:06:56 <davidfetter>	bagira, I know xdg-open doesn't have this, but what I want it along the lines of xdg-open --no-gui [gizmo]
Feb 20 21:07:10 <bagira>	oh you want to have ad-hoc selection of gui or not
Feb 20 21:07:16 <davidfetter>	exactly :)
Feb 20 21:07:28 <bagira>	i have no idea and im interested in what you find out
Feb 20 21:08:17 <davidfetter>	thanks :)
Feb 20 21:08:55 <mkoncek>	till this day, i still don't know what the compositor does
Feb 20 21:08:55 <s34n>	sshd allows me to sftp with a key sometimes, but requires a password other times
Feb 20 21:09:13 <bagira>	davidfetter, i know xdg-open will cycle through associated 'openers' in succession, so, for example `xdg-open /` on my machine will cycle through www-browser,links2,elinks,lynx,w3m in succession
Feb 20 21:09:34 <s34n>	The difference is if I change the ChrootDirectory
Feb 20 21:09:44 <s34n>	why would that affect authentication?
Feb 20 21:09:56 <bagira>	davidfetter, if no native xdg feature is found you could write a wrapper script that chooses based on whether DISPLAY is set?
Feb 20 21:10:06 <davidfetter>	"cycle," as in the next call to it will use the next one in the loop of apps?
Feb 20 21:10:29 <bagira>	davidfetter, no it'll oscillate through associated openers with that type until it finds one
Feb 20 21:10:38 <bagira>	s/oscillate/iterate
Feb 20 21:11:12 <bagira>	i need coffee and my uvula is swollen; brb
Feb 20 21:11:16 <davidfetter>	so until there's an option earlier on the list, it'll always hit the same on, though
Feb 20 21:11:25 <bagira>	correct
Feb 20 21:11:35 <davidfetter>	one*
Feb 20 21:12:03 *	tnewman9 is now known as tnewman
Feb 20 21:15:03 <bagira>	davidfetter, for example, here's output from xdg-open on my netflix-ish kiosk in the living room: http://paste.silogroup.org/uxivipaviy | it'll cycle through that list until it finds one or fail if none of them are there
Feb 20 21:15:55 <bagira>	i think you can bypass that behaviour by setting them all to a wrapper script and then having the wrapper script do some alternative routing based on whether $DISPLAY is set
Feb 20 21:16:59 <bagira>	or better you could have a wrapper for just that mime type, so, urls get a url wrapper/router, files get one, etc that way you don't lose all the miming xdg provides
Feb 20 21:17:05 <s34n>	And why won't ChrootDirectory %h allow me to authenticate at all?
Feb 20 21:18:39 <bagira>	s34n, strong recommendation to use vsftpd
Feb 20 21:22:13 <s34n>	bagira: how you sftp with vsftp?
Feb 20 21:23:10 <bagira>	s34n, old link but first google result: https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-and-configure-vsftpd-on-fedora-20/ | steps should still work fine
Feb 20 21:25:13 <bagira>	also if you're using sftp in 2021 you probably have better options available
Feb 20 21:25:14 <davidfetter>	TIL: vsftpd can be configured to require TLS
Feb 20 21:25:35 <bagira>	there are few good reasons to use it these days
Feb 20 21:26:34 <davidfetter>	on the client side, I use lftp sftp://
Feb 20 21:28:05 <Khaytsus>	I have a printer that scans to ftp and inside my lan I still feel dirty
Feb 20 21:28:51 <davidfetter>	Khaytsus, is there a way to configure the printer so it doesn't do that?
Feb 20 21:29:43 <Khaytsus>	davidfetter: Use dumb windows-only software, or scan to ftp.  Those are the options.
Feb 20 21:30:53 <davidfetter>	Khaytsus, that's a shame. I don't suppose that windows-only software gets in touch with it via a network protocol that something else could use...
Feb 20 21:31:10 <Khaytsus>	Never looked..  it's fine.
Feb 20 21:31:52 <davidfetter>	Just out of curiosity, which printer is it?
Feb 20 21:34:02 *	davidfetter has occasional flashes of paranoia about the IoT devices he didn't know were IoT in his house that he sees on his LAN
Feb 20 21:34:13 <bagira>	as you should
Feb 20 21:35:49 <davidfetter>	"WhyTF is the thermostat trying to get on the WiFi?"
Feb 20 21:36:24 <davidfetter>	"What would it do if it succeeded?"
Feb 20 21:36:53 <bagira>	if you ever want to get real scared, put your phone on an isolated lan and watch the traffic
Feb 20 21:37:14 <akik>	fedora recognizes my external display. springdale el8 doesn't. what's the magic?
Feb 20 21:37:45 <bagira>	akik, sounds like a RHEL question
Feb 20 21:37:57 <akik>	could it be some nvidia thing as this laptop has it
Feb 20 21:40:15 <bagira>	is anyone aware of a channel for fedRAMP dicusssions?
Feb 20 21:41:57 <Khaytsus>	My air fryer wants to get on the wifi so the 80 meg app can sent out a notification when the thing finishes, as if the BEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEP BEEEEEEEEEEEP isn't enough.  #howaboutno
Feb 20 21:43:18 <bagira>	lol would be cool if you could make it post your food on facebook too
Feb 20 21:43:38 <Khaytsus>	davidfetter: Older Brother.  The email option was super flakey, forgot it had that..  I tried to use it and it randomly timed out on big scans.
Feb 20 21:46:39 <davidfetter>	Khaytsus, sounds like it's got a pretty large attack surface :/
Feb 20 21:53:07 <Khaytsus>	davidfetter: From who, me?
Feb 20 21:53:16 <Khaytsus>	It's in my lan.
Feb 20 22:01:02 <akik>	ok it was some modeset difference since the last install. set nouveau.modeset=1 and i915.modeset=0 and now the external display works

Feb 22 14:35:01 <Southern_Gentlem>	Anvil, ssds but doing good, still making the updated isos etc
Feb 22 14:35:52 <bendem>	I see repoquery is supposed to have "--weak-requires", but running it, I get "dnf repoquery: error: unrecognized arguments: --weak-requires"
Feb 22 14:39:13 <Khaytsus>	bendem: Where?  NOthing in the man page

Feb 22 14:40:17 <Khaytsus>	... no
Feb 22 14:40:34 <bendem>	I also see install-weakdep is supposed to be a thing in https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingDrafts/WeakDependencies

Feb 22 14:46:16 <bendem>	I'm not sure how I can make the question clearer
Feb 22 14:47:47 <bendem>	what I'm saying is, there used to be an obvious way, there isn't anymore and the internet is not helping, thus, I'm asking here
Feb 22 14:47:55 <Khaytsus>	bendem: Your questions have been "why is this 15 year old man page not matching current"
Feb 22 14:48:17 <bendem>	Khaytsus, 14:34:01 <bendem> how can I list the weak dependencies of a package I have installed?

Feb 22 14:49:28 *	Khaytsus &
Feb 22 14:49:38 <Southern_Gentlem>	bendem,  i am not seeing a way to list weak deps only all deps
Feb 22 14:50:00 <FranciscoD>	For an installed package, one should be able to use --recomments/--suggests
Feb 22 14:50:05 <FranciscoD>	s/recomments/recommends/
Feb 22 14:50:09 <FranciscoD>	with rpm, that is
Feb 22 14:50:13 <FranciscoD>	man rpm has them
Feb 22 14:50:49 <FranciscoD>	for a package that isn't installed, I'd expect dnf repoquery to match these options too
Feb 22 14:51:10 <FranciscoD>	man dnf lists them, so yeh
Feb 22 14:52:31 <bendem>	what's the relationship between recommends/suggests and weak? I thought they were separate concepts, but I'm not so sure now
Feb 22 14:53:00 <FranciscoD>	bendem: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/WeakDependencies/
Feb 22 14:53:26 <FranciscoD>	they're types of weak deps: forward/backwared
Feb 22 14:53:30 <FranciscoD>	s/backwared/backward/
Feb 22 14:53:58 <bendem>	ok, that makes sense
Feb 22 14:54:32 <bendem>	ah, I see, Suggests is actually just part of the spec, it's ignored by dnf
Feb 22 14:54:45 <bendem>	thanks FranciscoD

Feb 22 15:00:12 <mkoncek>	i still cannot figure out the weird behaviour of wine graphical applications: my keyboard key 2 is registered as 6 and 6 is not registered at all, this happens both with my laptop keyboard as well as my external keyboard
Feb 22 15:01:06 <Southern_Gentlem>	mkoncek,  i saw a bunch of wine updates this morning
Feb 22 15:02:14 <mkoncek>	i mean, i am having this for 2 years...
Feb 22 15:03:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	and you havent complained until now
Feb 22 15:03:17 <Khaytsus>	A quick google says "wrong keyboard layout" in Wine, whatever that means..  can one set a keyboard layout in Wine?  (people stil use Wine??)
Feb 22 15:04:07 <Khaytsus>	https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30984    similar issue
Feb 22 15:08:19 <mkoncek>	i did once somewhere on wine channel, but did not find help... whar is their channel again?
Feb 22 15:09:11 <mkoncek>	speaking of wine, i constantly have to exclude wine-dxvk from dnf updates because it breaks 3D applications

Feb 22 15:40:30 <_AnK>	Hello. On FC33 I am running Windows 10 virtual  qemu/kvm. Got new monitor with higher resolution. Win10 stuck on the low resolution mode. I thought it is as easy as downloading Win10 driver and installing it in virtual pc. But no - installer refusing to install as it  sees Spice Display instead not recognizing real monitor. Any guidance will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  
Feb 22 15:42:23 <Khaytsus>	_AnK: Shouldn't have to do anything, should just work.  What's the problem?  Windows only lets you pick smaller resolutions?
Feb 22 15:42:50 <_AnK>	yes, exactly.
Feb 22 15:43:25 <_AnK>	Perhaps some parameters need o be passed to qemu/kvm?
Feb 22 15:44:32 <_AnK>	But thanks - knowing that no need to install any driver on Win side - is good information.
Feb 22 15:44:32 <_AnK>	I will tweak qem/kvm instead
Feb 22 15:44:40 <_AnK>	Thanks
Feb 22 15:46:52 <Khaytsus>	I use libvirt as a viewer here on a Windows 10 vm and it resizes dynamically
Feb 22 15:47:00 <Khaytsus>	Whatever size I make the window, it just works
Feb 22 15:47:39 <_AnK>	On my older display - work the same way. .... Never had any problems. Thanks
Feb 22 15:48:07 <ledeni>	_AnK➡ do you run with vmm you need to set video model to virtio and tick 3d accer...
Feb 22 15:48:27 <_AnK>	I see let me try. Thanks
Feb 22 15:51:40 <Anvil>	Southern_Gentlem : (ssds ?). I often use those isos when I need to install, thanks.
Feb 22 15:54:05 <_AnK>	ledeni: Same result I stuck on 2560:1600 instead of 3440:1440. Thanks

Feb 22 21:11:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	geeky_gecko[m], use an imagebin please we cant manipulate so we can even read that on matrix
Feb 22 21:12:19 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Ok

Feb 22 21:16:56 <Southern_Gentlem>	thats better so as cmurf comes up from air pounce on him
Feb 22 21:17:03 <geeky_gecko[m]>	My idea was to mount the pool and restore the system with the latest snapshot.
Feb 22 21:18:42 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Thanks S_G!

Feb 22 21:31:31 <cmurf>	here
Feb 22 21:33:14 <cmurf>	what's the problem?
Feb 22 21:34:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	cmurf, HTTPS://paste.centos.org/view/6ecc351c
Feb 22 21:34:38 <cmurf>	yeah i see that not sure what's wrong though
Feb 22 21:34:59 <cmurf>	four device btrfs file system, completely normal :P
Feb 22 21:35:38 <cmurf>	you can mount any of those by /dev node
Feb 22 21:36:09 <cmurf>	just mount one of them, doesn't matter which one
Feb 22 21:36:22 <cmurf>	mount /dev/mapper/sdd1 /mnt/whatever
Feb 22 21:44:08 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Hello cmurf! We meet again. Haha.
Feb 22 21:44:54 <geeky_gecko[m]>	It complains that there is something wrong with the fs type.
Feb 22 21:48:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	geeky_gecko[m], command you used please

Feb 22 21:57:38 <pw>	oh oh i've the same problem with my crypted (ext4) external drives
Feb 22 22:00:15 <geeky_gecko[m]>	So we can conclude it has nothing to do with btrfs? Or am I jumping to conclusions?
Feb 22 22:02:51 <pw>	in my case i've try a drive with btrfs, with the same result... here i use 4 external drives hdd/sdd with encryption i can "open the container" but not mounting without this message, after that put the drive into my notebook or pc (sata connected) without this issue
Feb 22 22:11:01 <cmurf>	sorry walked away
Feb 22 22:11:25 <cmurf>	umm hmm
Feb 22 22:11:28 <cmurf>	geeky_gecko[m]:
Feb 22 22:11:45 <cmurf>	so, can you do 'sudo btrfs fi show | fpaste'
Feb 22 22:12:27 <cmurf>	and while you're at it 'fpaste --btrfsinfo'
Feb 22 22:13:23 <cmurf>	haha when it rains it pours :)
Feb 22 22:13:33 <cmurf>	pw same thing
Feb 22 22:14:03 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Ok
Feb 22 22:16:35 <geeky_gecko[m]>	HTTPS://paste.centos.org/view/eff19880
Feb 22 22:16:44 <cmurf>	pw:  'fpaste --sysinfo' and 'fpaste --btrfsinfo'
Feb 22 22:16:51 <cmurf>	i'm not sure if you have ext4 or btrfs or both
Feb 22 22:17:15 <geeky_gecko[m]>	HTTPS://paste.centos.org/view/0e00d1b7
Feb 22 22:17:48 <pw>	on my main (crypted) system i've btrfs, on my crypted external drives etx4
Feb 22 22:18:19 <pw>	in my case its not possible to mount crypted external usb-drives
Feb 22 22:20:21 <cmurf>	geeky_gecko[m]: ok so looks like you might have tried to mount the btrfs file system before all the cryptoluks devices were opened?
Feb 22 22:20:26 <braxtono[m]>	Does anyone know how to recover heif photos? I have Active & Easeus but they can't detect so I've been trying to input custom file SIG's but they aren't detecting
Feb 22 22:20:28 <cmurf>	there is till one missing, devid 5
Feb 22 22:20:37 <cmurf>	so that's why it's not mounting, devid 5 is missing
Feb 22 22:21:46 <cmurf>	devid 5 will be the most recent device you added with 'btrfs device add'
Feb 22 22:22:03 <cmurf>	s/till/still/
Feb 22 22:22:42 <geeky_gecko[m]>	I do not think so but let me try to reboot and see if I can first unlock them all and then mount btrfs.
Feb 22 22:22:50 <cmurf>	pw: someone else here might have a better idea how to handle encrypted external drives
Feb 22 22:23:20 <cmurf>	if it's plugged in during boot and has the same password as system root, plymouth will automatically try to open the external during startup
Feb 22 22:24:11 <cmurf>	but if cryptsetup open hasn't happened yet, and this external device is listed in /etc/fstab for mounting, then the mount will hang probably indefinitely and stop the startup
Feb 22 22:24:25 <pw>	i know about this, all my other device are working well
Feb 22 22:25:01 <cmurf>	ok and cryptsetup open works manually? and it mounts ok manually? I'm not following the problem
Feb 22 22:25:17 <cmurf>	geeky_gecko[m]: yeah this file system is definitely expecting 5 devices
Feb 22 22:25:20 <cmurf>	so you've got a missing device
Feb 22 22:26:40 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Shoot you are right I added the fifth one the last time.
Feb 22 22:27:13 <geeky_gecko[m]>	Let me check
Feb 22 22:31:40 <cmurf>	most btrfs error messages appear in dmesg, btw
Feb 22 22:31:44 <cmurf>	     [ 9008.616317] kernel: BTRFS error (device dm-2): devid 5 uuid 7e1ebe6d-51aa-4d96-b434-8751f7bd1b0f is missing
Feb 22 22:34:55 *	ccallahan|Backup is now known as ccallahna
Feb 22 22:35:10 *	ccallahna is now known as ccallahan
Feb 22 22:37:27 <cmurf>	you can also see the devices for all visible filesystems with 'sudo btrfs filesystem show'
Feb 22 22:37:47 <cmurf>	and if any are missing it'll indicate it
Feb 22 22:44:08 <geeky_gecko[m]>	I removed the fifth one and gave it a new destination that’s where things went wrong.
Feb 22 22:46:05 <geeky_gecko[m]>	So now btrfs has the luks id still registered but the drive is formatted as a standalone drive with luks.
Feb 22 22:47:16 <geeky_gecko[m]>	HTTPS://paste.centos.org/view/bf510988
Feb 22 22:53:40 <pw>	cmurf: yes i can open the device but not mount the filesystem

Feb 23 10:46:40 <hnsz2002>	hi all! i want to create a local, internal repo mirror, but i want to keep older packages
Feb 23 10:47:00 <hnsz2002>	which are removed from the source...
Feb 23 10:47:30 <hnsz2002>	so therefore, rsync is running without --delete option, and with exlude repodata/*
Feb 23 10:48:18 <hnsz2002>	after rsync, i try to use createrepo to generate repodata.... but this doesnt works, modules are sucks
Feb 23 10:49:09 <hnsz2002>	i already also find modulemd-tools, which is a newly rewritten alternative for createrepo and can handle modules.... but i also not succeeded with that
Feb 23 10:49:58 <hnsz2002>	can somebody give me some guidance, how can i generate the correct repodata with module infos from a locally synced rpm repository?

Feb 23 13:40:28 <death_>	hello
Feb 23 13:42:17 <death_>	hey can anyone explain the diff between dnf, yum and rpm?
Feb 23 13:45:51 <g38>	rpm deals with packages in the local database, and in files.   dnf and yum deal with packages in the local database, and in distant repositories.  yum is the old system, dnf the newer one.
Feb 23 13:47:09 <g38>	so in practice you normally most likely never use yum and very rarely use rpm (if ever)

Feb 23 16:21:38 <coz_>	%)
Feb 23 16:22:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	its a tuesday, where the issues didnt happen until after i left yesterday
Feb 23 16:23:08 <coz_>	oh!! I think I undrstand
Feb 23 16:29:05 <Khaytsus>	faern: the Fedora Server is basically the network installer.  You can instll whatever you want from it.
Feb 23 16:30:27 <Khaytsus>	It's not exactly small anymore..  600M.  We used to have BFO but I don't think it's maintained anymore.  It was a tiny network PXE kind of thing that got the latest data and did a network install.. Same image worked for every release.  But pretty sure it's dead now.
Feb 23 16:30:31 <Machiavelli[m]>	^^ this. The server iso does not have to be used to install Fedora Server. It can be used for desktop installations.
Feb 23 16:30:36 <faern>	Southern_Gentlem: I don't get the argument about gnome? A workstation centric netinstaller iso could surely let the user select any DE during setup
Feb 23 16:31:15 <Southern_Gentlem>	nope only the server one allows selection of other des
Feb 23 16:31:31 <coz_>	everything iso?
Feb 23 16:31:34 <Khaytsus>	Server == Network installer
Feb 23 16:31:38 <Khaytsus>	coz_: no....
Feb 23 16:32:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	coz_, the way i am reading this is that faern doesnt think that the lives are useful
Feb 23 16:32:41 <coz_>	Southern_Gentlem, oh!! mm odd
Feb 23 16:33:40 <coz_>	faern, could yousay agin your first post, I was not here at the time
Feb 23 16:34:06 <Khaytsus>	I think they have been answered.
Feb 23 16:34:11 <Khaytsus>	If htey want a network installer, use server.
Feb 23 16:34:12 <coz_>	ok
Feb 23 16:35:28 <MICROburst>	How is fetchmail intended to be run? There is a /etc/fetchmailrc.example but there is no systemctl .service file. The mail server is using virtual users so putting it  as .fetchmailrc in a user's home would not work.
Feb 23 16:36:01 <faern>	Southern_Gentlem: I'm not complaining about anything with the current ISOs.
Feb 23 16:36:20 <faern>	I just asked *if* there was any netinstall iso for workstations.
Feb 23 16:36:31 <faern>	But I guess the server netinstall iso could be used for that.
Feb 23 16:37:00 <faern>	coz_: 16:13 <faern> Is there no netinstall iso for workstation like there is for server? I think that's a preferred installation method. Small iso -> Only download the latest stuff once.
Feb 23 16:37:37 <Southern_Gentlem>	faern,  the is a workstation netinstall but that is for gnome only
Feb 23 16:37:39 <coz_>	faern, ah ok. so are you satisfied with all the responses?
Feb 23 16:38:00 <faern>	Yes!
Feb 23 16:38:15 <coz_>	MICROburst, not sure, did you read here?   https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/System_Administrators_Guide/s2-email-mta-fetchmail.html
Feb 23 16:38:17 <MICROburst>	faern: Boot off the network using ipxe or grub. Point them to a fedora mirror with vmlinuz and initrd
Feb 23 16:39:13 <MICROburst>	coz_: Yep, seen that already. The ".fetchmailrc" is what's been put in a user's home.
Feb 23 16:39:23 <Khaytsus>	faern: It's not "can be used" it's the purpose of the server iso.. why they felt calling it 'server" vs just the previous name of "network install" I don't know.
Feb 23 16:40:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	well at one time there was a workstation netinstall but i am not seeing it now
Feb 23 16:40:15 <faern>	Yeah. The name does not imply that's the purpose :D
Feb 23 16:40:43 <Khaytsus>	The current server iso _is_ what the network install used to be.
Feb 23 16:40:58 <coz_>	strange rename
Feb 23 16:41:17 <Khaytsus>	I guess someone wanted to market Fedora as not just being a desktop OS?  I dunno.
Feb 23 16:41:53 <faern>	The website can still have a big button for server. But it goes to a page allowing you to download the netinstall and a text saying the iso can be used to install the "server version"
Feb 23 16:43:23 <faern>	But I see now that under the workstation download page there is the "But wait! There's more"-section that links to alternative downloads which in turn allows me to download the "server"/netinstall iso :D
Feb 23 16:43:45 <coz_>	cool
Feb 23 16:43:56 <faern>	Very undiscoverable :D
Feb 23 16:43:57 <Khaytsus>	faern: Yeah, because 95% of users want Workstation, 5% want other spins, and .0000000000000001% want server ;)
Feb 23 16:43:58 <ledeni>	faern:yes but server-netinstall allow to select software what you want to install
Feb 23 16:44:05 <faern>	But I got all the answers I needed. Will use the server ISO from now on :)
Feb 23 16:44:21 <squarebracket>	is there a way to configure systemd-resolved to not use split dns? i want to have the old functionality where if my router returns NXDOMAIN it checks my vpn dns servers.
Feb 23 16:44:42 <faern>	Khaytsus: Really? Seems greatly exaggerated, no? I use it both for workstations and servers, but I surely have many more servers than workstations.
Feb 23 16:44:45 <squarebracket>	we've got a bunch of old domains from name changes over the years and i don't really want to manually configure each one for my vpn connection
Feb 23 16:45:10 <faern>	ledeni: Yes. I got that now. But it's very unclear from how the website markets the iso
Feb 23 16:45:42 <Khaytsus>	squarebracket: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/systemd-resolved    pretty sure the opting out here is what you want to do?  Not sure, working on something else so can't compare your scenrio
Feb 23 16:47:44 <squarebracket>	Khaytsus: yeah, i don't really want to fully opt out of systemd-resolved since then i'm drifting from the official configuration, but it probably is my best option :(

Feb 23 17:14:26 <paint-it-black>	Khaytsus  ah just got back from lunch .. a lot has transpired ... I think I know why it went ape over the updates.  Is this possible ... I installed the font tweak tool,  it asked for a list of language preferences, so I listed a few.  I guess then it went and updated all software affected by the additional languages?
Feb 23 17:15:07 <Khaytsus>	paint-it-black: No idea.  Perhaps.  You'd have to actually be more specific about what it did and look at the logs I guess.
Feb 23 17:23:56 <paint-it-black>	Sure, as you know from yesterday the root partition on the boot device was foo bar.  I was able to decrypt and map the home partition so no data was lost. (most was backed up anyway).   I never did get that media to boot.  So I installed fedora 33 from the live iso from getfedora.   (The other media was f33 from an upgrade).    After
Feb 23 17:23:56 <paint-it-black>	installing f33 fresh I did an update.   Then started installing various software (using dnf in a shell!  LOL no stinkin GUI program LOL) I did run "gnome software"  to turn off the auto updates.   In the course of trying to get things back to hunkey dorey,  I installed the font tweak tool (as a opposed to the gnome tweak tool) ... really
Feb 23 17:23:57 <paint-it-black>	getting into gnome gui tools now LO.   The gnome font tweak tool has an option for giving a list of languages, so I did.   After leaving the tool I ran updates again in prep for another install, and it went CRAZY   1565 packages to update!   But I already did an update after an install, if anything should have been a huge update, it should have
Feb 23 17:23:57 <paint-it-black>	been that one.  .... so I am thinking the language list on the gnome font tweak tool caused this,  is that possible?   Or was there just a mammoth f33 update ?
Feb 23 17:26:49 <paint-it-black>	it is a curious thing is all,  the udpate is done .. but why the first was not huge but the second .. go figure
Feb 23 17:29:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	paint-it-black, no idea but is everyone seems to be running ok now
Feb 23 17:29:24 <Southern_Gentlem>	opps everyone/everything
Feb 23 17:32:49 <paint-it-black>	So here is an install problem.  In emacs and in the terminal the Deja Vu Sans Mono font, the underscores are gone.
Feb 23 17:32:49 <paint-it-black>	https://imgur.com/a/8f3h8dj   They are showing up as a barely visiable light gray.   I had a similar problem some years ago.  This has been reported by others as a bug in the past.  .. but that was a long time ago.   ... do you know how to get the underscores back?
Feb 23 17:33:16 <Southern_Gentlem>	nope i am not an emacs users
Feb 23 17:33:27 <paint-it-black>	gnome-terminal also
Feb 23 17:33:35 <Southern_Gentlem>	try another font
Feb 23 17:33:38 <paint-it-black>	it is a font issue, not an application issue
Feb 23 17:34:09 <paint-it-black>	there is not really another option for the default install.   Monospace aliases to the Deja Vu Sans Mono
Feb 23 17:35:51 <paint-it-black>	So I just added RPM Fusion to get get some other fonts.  Given that the gnome-terminal is pretty popular, and this is a problem with the default font on a fresh install -- and I am running on a very good display monitor here a QLED high resolution monitor, it does not get crisper than this -- seems someone would have run into this and have
Feb 23 17:35:51 <paint-it-black>	something to say about it.
Feb 23 17:40:23 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Hello! So I've got this problem. Every time I play a game that's more complicated than Nethack, Gargoyle IF interpreter, or PrBoom+, my computer eventually crashes in the middle of playing it. Completely freezes up, completely unresponsive.
Feb 23 17:40:41 <Copenhagen_Bram>	It just did that in the middle of me playing Mindustry. Is there anything I can do about it?
Feb 23 17:47:37 <paint-it-black>	seems to be a problem with gnomes anti-aliasing algorithm.  It is erasing the underscores.  I just turned it off and they came back.
Feb 23 17:48:21 <paint-it-black>	though the letters are a bit uglier also.
Feb 23 17:48:57 <paint-it-black>	enough futzing with this today.  Hope that will get fixed someday.   Have a wonderful day folks.
Feb 23 17:49:14 <Southern_Gentlem>	Copenhagen_Bram, sudo fpaste --sysinfo

Feb 23 17:52:42 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Well great, what the heck does "Warning: dracut-initqueue timeout - starting timeout scripts" mean?
Feb 23 17:53:17 <Copenhagen_Bram>	and it's in emergency mode now
Feb 23 17:54:28 <paint-it-black>	p.s. full hinting and aliasing also shows the underscores and the letters are cleaner .. suppose a person could play with this all day.
Feb 23 17:55:26 <Copenhagen_Bram>	maybe I got the luks password incorrect or something?
Feb 23 17:58:07 <Sokel>	the system cannot adequately mount the file systems to boot.
Feb 23 17:58:17 <Sokel>	If your luks password was incorrect, then the password prompt woudl come back.
Feb 23 17:59:49 <Copenhagen_Bram>	You'd think... but from the journalctl log it looked as though the problem was it couldn't find /dev/mapper/luks-whatever. And after I rebooted again, now it's booting up fine.
Feb 23 18:01:31 <Copenhagen_Bram>	It also said something about too many incorrect password attempts.
Feb 23 18:04:02 <entflammen>	o/
Feb 23 18:04:16 <Copenhagen_Bram>	hey entflammen
Feb 23 18:04:22 <entflammen>	I'm having some issues with multi-monitor
Feb 23 18:04:30 <entflammen>	howdy!
Feb 23 18:04:38 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Hmm. What kind of issues?
Feb 23 18:05:14 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I'm not very experienced with multi-monitor but I did plug my computer into a tv screen successfully about a week ago
Feb 23 18:05:44 <entflammen>	I have a laptop running Fedora 33, upgraded from 32 over winter break, and it's had an issue where I can have a secondary monitor connected as a standard dual monitor set up, but when I unplug the hdmi cable to take my laptop on the go, the laptop screen refuses to switch back to being the primary display and stays off
Feb 23 18:07:32 <entflammen>	but when I plug the laptop back into the monitor, the display comes right back on and everything works again
Feb 23 18:07:58 <entflammen>	workaround that I've found is to always switch the laptop to be the primary monitor before unplugging, but it just becomes a bit of a hassle
Feb 23 18:08:16 <Copenhagen_Bram>	hmmmm
Feb 23 18:09:01 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I guess I never had that problem with the tv screen because my laptop screen was always the primary one. Except when I closed my laptop, then the tv screen would switch to primary, but the laptop screen would switch back to primary when I opened it.
Feb 23 18:09:17 <entflammen>	theres some other weirdness with displays that makes me think that something bigger is going on, like sometimes I have to reboot in order to even connect and set up my other monitor
Feb 23 18:11:50 <Copenhagen_Bram>	ugh, I wish computers would just work properly sometimes.
Feb 23 18:13:35 <Copenhagen_Bram>	uh oh, I hope ssh doesn't clear the screen after it inevitally loses the connection when my computer crashes
Feb 23 18:14:01 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I need to be able to at least see the last part of dmesg -w and journalctl -f

Feb 23 18:35:03 <Copenhagen_Bram>	eh, i'm not good at reading journalctls
Feb 23 18:37:58 <stefan__>	hello all, is there already kernel 5.11 for f33?
Feb 23 18:40:32 <oDn_>	Hey everyone, what would be the most straightforward and foolproof method to use certbot to automatically renew the letsencrypt certificate used for the cockpit web interface ?
Feb 23 18:41:20 <oDn_>	So far, I've had to manually create then copy the key and cert file to /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/ directory and fix the permissions.
Feb 23 18:41:35 <oDn_>	It's far from being elegant!
Feb 23 18:42:14 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Well, my computer crashed again, while I was playing Mindustry, again. But this time I got the last part of the journalctl and dmesg.
Feb 23 18:42:40 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Also ssh failed because of a broken pipe, so my computer really is crashed, it's not just the video
Feb 23 18:43:23 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Is there an alternative button to push than sysrq for ctrl+alt+sysrq+reisub? My Fedora laptop doesn't seem to have a sysrq button
Feb 23 18:43:43 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Not even the prt sc, the prt sc only doubles as insert

Feb 23 18:56:40 <cmurf>	Copenhagen_Bram: reboot -f should work
Feb 23 18:57:27 <cmurf>	but for sysrq you can do, as root, echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger
Feb 23 18:57:39 <cmurf>	you might want to sync first
Feb 23 19:05:51 <Copenhagen_Bram>	cmurf: I can't run those commands if my computer is frozen.
Feb 23 19:06:16 <Copenhagen_Bram>	But, I just enabled magic sysrq, and it did something when I tried reisub by holding ctrl alt and prt sc.
Feb 23 19:06:46 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I think x exited or something, there was just a blinking cursor on my screen, so I pressed r, e, i, s, u, b
Feb 23 19:06:58 <Copenhagen_Bram>	But my computer did not reboot after I pressed b
Feb 23 19:07:19 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Also I pressed ctrl-alt-f3 and got a login terminal

Feb 23 19:51:56 <cmurf>	offhand i don't see anything that explains the problem
Feb 23 19:52:18 <cmurf>	did a reboot happen or no?
Feb 23 19:52:50 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I think a few reboots happened. I certainly didn't run fpaste while my computer was crashed.
Feb 23 19:53:25 <cmurf>	ok and is this a one off crash or is it happening often
Feb 23 19:53:50 <Copenhagen_Bram>	It seems to happen every time I play a game with OpenGL graphics. Mindustry, Minetest, Colobot, GZDoom.
Feb 23 19:53:56 <cmurf>	gotcha
Feb 23 19:54:06 <Copenhagen_Bram>	It works fine for a while, then everything freezes up
Feb 23 19:54:23 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Once, the capslock light even flashed (kernel panic)
Feb 23 19:54:35 <cmurf>	well that's not good
Feb 23 19:54:45 <Copenhagen_Bram>	no.
Feb 23 19:55:02 <Copenhagen_Bram>	At least Mindustry seems to autosave.
Feb 23 19:55:14 <cmurf>	can you check previous boots?
Feb 23 19:55:29 <Copenhagen_Bram>	How?
Feb 23 19:55:30 <cmurf>	journalctl -b is the current boot log
Feb 23 19:55:55 <cmurf>	journalctl -b-1 is the previous one, and you can add -k to see just kernel messages
Feb 23 19:55:59 <cmurf>	journal -b-2 is the one before that and so on
Feb 23 19:56:01 <cmurf>	journalctl rather
Feb 23 19:57:28 <cmurf>	in your past i see sysrq w and f
Feb 23 19:57:34 <cmurf>	s/past/paste/
Feb 23 19:57:52 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Yeah, I was just testing out sysrq commands.
Feb 23 19:58:12 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Maybe next time it crashes I can do sysrq reisub instead of holding the power button
Feb 23 19:58:14 <cmurf>	got it
Feb 23 19:59:16 <cmurf>	anyway it'd be useful to know where the journals stop
Feb 23 19:59:35 <cmurf>	i.e. journalctl -b-1 -k --no-pager, and then try -b-2, then -b-3
Feb 23 19:59:51 <cmurf>	because if they stop before logging the problem, then the journal isn't much help figuring it out
Feb 23 20:00:42 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Looks like -b-3 happened before a crash
Feb 23 20:01:11 <Copenhagen_Bram>	It kinda does stop before logging a problem, but there are a few libinput errors at the end
Feb 23 20:01:26 <Copenhagen_Bram>	But I got the same thing through ssh
Feb 23 20:01:29 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Lemme do a journalctl -b-3 | tail | fpaste
Feb 23 20:01:53 <Copenhagen_Bram>	https://paste.centos.org/view/7e096aff
Feb 23 20:01:53 <cmurf>	i suggest filtering with -k for kernel messages
Feb 23 20:02:29 <cmurf>	yeah i see messages like that too, that doesn't really explain what's taking down the kernel
Feb 23 20:02:37 <cmurf>	or at least making it super unresponsive
Feb 23 20:02:44 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Here it is with -k https://paste.centos.org/view/cddd5180
Feb 23 20:03:00 <cmurf>	normal stuff
Feb 23 20:03:20 <cmurf>	need the whole thing though, so remove tail
Feb 23 20:04:15 <Copenhagen_Bram>	Will I get more info with sudo journalctl?
Feb 23 20:05:16 <cmurf>	good question, i'm not sure
Feb 23 20:05:29 <cmurf>	i think users in wheel don't need sudo for journalctl info
Feb 23 20:07:04 <Copenhagen_Bram>	one sudo journalctl -b-3 -k | fpaste coming right up: https://paste.centos.org/view/a7afb536
Feb 23 20:08:00 <cmurf>	ok i just tried it with and without sudo output to files, and diffed the files and they are the same minus the last second where the 2nd one logs the sudo
Feb 23 20:09:25 <cmurf>	i don't see anything weird in that fpaste
Feb 23 20:10:20 <Copenhagen_Bram>	do you think it might be an oom?
Feb 23 20:10:39 <Copenhagen_Bram>	i mean, do you think it might be out of memory or something? Maybe I should try sysrq f next time it crashes
Feb 23 20:10:55 <cmurf>	bug also that seems like the wrong boot because the start is Feb 23 10:57:45 and the end is Feb 23 11:00:17
Feb 23 20:11:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	still want to see the sudo fpaste --sysinfo so we can see what hardware we are dealing with
Feb 23 20:11:10 <cmurf>	so it's just 3 minutes of kernel message, it's basically just a startup
Feb 23 20:11:20 <cmurf>	oh that's up ^
Feb 23 20:11:39 <cmurf>	https://paste.centos.org/view/018ebbd0
Feb 23 20:11:40 <cmurf>	that's it
Feb 23 20:12:01 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I know it's the right boot because without -k I can see I was playing mindustry
Feb 23 20:12:38 <Copenhagen_Bram>	also, there's no error messages, business as usual, but there's also no messages about going through the normal process of shutting down or rebooting

Feb 26 02:32:31 <plarsen>	solicito, what IO driver are you using with libvirt for that VM?
Feb 26 02:34:11 <solicito>	plarsen: how do I know
Feb 26 02:35:01 <plarsen>	You created it? When you create a VM, you specify (or get the option to change the default) which driver is used.  So why don't you start from the top - what did you do? What program did you use?
Feb 26 02:36:41 <solicito>	so when create the vm, I get to steps 4 out of 5
Feb 26 02:37:16 <plarsen>	Don't know what that is ... is that something from the Windows installer?
Feb 26 02:37:58 <solicito>	the options i have are: enable storage for this virtual machine, create a disk image for this virtual machine, and select or create custom storage
Feb 26 02:38:07 <solicito>	no, this is when creating the vm
Feb 26 02:38:15 <plarsen>	What program are you using?
Feb 26 02:38:28 <solicito>	qemu/kvm
Feb 26 02:38:54 <solicito>	i was able to create oneo last week, but I had to delete it and now, I can't do it anymore
Feb 26 02:38:59 <solicito>	do not know what happened
Feb 26 02:39:40 <plarsen>	No you're not. If you were, you would know what driver you use as it's only supported using command line.  What software are you using that provides you a GUI talking about steps?
Feb 26 02:40:04 <solicito>	virtual machine manager
Feb 26 02:40:13 <plarsen>	Ahhh - good.
Feb 26 02:40:21 <plarsen>	So in the virtual console - click settings
Feb 26 02:40:32 <plarsen>	And find your disk. What driver does it say that it's using?
Feb 26 02:41:10 <solicito>	well, let me create it again
Feb 26 02:41:30 <plarsen>	If you do that, click "customize before install"
Feb 26 02:41:49 <plarsen>	That brings up the configuration options where you can see/change the drivers for Disk IO, network etc.
Feb 26 02:43:42 <solicito>	disk bus: sata
Feb 26 02:44:46 <solicito>	i don't see anything about a drive in the disk section
Feb 26 02:45:15 <plarsen>	You should see a disk. If you do not, that's your answer :D
Feb 26 02:45:29 <plarsen>	If you see a disk, and you see VirtIO you must install the Windows drivers for that;
Feb 26 02:45:45 <solicito>	i see disk 1
Feb 26 02:45:56 <solicito>	disk bus: sata
Feb 26 02:46:37 <solicito>	under disk bus, if i click the drop down menu, i see virtIO
Feb 26 02:46:56 <solicito>	should I choose that virtIO?
Feb 26 02:47:04 <plarsen>	Try to set that to SCSI and start your windows installer boot.  If you still have issues, you should do the expert install option where you can run fdisk or something similar from Windows, where it will tell you what it sees etc.
Feb 26 02:47:19 <plarsen>	No - VirtIO will only work on Windows if you use special Windows drivers.
Feb 26 02:47:52 <solicito>	ok so i set it scsi
Feb 26 02:48:05 <solicito>	will click apply and star begin the installation
Feb 26 02:48:26 <solicito>	or just begin installation
Feb 26 02:48:50 <solicito>	unable to complete install
Feb 26 02:48:58 <solicito>	unsuppprted configuration
Feb 26 02:49:20 <solicito>	directory storage forma is not directly supporte by qemu use dir disk type instead
Feb 26 02:51:21 <plarsen>	How is your disk domain configured?
Feb 26 02:51:29 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210212 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Feb 26 02:51:50 <solicito>	how do I know that?
Feb 26 02:53:34 <plarsen>	In Virtual Manager - pick edit in the menu and the "Connection Details"
Feb 26 02:53:48 <plarsen>	This opens a window with connection to Qemu and a few other tabs, one is called Storage.
Feb 26 02:54:13 <plarsen>	You'll have at leats one storage setup there called Default ... but you may have more than one.
Feb 26 02:55:44 <linuxmodder>	never cared for the layout of that tbh
Feb 26 02:56:12 <solicito>	to the left, i have several
Feb 26 02:56:18 <solicito>	pool
Feb 26 02:56:24 <solicito>	filesystem directory
Feb 26 02:56:38 <solicito>	my name filesystem directory
Feb 26 02:57:01 <solicito>	and then, windows 10 iso
Feb 26 02:57:22 <solicito>	I think last time, I deleted something from here
Feb 26 02:57:49 <solicito>	the problem now is, how do I get it back or fix it
Feb 26 02:59:32 <plarsen>	Your error indicates that for SOME reason Windows cares how the hypervisor stores the virtual disk.
Feb 26 03:00:02 <plarsen>	I'm not a Windows guy - haven't run it for more than a decade, so I'm not sure if there are tricks to make Windows run as a VM - it should not care. That said, using a Directory is quite common
Feb 26 03:00:28 <plarsen>	So be sure the directory exists and is accessible to qemu. When you create the VM, use "custom" disk, and pick the right disk domain.
Feb 26 03:00:44 <plarsen>	You then "manually" create the disk, and virtual manager will assign it to the VM
Feb 26 03:00:54 <plarsen>	(manually create it by hitting the big +)
Feb 26 03:01:52 <plarsen>	If your Windows somehow thinks it need full access to a raw device, my guess is that Windows wants to own your hardware perhaps because it's not meant to be used on virtual machines. In that case my advice is simple "don't".
Feb 26 03:02:49 <Sokel>	It shouldn't be trying to use it as a raw device. I've never had that happen choosing windows for a VM.
Feb 26 03:03:02 <linuxmodder>	solicito,  coming in late what is the error ?
Feb 26 03:03:15 <plarsen>	The default storage type is "Filesystem Directory". Never had an issue with it - EVER. I "dir disk" doesn't exist, but you can definitely provide raw disk access to a VM
Feb 26 03:03:15 <linuxmodder>	and confirming windows is the guest vm on fedora host yes?
Feb 26 03:03:27 <solicito>	yes
Feb 26 03:03:42 <Sokel>	So you're making a new VM, you attach a disk, and the windows installer doesn't see the disk?
Feb 26 03:03:55 <solicito>	when installing the vm, windows is not able to find a disk to install the os
Feb 26 03:04:09 <Sokel>	Then you need the virtio scsi driver.
Feb 26 03:04:24 <solicito>	i was able to installed it last week
Feb 26 03:04:37 <solicito>	but I had to delete it and now I cannot do it anymore

Feb 26 10:36:33 <d9k>	that repodata.xml in the repo does not match the files
Feb 26 10:41:26 <d9k>	mirror.crucial.com.au and fedora.mirror.digitalpacific.com.au are out of sync
Feb 26 10:43:21 <d9k>	or broken in general since that shouldnt happen
Feb 26 10:43:50 <d9k>	if you do --refresh and get lucky it works hehe
Feb 26 10:45:45 <cwegener>	Ha. Yeah, I can work around it for now with --refresh. Thanks.
Feb 26 10:50:25 <d9k>	the mirrormanager maybe should check that the mirror is actually half working before returning it
Feb 26 10:51:14 <cwegener>	:(
Feb 26 10:52:12 <cwegener>	Maybe some regional connectivity issues ... That's not unusual in AU/NZ
Feb 26 10:54:32 <d9k>	the only NZ mirror looks like working, you can edit the metalink for the .repo files in /etc/yum.repos.d to workaround
Feb 26 10:54:57 <d9k>	append &country=nz to the end
Feb 26 10:58:46 <d9k>	just remember you did it when all mirrors are down lol
Feb 26 11:01:52 <cwegener>	until dnf update -q -y --refresh; do echo "Trying again"; done
Feb 26 11:01:59 <cwegener>	This seems safer for now :)

Feb 26 17:56:04 <peac>	hey, i've installed plymouth and it's not showing up at boot, i added "rhgb quiet" to /etc/default/grub and regenerated config but still nothing, what could be wrong ?
Feb 26 17:59:18 <Southern_Gentlem>	peac, ok explain why you had to install plymouth
Feb 26 17:59:51 <peac>	i'm using fedora-iot which must be compareable to coreos
Feb 26 18:00:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	then #fedora-iot for you
Feb 26 18:00:26 <peac>	the discussion there is more about os internals but thanks
Feb 26 18:03:13 <Khaytsus>	Why is there even coreos and IoT.  They seem.....  basically the same
Feb 26 18:03:56 <peac>	iot is for arm devices and has all the vendor things for raspberry, coreos is more for x86
Feb 26 18:04:34 <Khaytsus>	So make multiple archs of the same thing.heh
Feb 26 18:04:48 <[R]>	khaytsus: well you can't just have the golden arches... gotta have multiple arches
Feb 26 18:05:08 *	Khaytsus gives [R] a golden...  oh wait
Feb 26 18:08:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	so [R] is makeing a McDs run Whooohooo
Feb 26 18:10:23 <[R]>	Southern_Gentlem: for myself... sharing is definitly not caring
Feb 26 18:12:21 <dowdle>	peac: The S in IoT is for security.
Feb 26 18:13:10 <peac>	dowdle: do you mean the distro is not secure ? what do you see as not secure in this architecture ?
Feb 26 18:20:30 <peac>	I don't really understand the anger here against fedora iot... if one size fits all, why have fedora-arm ? fedora-iot is just the same based on ostree, convenient for remote system config updates and factory resets, and the great tooling of coreos. I'm just a user by the way.
Feb 26 18:20:40 <dowdle>	peac: Just IoT in general. :)
Feb 26 18:20:58 <peac>	also it's based on fedora 33, so this channels seemed to apply for end user support about it
Feb 26 18:21:48 <dowdle>	peac: See this fine hour long presentation from USENIX on AI & IoT topics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k
Feb 26 18:22:59 <dowdle>	 (it is histerical)
Feb 26 18:23:29 <peac>	dowdle: a raspberry connected to internet and properly configured is just a computer, if it's not publicly exposed i don't see the issue with it
Feb 26 18:24:12 *	dowdle shares dowdle's sense-of-humor with peac
Feb 26 18:24:39 <dowdle>	peac: No one has anger for IoT here.
Feb 26 18:26:09 <peac>	i'll check the keynote, looks fun
Feb 26 18:53:48 <Southern_Gentlem>	peac,  no anger just not something we handle enough in this channel to help people

Mar 01 20:43:17 *	Southern_Gentlem points coz_  to #fedora-qa for F34 and rawhide discussions 
Mar 01 20:43:27 <Copenhagen_Bram>	i couldn't believe it, ubuntu is the biggest, most popular linux distro ever, and i had the latest version of ubuntu on a usb drive, not even the LTE edition, and it didn't automatically rotate the screen or bring up the on screen keyboard on my tablet laptop
Mar 01 20:44:02 <Copenhagen_Bram>	btw i'd love to install fedora on that tablet laptop but the EFI on it hates grub for some reason
Mar 01 20:44:28 <Copenhagen_Bram>	but someone had a way to fail installing Ubuntu and then fix the bootloader afterwards
Mar 01 20:44:36 <Copenhagen_Bram>	i ended up installing Pop! OS on it though
Mar 01 20:45:06 <Copenhagen_Bram>	oh wait this among sus thing is multiplayer?
Mar 01 20:45:31 <Copenhagen_Bram>	I just entered my name as player 1, am I waiting for other people to connect somehow?
Mar 01 20:45:36 <Copenhagen_Bram>	whoops wrong chat
Mar 01 20:51:31 <cmurf>	Copenhagen_Bram: maybe start doing memory tests when you sleep? just leave the laptop doing a memtest overnight every night
Mar 01 20:51:32 <gr8>	Hi, is it still possible to open multiple X servers / desktops on different VTs, using Ctrl-Alt-F2 etc.? I want to have separate home directories for different users, but switch between them while they are logged in
Mar 01 20:53:11 <cmurf>	Copenhagen_Bram: if this is a UEFI system, you probably want to get the free one (right side link) of this
Mar 01 20:53:16 <cmurf>	https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm
Mar 01 20:53:30 <cmurf>	it's a proprietary license so not in fedora, but there is a no cost version that runs on uefi
Mar 01 20:53:55 <cmurf>	if your laptop is BIOS you can use the memtest86+ that comes preinstalled in fedora
Mar 01 20:55:28 <cmurf>	there is also memtester in the repo but i don't have much experience with it
Mar 01 20:56:44 <Shipp>	I know coreos is usually used in containers, but does anyone here use it as a host system and recommend it?
Mar 01 21:07:24 <cmurf>	Shipp: it is intended to work both baremetal and vm with the same image, as far as i know

Mar 18 10:28:58 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Btw anyone here know how to merge two text file content while not repeat the same parts？
Mar 18 10:29:42 <nvfanonlah[m]>	I think xx>>just appends it. The problem is how to detect the same line.
Mar 18 10:30:21 <nvfanonlah[m]>	I guess need perl or lua or python. If someone have a sh script will be extremely appreciated.
Mar 18 10:33:08 <Sokel>	Depending on what you're trying to do, sort -u file1 file2 or sort file1 file2 | uniq if they're in order. you could probably also do awk '![$0]++ {print}' file1 file2. depending on what your use case is or what you're actually trying to do, perl or python is your best bet.
Mar 18 10:34:36 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Thanks will try your suggestions.
Mar 18 10:41:26 <n0ps1ed>	nvfanonlah[m], use meld
Mar 18 10:41:48 <n0ps1ed>	https://meldmerge.org/
Mar 18 10:44:02 <n0ps1ed>	if the file is super out of order and not just missing pieces with diffs that wont help, but you could combine that with some sort/uniq output like Sokel suggested

Mar 18 10:50:12 <kiwikiwik>	hello, how can i install R without all texlive dependencies?
Mar 18 10:57:21 <n0ps1ed>	compile it yourself and remove them
Mar 18 10:57:43 <n0ps1ed>	the real question is why
Mar 18 10:58:02 <n0ps1ed>	do you not want some nice pdf exports of your data?
Mar 18 10:58:19 <kiwikiwik>	i'd like to use tinytex instead
Mar 18 11:00:29 <n0ps1ed>	if there is a distro that has it packaged that way i would suggest using podman to run a conatiner and do it there
Mar 18 11:01:55 <n0ps1ed>	can you use R with tinytex with the texlive deps installed? why must you not install them?
Mar 18 11:02:28 <kiwikiwik>	yes i think so...
Mar 18 11:02:35 <nvfanonlah[m]>	<n0ps1ed "https://meldmerge.org/"> Thanks
Mar 18 11:03:14 <kiwikiwik>	i have an ugly biblatex bug with bookdown and maybe it works with tinytex https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/blob/39d2c10fcc2b024d77c52ae7f057487f2f302dfb/R/latex.R#L65
Mar 18 11:04:44 <n0ps1ed>	so maybe what you should be doing is just installing R, and tinytex and not worrying about the texlive deps (unless they conflict) and explore the options from R to use tinytex. i have not used R, but that would be the path i would try
Mar 18 11:05:14 <kiwikiwik>	Ok let's hope for the best.`I recommend that you uninstall your existing LaTeX distribution.`
Mar 18 11:05:14 <kiwikiwik>	~ Yihui Xie in TinyTeX
Mar 18 11:06:27 <n0ps1ed>	https://hub.docker.com/r/csdaw/rmarkdown-tinytex
Mar 18 11:07:37 <kiwikiwik>	thanks but using a docker image is not feasible
Mar 18 11:07:40 <n0ps1ed>	download the dockerfile, look it over, build with podman, and put your doc on there, test it out. or just yolo, pull the image without checking it, and have a go
Mar 18 11:08:01 <n0ps1ed>	why is that not feasable
Mar 18 11:08:44 <kiwikiwik>	my bookdown stuff has some more deps. it's too much work
Mar 18 11:10:44 <nvfanonlah[m]>	Gg Dependencies hell
Mar 18 11:10:47 <n0ps1ed>	so your at a crossroads here, your ether going to have to do work to your local setup to get tinytex working, or do work to a container to get your software setup. downloading and customizing the docker file is pretty damn wazy
Mar 18 11:11:30 <nvfanonlah[m]>	One of the way is to save your current state. Do a small fork comment out and resolve the hell.
Mar 18 11:12:19 <FranciscoD>	looks like the Requires are included in the spec: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/R/blob/rawhide/f/R.spec#_315
Mar 18 11:12:44 <FranciscoD>	kiwikiwik: so, theoretically, you could comment out the lines there that "Require: .." latex bits and rebuild the rpm
Mar 18 11:14:02 <kiwikiwik>	FranciscoD thank you. then I have to exclude R from further updates or?
Mar 18 11:14:07 <FranciscoD>	kiwikiwik: it may get messy though: it relies on a TeX implementation for building from the looks of it
Mar 18 11:14:16 <kiwikiwik>	ok
Mar 18 11:14:20 <FranciscoD>	kiwikiwik: yes, you'll have to pin your rpm version etc.
Mar 18 11:14:31 <FranciscoD>	no easy way to do this with the R package in the repos, I'm afraid
Mar 18 11:15:07 <FranciscoD>	kiwikiwik: does upstream not provided a binary installation?
Mar 18 11:15:11 <FranciscoD>	that'll probably be the simplest way to go
Mar 18 11:15:32 <FranciscoD>	the packages in the repos are built to work well with other packages in the repos---so trying to make them work with other stuff will not be trivial

Mar 18 12:48:08 <dmlloyd>	if I want to customize my fail2ban configuration (sshd failure bantime) where should I specify that?  jail.conf says "YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THIS FILE"
Mar 18 12:48:37 <dmlloyd>	can I just create a jail.local file in /etc I guess?
Mar 18 12:49:30 <dmlloyd>	I guess I'll try that
Mar 18 12:50:26 <dmlloyd>	I just seem to have a lot of repeat offenders
Mar 18 12:50:29 <Devices>	you are correct: https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/MANUAL_0_8#Configuration
Mar 18 12:50:56 <Devices>	you can create an override fail2ban.local in /etc/fail2ban/
Mar 18 12:51:20 <dmlloyd>	it seems to work
Mar 18 12:51:27 <Devices>	otherwise for a specific jail you can create a file in filter.d/sshd.conf
Mar 18 12:51:58 <Devices>	that should probably be sshd.local actually
Mar 18 12:53:53 <Khaytsus>	Yes, that's one issue I have with fail2ban..  there's no single-config over-ride, you literally have to copy the entire file and modify it.

Mar 18 15:50:24 <cws>	wheee
Mar 18 15:51:11 <cws>	Having an issue with an RPi4. I boot up the aarch64 Workstation 33 image, everything's ducky. I do a dnf update, and it goes to staticky mess when it restarts. Tried hand-jamming display settings (hooked up to 1080p, nothing special), no change.
Mar 18 15:52:26 <coz_>	Maxwell's laws
Mar 18 15:52:52 <coz_>	sorry wrong channel
Mar 18 15:54:12 <Devices>	what is being updated then cws?
Mar 18 15:54:37 <cws>	700 something odd packages.
Mar 18 15:56:39 <Devices>	that's difficult to narrow down then
Mar 18 15:59:56 <Devices>	is it possible to inspect any logs?
Mar 18 16:00:00 <dowdle>	cws: How much ram?
Mar 18 16:00:32 <cws>	8GB.
Mar 18 16:00:38 <cws>	Also happens on the 4GB model.
Mar 18 16:00:48 <cws>	Tried with three different microSD cards, two of them new.
Mar 18 16:01:11 <cws>	I'll set it up again and make sure I can ssh in.
Mar 18 16:02:45 <Khaytsus>	I didn't even know hte pi4 video worked at all, I guess that got fixed
Mar 18 16:03:26 <Devices>	from wgat I can find, fedora does not even support the pi 4
Mar 18 16:03:51 <cws>	Booted up great before running updates. And arm-image-builder has rpi4 as a supported platform.
Mar 18 16:03:55 *	tnorth_ is now known as tno
Mar 18 16:04:19 <Devices>	I guess they fixed it without updating the wiki then
Mar 18 16:04:27 <Khaytsus>	cws: Might ask in #fedora-arm but pretty sure Pi 4 only works for text based, last I understood
Mar 18 16:04:46 <cws>	Okay, I'll muck with it and see what I can get.
Mar 18 16:04:50 <cws>	Heh, X forwarding from an RPi.
Mar 18 16:05:07 *	cranberry_failsa is now known as cranberry
Mar 18 16:05:15 <dowdle>	cws: So if you update... and a kernel is one of the updates... after it has updated, that is when the problem happens?  Perhap exclude the kernel from the update and see if that helps.
Mar 18 16:05:32 <Khaytsus>	Or try booting the old kernel, I assume thats a thing on a pi....
Mar 18 16:05:37 <cws>	can do.
Mar 18 16:06:01 <dowdle>	cws: Perhaps a different desktop spin if they are available because WORKSTATION (aka GNOME) wants accelerated 3D video... or it'll do software rendering... and who needs that on a Pi?
Mar 18 16:09:08 <cws>	Will try that, too, thanks
Mar 18 16:37:18 <razze[m]>	are there any known vpn regressions? Somewhere between the fedora 33 released and fedora 33 with patches, my company vpn stopped working. Using openvpn.
Mar 18 16:37:18 <biscuitsboars[m]>	I am having issue on zoom sharing audio its asking for pulseaudio . I know pipewire is used by default now but is there any way for zoom to recognize it or make it work on Fedora 34 .

Mar 22 11:46:54 <deletedaccount[7>	hello is there a satelitte channel?
Mar 22 12:42:07 <monkeybizness[m]>	Hi, quick update on the message I left yesterday about instabilities with recent kernels. Updating the bios did improve a bit my issues but didn't solve it. It appears there were errors on the pcie bus related to c-states . (old mobo msi b350m with old ryzen 5 1600). I could solve the issues by disabling pci power management in the bios.
Mar 22 12:42:27 <monkeybizness[m]>	This means no more state changes to handle and no more cpu crash....

Mar 22 12:54:23 <Pedrospdc>	Hey guys, I would like to ask for a little bit of help. Since this morning I'm unable to use dnf at all anymore as the fedora-updates.repo repository seems to be broken to me.
Mar 22 12:54:23 <Pedrospdc>	I've tried to remove all dnf cache (sudo dnf clean all, sudo rm -rf /var/cache/dnf), removing all repos in /etc/yum.repos.d and adding them 1-by-1 and fedora-updates fails whenever I add it
Mar 22 12:55:16 <Pedrospdc>	I get a bunch of 404s no matter what
Mar 22 12:55:19 <Pedrospdc>	No proxies/VPNs...
Mar 22 12:55:25 <Pedrospdc>	https://imgur.com/a/tEVNlvu Screenshot of error
Mar 22 12:55:36 <Pedrospdc>	This is a close to fresh install, done yesterday
Mar 22 12:57:04 <monkeybizness[m]>	update repos seems to be broken since this morning.  it was reported and is looked at
Mar 22 12:57:15 <FranciscoD>	monkeybizness[m]: would you have a ticket or a reference for this please?
Mar 22 12:57:46 <monkeybizness[m]>	no i just saw that in this channel earlier
Mar 22 12:59:15 <FranciscoD>	perhaps this one: https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/9749
Mar 22 12:59:17 <FranciscoD>	Pedrospdc: ^
Mar 22 12:59:34 <FranciscoD>	the errors should be gone now, it says
Mar 22 12:59:42 <FranciscoD>	try `dnf clean all` and then retry?
Mar 22 13:00:49 <Pedrospdc>	I did
Mar 22 13:01:08 *	ksurma is now known as ksurma-afk
Mar 22 13:01:21 <Pedrospdc>	Error still occurs
Mar 22 13:04:19 <FranciscoD>	Hrm, perhaps wait a bit then: maybe there's some caching somewhere
Mar 22 13:05:12 <Pedrospdc>	Great thanks Francisco
Mar 22 13:07:21 <egoppeso1984[m]>	I have a very small hole for you URL http://v.ht/36g2JG
Mar 22 13:09:18 <vancha112[m]>	hmm, small holes aside, the issue persists for me too, in case that helps anyone.
Mar 22 13:37:31 <kov>	\o is there a channel specifically for silverblue or is this it as well?
Mar 22 13:38:43 <FranciscoD>	kov: I think #silverblue exists, and this appears to be the primary discussion forum: https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/c/desktop/silverblue/6
Mar 22 13:39:15 <kov>	FranciscoD, thank you!

Mar 22 13:46:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	vancha112[m], the f33 updates is working for me ( i am in the USA) what is your qth
Mar 22 13:47:18 <vancha112[m]>	I'm not sure what qth means, but I'm in europe :o
Mar 22 13:50:04 <Southern_Gentlem>	so that tells me that its a mirror issue at this point

Mar 22 14:03:46 <OnlyHuman>	hi, created an iso but get error cannot open shared library libgnuintl.so.8 any ideas? thanks
Mar 22 14:04:58 <Southern_Gentlem>	OnlyHuman, what fedora releas e
Mar 22 14:05:40 <OnlyHuman>	Southern_Gentlem,  f33
Mar 22 14:05:57 <OnlyHuman>	looks like has kernel 5.11
Mar 22 14:05:59 <Southern_Gentlem>	nothing provides that
Mar 22 14:06:07 <Southern_Gentlem>	in f33
Mar 22 14:06:18 <OnlyHuman>	oh
Mar 22 14:06:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	i just did a dnf provides */libgnuintl.so.8 and it returns nothin
Mar 22 14:06:58 <OnlyHuman>	built enlightenment desktop which seems to want it
Mar 22 14:07:41 <Southern_Gentlem>	so are you building that from source or the packages in fedora
Mar 22 14:08:39 <OnlyHuman>	git e build
Mar 22 14:09:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	so not a fedora issue
Mar 22 14:14:48 <OnlyHuman>	https://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/fedora/33/x86_64/g/gettext-devel-0.21-3.fc33.x86_64.html
Mar 22 14:19:59 <OnlyHuman>	yes above mentions gettext-devel provides it but dnf indicates nothing provides it
Mar 22 14:26:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	well then download the rpm and put it in your own local repo and add that repo to your ks
Mar 22 14:28:59 <OnlyHuman>	Southern_Gentlem, it is already installed on the iso
Mar 22 14:33:10 <OnlyHuman>	noticed enlightenment seems missing from here https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/updates/33/Everything/SRPMS/Packages/e/
Mar 22 14:33:26 <OnlyHuman>	oh it is updates do
Mar 22 14:33:31 <OnlyHuman>	doh
Mar 22 14:38:04 <vancha112[m]>	Southern_Gentlem thanks, the issue has been fixed for me. Updating works as it should again.

Mar 22 15:17:10 <n3p>	Fedora 34 is getting rid of BLS (GRUB 2.06)?
Mar 22 15:18:45 <akik>	n3p: why's that?
Mar 22 15:19:42 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/updates/testing/34/Everything/x86_64/Packages/g/grub2-common-2.06~rc1-1.fc34.noarch.rpm
Mar 22 15:19:59 <n3p>	Fedora 34 is getting rid of BLS? (GRUB 2.06) < that was a question because I don't know. I get an unbootable system when I upgraded
Mar 22 15:21:06 <linuxmodder>	n3p:  when was last boot pre-upgrade
Mar 22 15:21:08 *	SallyAhaj_ is now known as SallyAhaj
Mar 22 15:21:43 <n3p>	Friday maybe I don't remember.
Mar 22 15:23:15 <n3p>	when a update the grub.cfg  (via grub2-mkconfig) i can see any Linux entry on reboot.
Mar 22 15:24:25 <n3p>	GRUB 2.06 is not reading /boot/loader/
Mar 22 15:25:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	n3p,  so how did you upgrade
Mar 22 15:26:03 <n3p>	I don't know if it's a bug or just a revert to BIOS config
Mar 22 15:26:17 <n3p>	Southern_Gentlem, DNF
Mar 22 15:26:43 <linuxmodder>	ssh in possible ?
Mar 22 15:26:56 <linuxmodder>	ssh -dropbear or similar or cockpit perhaps ?
Mar 22 15:27:08 <n3p>	I fixed the system is now booting with Grub 2.04
Mar 22 15:27:17 <Southern_Gentlem>	linuxmodder,  if its not booting no
Mar 22 15:27:33 <Southern_Gentlem>	n3p well this is a #fedora-qa issue at this point
Mar 22 15:28:19 <n3p>	Southern_Gentlem, OK, ty
Mar 22 15:28:39 <Southern_Gentlem>	n3p for grins sudo fpaste -sysinfo so i can see if i can replicate
Mar 22 15:45:53 <n3p>	Southern_Gentlem, did you get my msg?
Mar 22 15:46:32 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210315 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Mar 22 16:04:12 <Southern_Gentlem>	n3p, yep just saw it will do an upgrade in a vm to see if i can replicate
Mar 22 16:05:47 <Southern_Gentlem>	n3p lvm or btrfs?
Mar 22 16:08:00 <n3p>	luks+lvm+ root (ext4) + home (btrfs) (its a mess bc it's an install fc32 and then manually upgraded to btrfs
Mar 22 16:08:56 <cmurf>	n3p grub 2.06 is reading /boot/loader/entries for me
Mar 22 16:09:02 <linuxmodder>	n3p:  so you did btrfs convert in the upgrade ?
Mar 22 16:09:27 <linuxmodder>	n3p:  care to share the fpaste --sysinfo with teh entire class?
Mar 22 16:09:38 <n3p>	linuxmodder,  i converted manually after fc33 upgrade
Mar 22 16:10:32 <linuxmodder>	why not a clean conversion and only home
Mar 22 16:11:37 <n3p>	linuxmodder, because i didn't know that it was possible. I'm not a sysadmin
Mar 22 16:11:57 <cmurf>	 /home isn't related anyway
Mar 22 16:12:17 <cmurf>	need the grub.cfg in /boot/efi/EFI/fedora and the one in /boot/grub2
Mar 22 16:12:18 <linuxmodder>	n3p:  crc32c=crc32c-intel << you selected that or the coversion did?
Mar 22 16:12:23 <cmurf>	and need /etc/default/grub
Mar 22 16:13:23 <linuxmodder>	n3p: given the insane selinux errors in that fpaste drop to a rescue shell  relabel
Mar 22 16:13:40 <n3p>	linuxmodder,  I did because I changed MANUALLY in fc33 from zswap to zram and received a msg that zram was using crc32c-generic
Mar 22 16:14:07 <linuxmodder>	also seems to imply a multi-user non graphical should be possible its all gnome and x1 with teh selinux issues
Mar 22 16:15:02 <cmurf>	n3p you're confused :)
Mar 22 16:15:27 <cmurf>	btrfs uses crc32c-generic initially (switches to intel), zram uses lzo-rle not a checksumming hash
Mar 22 16:15:42 <cmurf>	anyway we need to see the files i mentioned
Mar 22 16:15:59 <linuxmodder>	so I see 2 major issues in that fpaste: 1) gnome and x11 are blocked by selinux and 2) it appears to be in a hibernation kernel_lockdown state
Mar 22 16:16:57 <n3p>	my zram is using compression-algorithm=zstd
Mar 22 16:17:35 <n3p>	i have tweaked some. it's not a fedora pristine install
Mar 22 16:19:08 <n3p>	cmurf, ok. Then I don't need that kernel setting (crc32*)
Mar 22 16:21:32 <timonatmooore>	exit
Mar 22 16:21:41 <timonatmooore>	^ oops
Mar 22 16:24:40 <n3p>	The GRUB changelog mention that they UNIFIED  EFI/BIOS configurations (but I don't like the screen flicker when parse both configs  /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg /boot/grub2/grub.cfg) That is unnecessary because I only need EFI boot so I created a symlink between them and it worked PERFECT for Fedora 32 and 33.
Mar 22 16:27:13 <cmurf>	/boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg is a stub config that forwards to the real grub.cfg at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:27:21 <cmurf>	that's what the unified feature does
Mar 22 16:27:32 <n3p>	If I remember correctly I have erased "grub2-pc" in the past because I didn't need BIOS boot. "grub2-efi" package taked care of everything
Mar 22 16:27:33 <cmurf>	the real grub.cfg for BIOS and UEFI is in the same place, /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:28:11 <cmurf>	n3p you created a symlink where pointed to what? can you post the exact ls -l line for that symlink?
Mar 22 16:30:54 <n3p>	[on dir /boot/grub2] # ln -s ../efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:31:10 <n3p>	[on dir /boot/grub2] # ln -s ../efi/EFI/fedora/gruenv
Mar 22 16:31:29 <cmurf>	ok you've got to realize that's not going to work
Mar 22 16:32:19 <n3p>	upgrade dir it well. erase my symlinks and created the unified config
Mar 22 16:32:38 <cmurf>	the unified config will work with grub2 2.04 or 2.06
Mar 22 16:33:14 <cmurf>	the unified grub feature is in grub 2.04-35
Mar 22 16:33:22 <cmurf>	the convert script is in -36
Mar 22 16:33:34 <n3p>	not in my case becase don't read /grub/loader/
Mar 22 16:33:34 <cmurf>	current is -39
Mar 22 16:34:13 <cmurf>	i don't know what /grub/loader is
Mar 22 16:34:54 <n3p>	ok, let me try to explain. my english is not goof enough
Mar 22 16:35:54 <n3p>	with this setting in /etc/default/grub "GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true"  GRUB 2.06 fails to read/boot /boot/loader/*
Mar 22 16:36:37 <cmurf>	ok that's not correct because i have GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=true and i'm using grub 2.06 with /boot/loader/entries/ drop-in snippets
Mar 22 16:36:43 <cmurf>	so the problem you're having is something else
Mar 22 16:36:54 <n3p>	when I changed "GRUB_ENABLE_BLSCFG=false" then grub2-mkconfig creates a BIOS config and it boots OK
Mar 22 16:37:47 <cmurf>	BLSCFG=false is not creating a BIOS config
Mar 22 16:38:04 <cmurf>	BLS has nothing to do with BIOS vs UEFI
Mar 22 16:41:09 <cmurf>	starting with fedora 34 you should not output grub2-mkconfig to /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg anymore, you should create it at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:41:59 <cmurf>	the installer creates a proper forwarding entry in the /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg that points to /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:42:12 <cmurf>	by stepping on the one on the ESP, you erased it
Mar 22 16:43:42 <n3p>	yes and no
Mar 22 16:43:44 <cmurf>	i suggest you just do a clean install in a VM or something so you can learn how it actually works before you start replacing things
Mar 22 16:44:42 <n3p>	I understand the new relation between /efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg and /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:45:07 <cmurf>	and yet you replaced the correct files with symlinks
Mar 22 16:45:28 <linuxmodder>	due to a flicker it appears
Mar 22 16:45:37 <linuxmodder>	not sure I understand this flicker tho
Mar 22 16:45:49 <cmurf>	i think the flick with 2.06 is a known issue
Mar 22 16:45:55 <cmurf>	s/flick/flicker/
Mar 22 16:45:56 <n3p>	cmurf, I didn't erase (or overwrite) /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 16:46:36 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210315 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Mar 22 16:46:51 <cmurf>	ok well i'm confused, i have no idea what you want to do but it's not a default installation anymore
Mar 22 16:48:07 <n3p>	The failure was with a crean install of grub 2.06  and a "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg"
Mar 22 16:48:15 <linuxmodder>	n3p:  so the flicker you mention is that blip when the mneu is or isnt shown correct?
Mar 22 16:49:27 <n3p>	linuxmodder, no it not an error is grub informing that is loading a config
Mar 22 16:49:36 <cmurf>	n3p instead of giving explanations it'd be better to supply the files in question as i've asked
Mar 22 16:50:13 <cmurf>	i have the setup the way it's intended to be for fedora 34 with grub 2.06 and it's working
Mar 22 16:50:30 <cmurf>	if it's not working for you, something is wrong, but i can't figure it out from you just saying it doesn't work
Mar 22 16:50:33 <cmurf>	i need to see the files
Mar 22 16:53:06 <cmurf>	you can fpaste them
Mar 22 16:58:56 <cmurf>	n3p: can you also fpaste /etc/fstab
Mar 22 17:01:39 <n3p>	cmurf, https://paste.centos.org/view/8fed82d5 https://paste.centos.org/view/9f19fe42  https://paste.centos.org/view/d688333e
Mar 22 17:01:54 <ledeni>	n3p:you upgraded system to f34 not clean install ?
Mar 22 17:03:50 <cmurf>	ok those all look reasonable, of course you need to use the one with blscfg true
Mar 22 17:04:03 <cmurf>	and it should be at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
Mar 22 17:04:30 <cmurf>	and the stub https://paste.centos.org/view/9f19fe42 should be /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
Mar 22 17:06:02 <n3p>	I updated from 33 to 34 and the weekend updated the system testing repos and grub 2.06 that updated/upgraded the configs correctly and boot normal. But when I updated with "grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg" on reboot grub don't read the /boot/loader/ entries and NO *LINUX* BOOT OPTION  appeared just the content of /etc/grub.d/40_custom
Mar 22 17:06:36 <cmurf>	ok so that might be two bugs
Mar 22 17:07:06 <cmurf>	so you had 2.06 working *until* you ran grub2-mkconfig
Mar 22 17:07:36 <cmurf>	have you compared the grub2-mkconfig between 2.04 and 2.06?
Mar 22 17:07:38 <n3p>	cmurf, yes!
Mar 22 17:09:00 <n3p>	cmurf, yes and everything looks almos the same. Just some typo corrections on the comments and blank spaces changes
Mar 22 17:09:27 <cmurf>	that really doesn't make sense
Mar 22 17:09:30 <n3p>	I compared them with meld
Mar 22 17:09:33 <cmurf>	hmmm
Mar 22 17:09:59 <cmurf>	there must be something else going on...
Mar 22 17:10:03 <cmurf>	this is correct https://paste.centos.org/view/5f51c5c4
Mar 22 17:10:29 <cmurf>	line 139 and 140 are what bring in /boot/loader/entries
Mar 22 17:11:19 <n3p>	I thought that could be some BLS patches missing in GRUB 2.06
Mar 22 17:11:42 <cmurf>	no it's working for me like i said
Mar 22 17:12:51 <n3p>	cmurf, working after update with mkconfig?
Mar 22 17:13:40 <ledeni>	n3p➡ cat /etc/default/grub | fpaste
Mar 22 17:15:54 <n3p>	ledeni,  https://paste.centos.org/view/26357087
Mar 22 17:16:14 <cmurf>	diff of my current grub.cfg and a new grub2-mkconfig one   https://paste.centos.org/view/51f192be
Mar 22 17:16:23 <cmurf>	i'm not sure that ; can cause it to fail
Mar 22 17:16:25 <cmurf>	i'll reboot
Mar 22 17:18:33 <n3p>	I have been an ArchLinux since 2009, so I usted to tweak some configs. But usually nothing breaks and fedora upgrades fine. Since 20s versions on my boxes
Mar 22 17:18:58 <cmurf>	ok it still works
Mar 22 17:21:45 <cmurf>	n3p can you comment out of your /etc/default/grub
Mar 22 17:21:47 <cmurf>	GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
Mar 22 17:21:58 <cmurf>	GRUB_FONT="/boot/grub2/fonts/ter-u32b.pf2"
Mar 22 17:22:40 <cmurf>	and create a new grub.cfg with grub2-mkconfig
Mar 22 17:22:43 <cmurf>	and see if that woks
Mar 22 17:22:46 <cmurf>	works
Mar 22 17:22:49 <asterix1324>	Hi, how can I verify the Fedora 34 Beta ISO? There are no GPG keys for F34 in https://getfedora.org/static/fedora.gpg
Mar 22 17:23:00 <cmurf>	test it with grub 2.04 first then 2.06
Mar 22 17:23:54 <cmurf>	asterix1324: website won't be updated until tomorrow, tomorrow is beta release day
Mar 22 17:24:24 <n3p>	cmurf, ok I will do it
Mar 22 17:24:37 <asterix1324>	Okay, then I'll wait until tomorrow. Thank you.

Mar 22 17:36:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	issues
Mar 22 17:37:23 <bootdisk>	for some reason that mirror wants login credentials (spelling :P )
Mar 22 17:37:53 <Southern_Gentlem>	https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mirrormanager/mirrors/Fedora/33
Mar 22 17:38:02 <Minall>	Hello Fedora Community!
Mar 22 17:38:24 <bootdisk>	must be DNS issue, cant reach that page either Southern_Gentlem
Mar 22 17:38:46 <Minall>	I'm an Archlinux user very interested in trying fedora, like Gnome 40 and all... But I will probably just go with XFCE... What are your reasons of choosing Fedora as a main OS?
Mar 22 17:39:19 <coz_>	Minall, consistancy, stability, etc, etc
Mar 22 17:39:54 <Minall>	coz_ Care to elaborate?
Mar 22 17:39:56 <coz_>	Minall, you can try a live iso
Mar 22 17:40:15 <Minall>	Perhaps Gnome boxes would do the trick
Mar 22 17:41:40 <coz_>	Minall, likey, arch is great, especially if you dont have to struggle with installation fedora is no struggle with similar stability
Mar 22 17:41:57 <Southern_Gentlem>	Minall, f34-beta will be released tomorrow
Mar 22 17:42:28 <coz_>	Minall, cant hurt to try it
Mar 22 17:42:46 <Minall>	Whaaat
Mar 22 17:42:50 <Minall>	Just tomorrow?
Mar 22 17:42:56 <coz_>	beta
Mar 22 17:42:58 <Minall>	Imma read a lot about it
Mar 22 17:43:13 <Southern_Gentlem>	beta will be released tomorrow with gnome40 etc
Mar 22 17:43:18 <Minall>	And then the stable version will come 24 right?...
Mar 22 17:43:42 <Minall>	Perhaps I can install Fedora and try it, but, should I wait for the stable release?
Mar 22 17:44:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	the F34 will be released apirl 20 or 27th
Mar 22 17:44:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	grab the beta tomorrow and try it in a vm
Mar 22 17:44:34 <coz_>	Minall, probably, however, I have run pre release with no issues, up to you
Mar 22 17:44:42 <Minall>	Sure!... Thank you for your opinions... coz_, Southern_Gentlem
Mar 22 17:44:44 <Southern_Gentlem>	if you like it you can install it and it will become the final with updates
Mar 22 17:45:21 <coz_>	Minall, probably a good idea to install remfusion as well
Mar 22 17:45:39 <Minall>	Yeah, like to 'stable' it I just had to update when the full release is out?
Mar 22 17:45:45 <coz_>	rpmfusion
Mar 22 17:46:06 <Minall>	Btw one question I had in earlier releases, about why Fedora updates like any other OS, while in Archlinux you can keep working while upgrading
Mar 22 17:46:12 <Minall>	Thank you coz_, imma check on that
Mar 22 17:46:16 <coz_>	Minall, yep sudo dnf upgade --refresh should do it
Mar 22 17:46:33 <Minall>	Cool

Mar 22 19:20:23 <OnlyHuman>	ahh new spin-kickstart files for f34 then
Mar 22 19:26:34 <rudrab>	hi, just curious: why gnome developer find it sane to only way to access the app menu is to click on activities on top left, and travel all the way to near of bottom right?
Mar 22 19:26:59 <rudrab>	unless there is dash-to dock for 40, its hard to use

Mar 22 19:36:35 <bootdisk>	Southern_Gentlem there must be issue with fedora website from EU, using a proxy from US now, and it works

Mar 22 19:48:41 <Han>	oops
Mar 22 19:49:19 <bitchkat>	When I put my laptop in the docking station with the lid closed, it seems like its not actually disabling the built in display until I log in.  THis means the log in UI isn't display on either of my external monitors and I have to log in blind.
Mar 22 20:07:52 <dowdle>	bitchkat: Different DEs have different settings for what happens when you close the lid.  Most go to sleep... but you can check your settings.
Mar 22 20:08:58 <bitchkat>	In this case, the lid is never opened.  I put it in my docking station with the lid close and then hit the power button on the dock.
Mar 22 20:09:41 <bitchkat>	During boot up, everything likes normal but once the gnome login screen comes up, its using the laptop display.
Mar 22 20:10:23 <bitchkat>	and when I blindly hit Enter and then my password, its logs in fine and the laptop display is not being used.
Mar 22 20:11:44 <Peetz0r>	blindly typing in passwords, what could possibly... :p
Mar 22 20:12:58 <Peetz0r>	But the component that should be displaying the login screen is gdm, so you may want to file a bug over there

Mar 23 11:38:22 <Guest36435>	I have a problem with KDE
Mar 23 11:38:33 <Guest36435>	every page that is out of focus is blurry
Mar 23 11:38:44 <Guest36435>	anyone knows how to fix it?
Mar 23 11:38:51 <Flexyjerkov>	o/
Mar 23 11:39:04 <Guest36435>	o/
Mar 23 11:39:38 <Flexyjerkov>	Guest36435: you should probably provide a little more details, what Desktop Environment you're using, fedora version and so on :)
Mar 23 11:39:50 <Guest36435>	fedora 33, KDE

Mar 23 11:41:03 <Guest36435>	gotta have le specs
Mar 23 11:41:12 <akik>	Guest36435: that sounds like a desktop effect gone rogue. check systemsettings/workspace behavior/desktop effects
Mar 23 11:41:16 <Flexyjerkov>	fedora/kde and gpu was probably sufficient ;), personally i'm not sure on the issue.
Mar 23 11:41:51 <Flexyjerkov>	akik: i got him to try forcing DPI to 92 although the issue does appear to be the whole GUI that's blurring when not focused
Mar 23 11:42:24 <Flexyjerkov>	https://i.imgur.com/Rx3hd7F.jpg is what he's getting
Mar 23 11:42:57 <Flexyjerkov>	i sent him over to Fedora as i'm just a peasent Arch user ;)
Mar 23 11:43:11 <akik>	Flexyjerkov: so make him change it back?
Mar 23 11:43:23 <Flexyjerkov>	it makes no difference akik
Mar 23 11:43:35 <Flexyjerkov>	it appears to be the whole UI, not font specific

Mar 23 11:44:33 <Flexyjerkov>	akik: the only other thing is he's just installed KDE instead of using Gnome, wern't sure if it's a compositor issue
Mar 23 11:45:47 <Guest36435>	maybe a reinstall fixes it eh
Mar 23 11:45:55 <Guest36435>	how would i go by of doing so
Mar 23 11:46:09 <akik>	Guest36435: useradd, not reinstall

Mar 23 11:54:53 <Guest36435>	i just tried making everything defaults
Mar 23 11:54:53 <akik>	Guest36435: one way would be to reset it by removing two directories
Mar 23 11:55:07 <Guest36435>	go on bossman
Mar 23 11:55:55 <akik>	Guest36435: ~/.config has a lot of different program configs, but if the reset is ok then; rm -rf ~/.kde ~/.config # as your normal user

Mar 23 11:57:00 <Guest36435>	including the hashtag

Mar 23 11:57:41 <akik>	Guest36435: just that "rm -rf ~/.kde ~/.config" the hash just makes it so that nothing after is executed
Mar 23 11:58:17 <Guest36435>	you sure that reinstalling it wont fix it
Mar 23 11:58:29 <akik>	Guest36435: sure it'll fix it but it's not needed

Mar 23 12:10:58 <akik>	Flexyjerkov: i use dd
Mar 23 12:11:07 <kiwi_97>	yea dd is available
Mar 23 12:11:16 <akik>	fedora media writer is something
Mar 23 12:11:41 <kiwi_97>	how do i use dd
Mar 23 12:11:53 <_janos>	very very carefully
Mar 23 12:11:57 <Flexyjerkov>	dd if=~/Downloads/anarchy-1.1.0-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sd* (remove * and replace for drive letter)
Mar 23 12:12:29 <Flexyjerkov>	put in usb stick and do a df to find the name of the USB drive
Mar 23 12:13:27 <Flexyjerkov>	dd is a scary tool :P
Mar 23 12:13:58 <kiwi_97>	how do i know what drive letter it is
Mar 23 12:14:14 <_janos>	lsblk is how i typically do discovery
Mar 23 12:14:51 <Flexyjerkov>	kiwi one easy way is use "gnome-disks"
Mar 23 12:15:11 <Flexyjerkov>	click on the drive and it'll show it's details
Mar 23 12:15:46 <kiwi_97>	okay imma hop into gnome now because the blurriness is making me frustrated
Mar 23 12:16:09 <Flexyjerkov>	oh how it's fun to be new to Linux ;)
Mar 23 12:17:28 <Flexyjerkov>	so... what's fedora like these days, I've not touched it since Fedore Core 4?
Mar 23 12:18:40 <kiwi_97>	heya im back
Mar 23 12:18:47 <Flexyjerkov>	hi
Mar 23 12:18:47 <kiwi_97>	fedora had a tool for iso writing
Mar 23 12:19:08 <Flexyjerkov>	well there u go :D
Mar 23 12:19:35 <kiwi_97>	i am just writing the iso rn and ill be back in half an hour depending how long it takes to install tihngs
Mar 23 12:19:47 <Flexyjerkov>	some of us prefer "minimal/lean" ;) i don't have any unnessasary tools
Mar 23 12:20:02 <kiwi_97>	so that anarchy iso you sent me
Mar 23 12:20:05 <kiwi_97>	its arch yea
Mar 23 12:20:08 <Flexyjerkov>	ye
Mar 23 12:20:13 <Flexyjerkov>	it's a "easy" installer for arch
Mar 23 12:20:19 <kiwi_97>	cool
Mar 23 12:20:21 <kiwi_97>	thx bro
Mar 23 12:20:22 <Flexyjerkov>	but it'll give you choice on everything you want
Mar 23 12:20:30 <kiwi_97>	see you ina bit
Mar 23 12:21:28 <Flexyjerkov>	"and that's the last we see of kiwi"... I do wonder why the new users always jump to arch.. it's gotta be the "I USE ARCH BTW" meme ;)
Mar 23 12:25:09 <violoncelloch>	well I'm considering switching the other way
Mar 23 12:25:23 <Flexyjerkov>	from Arch to Fedora?
Mar 23 12:26:03 <aaa__[m]>	<Flexyjerkov "so... what's fedora like these d"> it's fine
Mar 23 12:26:12 <violoncelloch>	Flexyjerkov: yes... the only thing that bothers me is that not all software is easily installable (e.g. kdenlive I can't find in the repos, nor in copr)
Mar 23 12:26:17 <aaa__[m]>	maybe a bit "bloated", but i dont care honestly. works well
Mar 23 12:26:44 <MollyM[m]>	as someone who switched from arch to fedora, i would have stayed on arch if i had the time to keep an eye on all my packages and shit.
Mar 23 12:27:03 <MollyM[m]>	jonas cant u u$e flatpaks?
Mar 23 12:27:15 <Flexyjerkov>	i've considered a jump back to Debian myself a few times as i still use it for servers etc but Arch just works for me
Mar 23 12:27:24 <Flexyjerkov>	+ AUR packages are perfect
Mar 23 12:27:51 <akik>	i don't use arch but isn't it a bit more involved distro, breaking more often ?
Mar 23 12:28:03 <Flexyjerkov>	i've never had arch break on me
Mar 23 12:28:04 <aaa__[m]>	<Flexyjerkov "+ AUR packages are perfect"> i find AUR great as well
Mar 23 12:28:14 <Flexyjerkov>	i do use timeshift for on boot backups though.
Mar 23 12:28:22 <Flexyjerkov>	in the event i need to recover the system
Mar 23 12:28:59 <Flexyjerkov>	and keep the odd previous kernel if the latest/greatest isn't all that great ;)
Mar 23 12:28:59 <violoncelloch>	Molly M.: I guess I could.. (if that doesn't affect performance, as that's critical for a video editor - and I know that the snap of kdenlive is way too slow)
Mar 23 12:28:59 <violoncelloch>	also where would I get it from? the fedora flathub repo or would I need to add flathub as a source?
Mar 23 12:31:36 <Flexyjerkov>	personally i'd never use Arch on a server though, I use Debian/Ubuntu for all servers or used to be CentOS just because it's tried n tested and i can be sure that the system wont just fall over
Mar 23 12:31:55 <Flexyjerkov>	Arch being a rolling system is a little more of a roll of the dice.
Mar 23 12:33:36 <MollyM[m]>	jonas Fedora comes with flathub as a source independently i believe. i havent tried installing kdenlive yet so im not sure but i bet if u search kdenlive flathub or kdenlive rpm ull find it
Mar 23 12:37:42 <Mershl[m]>	@airlied @pwalters is tomorrows mesa stable update 21.0.1 planned to be released for Fedora 33?

Mar 23 16:19:29 <violoncelloch>	thanks dowdle
Mar 23 16:20:18 <dowdle>	violoncelloch: I've noticed that in KDE Plasma, their Discover tool... is very good and notifying me when there are flatpak updates and letting me do them from its gui.
Mar 23 16:20:34 <dowdle>	Err... good AT notifying
Mar 23 16:21:45 <violoncelloch>	yes, Gnome Software also notifies about and handles flatpak updates

Mar 23 16:28:55 <Khaytsus>	I'm kind of surprised that dnf doens't support at least tying into flatpak's tools given it's use in Silverblue
Mar 23 16:31:13 <jcmdln>	Silverblue documents using flatpak, then os-tree if you really want a system-level dependency. I like that dnf and flatpak are separate, unlike apt + snap
Mar 23 16:33:28 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, separate agree, but would be nice to manage them together if you prefer.  but I suppose doing an update on two things is not that big a deal.

Mar 23 16:48:05 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210315 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Mar 23 16:52:38 <dowdle>	matteo: I don't have ldapsearch installed... and I don't know the details of the AD hosts which I'm guessing would be needed to use the tool.  Things like "getent passwd $username" and "getent group $groupname" work fairly well.
Mar 23 16:52:40 <Southern_Gentlem>	so matrix is doing its daily constitutional
Mar 23 16:53:55 <dowdle>	matteo: I found out from the Windows command line I can do "net user $username /domain" and it'll give me a bunch of output that includes the password expiration date.  There is a chage command for checking password related info but it isn't AD aware.

Mar 23 19:04:26 <OnlyHuman>	hi does anyone else have  problem with vbox graphics on f33 with kernel 5.11.* when using a live iso?
Mar 23 19:20:48 <bramgn[m]>	What kind of problem
Mar 23 19:25:32 <OnlyHuman>	when click on a menu the mouse  highlights maybe 3menu items higher
Mar 23 19:27:10 <OnlyHuman>	maybe it is just the iso I made bit awkward but can correct it once can get to screensetup that fixes it
Mar 23 19:28:30 <OnlyHuman>	will try sometime to see if can put it on a usb stick an boot pc,
Mar 23 19:30:03 <dowdle>	OnlyHuman: I can test it under KVM if you want to see if I can duplicate.  If not, it is probably a VirtualBox specific thing.
Mar 23 19:31:27 <dowdle>	OnlyHuman: So you can share an iso if you want me to test... (Respin SIG's next build will be that kernel or newer but not on most recent media)... or I can build my own F33 remix which might take a little while.
Mar 23 19:33:54 <OnlyHuman>	thanks for offer dowdle but just thought mention it  but suspect others may not have the prblem the devs would know if there was aprob
Mar 23 19:34:40 <dowdle>	OnlyHuman: Actually, since the respin sig hasn't built it... you'd have to encounter someone here who has... and I'm guessing there isn't anyone.
Mar 23 19:35:47 <OnlyHuman>	no  worries thanks dowdle, just been messing with git enlightenment
Mar 23 19:36:08 <dowdle>	OnlyHuman: I'm due for a rebuild of my own remix so I'll let you know if I notice an oddity.

Mar 23 19:42:38 <OnlyHuman>	but fedora do lots of updates so is it about a week old
Mar 23 19:42:49 <dowdle>	:)
Mar 23 19:44:28 <spikhoff>	Hi, i'm running silverblue and after I rebased to 34 i'm getting some random instability, total system lockup, audio goes to loop and keyboard doesn't respond (can't turn caps-lock on) etc, what could be the problem?

Mar 23 20:06:27 <dowdle>	spikhoff: F33 updated to the same kernel version (5.11.7) so I wonder if you'd have the same issue on F33 as well?  Seems to be a regression in CPU-related stuff?
Mar 23 20:19:18 <frandavid100>	Guys, where are flatpak apps installed? I'm trying to find Firefox's profile directories in order to get [this theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) installed
Mar 23 20:19:45 <frandavid100>	Which I really think should be installed by default. It makes Firefox look really at home in a Gnome environment

Mar 23 20:28:33 <linuxmodder>	frandavid100: there is for that use the builtin theme manager in the flatpak firefox curious why you'd flatpak firefox anyways
Mar 23 20:28:34 <dowdle>	frandavid100: I would HOPE that when you run a flatpak, it writes stuff to your home directory for your personalized settings... as a user shouldn't write to /var/lib/ but I'm not certain.
Mar 23 20:29:03 <gnafu>	dowdle, frandavid100: I think you'll find it under ~/.local/share/flatpak.
Mar 23 20:29:43 <frandavid100>	<linuxmodder "David Prieto: there is for that "> Basically for Netflix. DRM doesn't seem to work in regular FF
Mar 23 20:29:45 <dowdle>	frandavid100: And I'd expect if you put stuff under /var/lib/flatpak/ it might get messed with on future updates?!
Mar 23 20:30:07 <frandavid100>	That particular theme apparently isn't in the theme manager, by the way
Mar 23 20:30:12 <dowdle>	frandavid100: Works fine for me in Firefox if you install some rpmfusion provided codec packages.
Mar 23 20:30:30 <gnafu>	(Wait, maybe not.)
Mar 23 20:30:37 <dowdle>	frandavid100: By works I mean Netflix in distro packaged firefox.
Mar 23 20:31:09 <gnafu>	I've found Netflix works in Firefox on stock Fedora without installing RPM Fusion.
Mar 23 20:31:19 <gnafu>	You just need OpenH264.
Mar 23 20:32:02 <frandavid100>	<gnafu "You just need OpenH264."> Oh, nice. It didn't work the last time I tried, but I'll try again
Mar 23 20:32:41 <gnafu>	Also, Netflix appears to be using VP9 more and more so H.264 decoding isn't even needed for some content.
Mar 23 20:32:49 <linuxmodder>	DRM is a setting in firefox preferences,please try to do some homework before getting lazy
Mar 23 20:33:12 <frandavid100>	I will
Mar 23 20:34:07 <dowdle>	Hey now, there isn't anything wrong with using flatpaks... especially if one wants to have multiple firefox installed (or any other application).
Mar 23 20:34:28 <linuxmodder>	frandavid100: install x264/x265 dnf groupupdate multimedia and enabled DRM content in about:preferences
Mar 23 20:35:08 <gnafu>	Aah, ~/.var/app is where you should find user-level Flatpak stuff.
Mar 23 20:35:47 <frandavid100>	Thanks a lot 😀
Mar 23 20:37:16 <gnafu>	frandavid100: Sure thing!  Specifically, I guess it's ~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.

Mar 23 20:53:02 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	can someone explain what "Software" program in Fedora GNOME is? Is it like helper for dnf? or is it it's own thing? is it like pamac for pacman?
Mar 23 20:53:30 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	or is it like dnfdragora but different
Mar 23 20:55:19 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: It's a software manager that only manages some software.... mostly GNOME related... and mostly GUI-related stuff.  It is not a general purpose package manager.
Mar 23 20:56:24 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: It also does updates what is considered the correct way these days... downloads everything and if needed will reboot the computer into an upgrade mode... do the upgrade and then give the graphical login back.  With dnf running inside of a GUI (unless under screen or tmux), there is always the risk of crashing something and messing up your package manager run.
Mar 23 20:56:28 <Southern_Gentlem>	and its packagekit
Mar 23 20:57:27 <cmurf>	yeah Software uses PackageKit which I think is using libdnf to manipulate the rpm database but it's not using dnf itself or the dnf metadata cache
Mar 23 20:57:36 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	but if I download everything GNOME-related with CLI dnf, I'm also good to go?
Mar 23 20:57:39 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I don't use GNOME and still run dnf within my desktop environments (either KDE Plasma or XFCE) but I do so in tmux... so if the GUI were to crash, I can hopefully switch to text-based console and pick up where I left off.  I haven't really had my GUI crash in quite a long time, but the posibility exists...and you don't want your package manager to be aborted.
Mar 23 20:57:40 <cmurf>	/var/cache/dnf and /var/cache/PackageKit are separate
Mar 23 20:57:54 <MollyM[m]>	total side matter: have any of y'all had any difficulties with using open-jdk? i tried installing it last night on fedora 33 -- namely openjdk-latest for the x86_64 platform -- and that didnt seem to do much of anything.
Mar 23 20:57:55 <cmurf>	yeah you can  use either
Mar 23 20:58:06 <cmurf>	the canonical database of what's installed is still the rpm database
Mar 23 20:59:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	MollyM[m], i only use whats in the Fedora repos now a days, i dont have a need to install from other sources
Mar 23 21:00:33 <dowdle>	MollyM[m]: Elaborate on "didn't seem to do much of anything".
Mar 23 21:00:55 <dowdle>	Southern_Gentlem: I'd love to... but I needs me some ffmpeg.
Mar 23 21:02:45 <DTEIT>	hi everyone...is anyone using wofi with sway?
Mar 23 21:03:24 <qrsBRWN[m]>	Yes
Mar 23 21:03:26 <qrsBRWN[m]>	Works well
Mar 23 21:03:28 <spikhoff>	dowdle, I'm wondering how long 34 has been on 5.11.7, because I been running 34 like week or so and I started noticing lockup's in few days ago. I don't have 33 in my boot menu anymore to test it out. I also tried to 'rebase' to 33 but that won't work
Mar 23 21:03:53 <DTEIT>	qrsBRWN[m]: do you maybe use some executables in other places than usual?
Mar 23 21:04:11 <Southern_Gentlem>	spikhoff, like yesterday
Mar 23 21:04:18 <DTEIT>	I have some scripts in ~/bin which wofi doesn't pick up
Mar 23 21:06:31 <qrsBRWN[m]>	Which mode and how does your PATH look?
Mar 23 21:07:07 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	hey I'm trying to set keybinding shortcut for gnome terminal
Mar 23 21:07:13 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	which command should I use?
Mar 23 21:08:00 <DTEIT>	qrsBRWN[m]: by moe you mean "--show run"?
Mar 23 21:08:37 <DTEIT>	and $PATH looks fine, I can run them from any terminal
Mar 23 21:10:08 <Southern_Gentlem>	Yourmomuwu[m], in gnome-shell keyboard shortcuts
Mar 23 21:11:29 <Southern_Gentlem>	spikhoff, you should be able to boot into an older kernel and i see 5.11.8 in updates-testing you can try
Mar 23 21:11:48 <cmurf>	btw python3-dnf-plugin-system-upgrade provides system-upgrade offline-upgrade offline-distrosync
Mar 23 21:12:13 <cmurf>	the nomenclature there is a bit confusing, but the last two do same release version "updates"
Mar 23 21:12:34 <cmurf>	but they do it the same way as system-upgrade where you have first a download subcommand followed by reboot
Mar 23 21:12:57 <qrsBRWN[m]>	<DTEIT "and $PATH looks fine, I can run "> Then I would probably check the wofi docs
Mar 23 21:13:13 <cmurf>	and it does the actual work in a minimalist boot, like system-upgrade (which does major release version changes)
Mar 23 21:13:37 <DTEIT>	qrsBRWN[m]: yeah I tried to read a bit buth there's no mention about path
Mar 23 21:13:41 <qrsBRWN[m]>	Also, the PATH in interactive shells may differ from noninteractive ones
Mar 23 21:14:40 <DTEIT>	qrsBRWN[m]: uhm...good point
Mar 23 21:20:56 <dowdle>	spikhoff: rpm -qi packagename will tell you went it was built/installed.
Mar 23 21:21:15 <spikhoff>	Southern_Gentlem, thanks, I'll try that. It seems to only happen when there is low-load on system, I guess c-state change may trigger it
Mar 23 21:21:26 *	sauvin_ is now known as Boc
Mar 23 21:21:52 <cmurf>	oh and the system-upgrade plugin is now installed by default in f34, but of course you can just 'dnf install' it on older releases
Mar 23 21:22:45 <spikhoff>	I have currently over 2h uptime and still no lockup
Mar 23 21:24:06 <spikhoff>	I guess I continue digging further tomorrow
Mar 23 21:35:40 <MollyM[m]>	dowdle to elaborate. i was trying to run a .jar file and upon trying to open it as an executable it only allows itself to open as an archive or just not at all. i tried installing openjdk but that didnt change anything
Mar 23 21:39:22 <dowdle>	MollyM[m]: You are trying to double-click on a jar file in your file manager?  Or running "java -jar whatever.jar"?

Mar 23 22:08:00 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	why does my dnfdragora crash constantly on fresh Fedora gnome install
Mar 23 22:12:47 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: A "fresh Fedora gnome install" if you used the download media link from getfedora.org probably has about as many GB of updates that need to be applied as the download size of the install media.  Have you updated?  Or did you use a respin download link in channel topic?
Mar 23 22:16:02 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: dnfdragora doesn't seem to be present on a stock GNOME install.
Mar 23 22:17:39 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: So I assume you installed it, and IT at least should be current.
Mar 23 22:20:41 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I don't use it and I just booted a Fedora WORKSTATION respin that is fairly current... and manually installed dnfdragora... and it isn't crashing on me... BUT I don't know what I'm doing with it.
Mar 23 22:21:15 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: It's user interface has me lost... as I was just going to try and check for updates... but can't discover how to do anything really.
Mar 23 22:22:41 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I guess it is presenting a complete list of all packages in a hierarchy on the left... so I can see what's installed and what isn't... and can install and remove from that list.
Mar 23 22:26:26 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	solved it
Mar 23 22:26:51 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: And then I quit the program and loaded it again... and it is just sitting there... pretty much all blank.  Maybe it is loading metadata in the background again... even though it just had a fresh copy a minute ago?  Or maybe something else on the system is pulling metadata and it is silently blocked just waiting?!?
Mar 23 22:27:18 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	I try installing skype, but it constantly asks me to install dependency libatomic1
Mar 23 22:27:36 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	how do I install that?
Mar 23 22:28:01 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: You installing Skype from flathub with flatpak?
Mar 23 22:28:18 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	I don't use flatpaks or snaps
Mar 23 22:28:31 *	bootdisk_ is now known as bootdisk
Mar 23 22:28:34 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: No idea then.
Mar 23 22:28:36 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	I have .rpm file downloaded from skype website
Mar 23 22:28:52 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	but I need to resolve dependencies
Mar 23 22:29:02 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I guess their build is old and wants some dependency no in Fedora or and not provided by Skype.
Mar 23 22:30:03 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Maybe try: rpm -qip /path/skype-package-name.rpm and see if you can get any indicator of what it was built for.  Just because something is an RPM doesn't mean it will install.
Mar 23 22:30:42 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: There is a Skype flatpak... and I assume that works... although I haven't tried it.
Mar 23 22:31:30 <Khaytsus>	Yep, just use hte flatpak.
Mar 23 22:31:47 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	I mean I refuse to use flatpaks, that's why I need to install from .rpm file
Mar 23 22:32:08 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Well then, I guess you'll have to find an rpm that works.
Mar 23 22:32:18 <Khaytsus>	k, GL.
Mar 23 22:32:28 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: But out of curiousity, what is the build date listed in the rpm -qip output?
Mar 23 22:33:11 <dowdle>	 (-qi means query information about a package... and the p means, for a package that isn't currently installed with you passing the filename to it so it can peak inside.
Mar 23 22:33:15 <dowdle>	 )
Mar 23 22:33:41 <modlin>	Can confirm, Skype flatpak is ok. It even has tray icon in Gnome, providing you have appindicator support extension...
Mar 23 22:34:19 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<dowdle "Your mom uwu: Maybe try: rpm -qi"> does it matter if I start command with dnf instead or rpm
Mar 23 22:34:42 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: There is probably a dnf alternative to rpm -qi but but rpm should work fine.
Mar 23 22:35:04 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Probably dnf info /path/packagename would work?
Mar 23 22:35:19 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<dowdle "Your mom uwu: But out of curious"> build date 12 Feb 2021
Mar 23 22:35:56 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Well, at least it is fairly recent.  And you downloaded it from Microsoft?
Mar 23 22:36:16 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Please provide download URL.
Mar 23 22:36:26 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	yeah
Mar 23 22:36:30 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	skype.com
Mar 23 22:36:32 *	dowdle notes that dnfdragora finally did show data... it just took a while.
Mar 23 22:37:09 <dowdle>	Since I have a VM running live media... doesn't hurt to try myself to install the rpm.
Mar 23 22:37:38 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	okay so what are my options for installing that dependency
Mar 23 22:37:48 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<dowdle "Since I have a VM running live m"> that would be very helpful
Mar 23 22:38:49 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Darn it, I don't have enough free disk space in the live session to download the RPM.
Mar 23 22:39:47 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	doesn't matter
Mar 23 22:39:55 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	I'll figure it out
Mar 23 22:40:11 <linuxmodder>	dowdle: use a external maybe?  and sudo dnf install /path/to/external/foo.rpm ?
Mar 23 22:40:40 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I'll try it on my own system... and take one for the team.
Mar 23 22:40:48 <linuxmodder>	what rpm ?
Mar 23 22:40:52 <Khaytsus>	I just don't understand the hate for flatpak.  No I won't use it if there's a _valid_ RPM out there.  But using a random RPM isn't any good either.  MS hasn't exactly done a stellar job of providing any sane RPMs.
Mar 23 22:41:00 <Khaytsus>	And does this not work?  https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-skype/
Mar 23 22:41:57 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: You ain't going to get it to install... because "dnf provides libatomic1" gives no results... unless you are just going to randomly hunt down an rpm not provided by Fedora that offers that up.
Mar 23 22:42:09 <dowdle>	 Error: No Matches found
Mar 23 22:43:52 <linuxmodder>	Yourmomuwu[m]: sudo dnf install https://repo.skype.com/rpm/stable/skypeforlinux_8.69.0.77-1.x86_64.rpm
Mar 23 22:43:55 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Maybe they provide a repo that has the deps needed, but if so, they aren't saying so with their simple download link.  Atomic is the name of the Red Hat project that came before CoreOS... although maybe that is some other libatomic?!?
Mar 23 22:44:12 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<Khaytsus "And does this not work?  https:/"> wow thank you this worked
Mar 23 22:44:28 <Khaytsus>	o_O  What were you doing before?
Mar 23 22:44:40 <linuxmodder>	Yourmomuwu[m]: install the repo first and that will install the needed deps as well
Mar 23 22:45:14 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: That command you gave didn't work... and still fails with the same missing dep.
Mar 23 22:45:27 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<Khaytsus "o_O  What were you doing before?"> https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/
Mar 23 22:45:55 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<linuxmodder "Your mom uwu: install the repo f"> yeah I just followed the docs, it worked
Mar 23 22:46:37 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Btw, your Matrix client is spitting out a bunch of quoting gibberish.
Mar 23 22:46:47 <dowdle>	EXAMPLE:
Mar 23 22:46:52 <dowdle>	[15:45] <Yourmomuwu[m]> <linuxmodder "Your mom uwu: install the repo f"> yeah I just followed the docs, it worked
Mar 23 22:46:53 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	<dowdle "Your mom uwu: Btw, your Matrix c"> hmmm
Mar 23 22:47:09 <Khaytsus>	they are the same file...
Mar 23 22:47:47 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	omg I hate element client, always some problems
Mar 23 22:47:49 <dowdle>	Khaytsus: The instructions on the Fedora wiki page say to download / install the skype repo file and then install the package... and that provides access to additional packages including the needed deps.
Mar 23 22:48:31 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210315 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Mar 23 22:48:42 <Khaytsus>	I don't see anything else in their repo..
Mar 23 22:49:04 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	yeah, .rpm file in repo doesn't enable dependencies
Mar 23 22:49:20 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	* yeah, .rpm file on skype website doesn't enable dependencies
Mar 23 22:49:51 <Khaytsus>	Nope...  It's just installing the older version.
Mar 23 22:50:12 <Khaytsus>	8.69 is requiring whatever libatomic is, 8.68 does not.
Mar 23 22:50:21 <dowdle>	One has to wonder what libatomic1 the newer build is depending on?!?
Mar 23 22:50:32 <Khaytsus>	MSBS.
Mar 23 22:51:04 <Khaytsus>	It's in suse, so I bet they're building the RPMs on suse
Mar 23 22:51:12 <Khaytsus>	TIL people still use suse.
Mar 23 22:52:53 <linuxmodder>	Yourmomuwu[m]: sudo dnf whatdepends libatomic1
Mar 23 22:53:02 <linuxmodder>	that is a command not a statement
Mar 23 22:53:22 <dowdle>	 (or "provides")
Mar 23 22:54:09 <dowdle>	linuxmodder: whatdepends doesn't work for me.
Mar 23 22:55:02 <Khaytsus>	If you google libatomic1 you just find suse results.
Mar 23 22:55:04 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	wow now skype prompts me to install updates
Mar 23 22:55:27 <Yourmomuwu[m]>	microsoft and the most dumbest piece of software
Mar 23 22:56:26 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Well, suse uses rpms and they didn't say what distro it was for.
Mar 23 22:57:04 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: Now, does it actually work.... that's the question.
Mar 23 22:57:35 <dowdle>	rpm is not a distro agnostic packaging format.  But you know what is? :)
Mar 23 22:59:36 <linuxmodder>	generally suse rpmsdont play nice with fedora/rhel ones
Mar 23 23:03:28 <d9k>	i wouldnt install that rpm, https://0x0.st/-q1G.txt
Mar 23 23:03:57 <mojo_[m]>	<linuxmodder "generally suse rpmsdont play nic"> this
Mar 23 23:04:02 <mojo_[m]>	I've tried many times
Mar 23 23:04:04 <d9k>	random provides for bundled libs and installs repos in postin
Mar 23 23:04:57 <d9k>	also wtf atd?
Mar 23 23:07:13 <dowdle>	Doing a "ldd /usr/share/skypeforlinux/skypeforlinux" shows it is linked against 100 dynamiclly linked libs... with nothing missing... but the chances of Fedora having the same versions of things and all of those dlls working perfectly... not very high in my uninformed opinion.
Mar 23 23:10:00 <dowdle>	Yourmomuwu[m]: So your statement should be, "I don't use flatpaks when I can find rpms built specifically for Fedora and hopefully for the version of Fedora I'm running".
Mar 23 23:13:01 <dowdle>	d9k: What stands out to you from the output you linked to?  For me it is the ffmpeg reference.  Sure I have ffmpeg installed from rpmfusion... so maybe that's why it didn't complain about that?
Mar 23 23:14:05 <d9k>	it "provides" bundled libraries as system libraries so stuff depending on those will break
Mar 23 23:14:14 <d9k>	also wtf stuff like 'application()' ??
Mar 23 23:14:30 <d9k>	but this atd stuff is some a+ intern code
Mar 23 23:14:40 <d9k>	"code"
Mar 23 23:15:39 <dowdle>	No... it actually bundles its own copy of ffmpeg - libffmpeg.so => /usr/share/skypeforlinux/libffmpeg.so (0x00007f7f837da000)
Mar 23 23:16:21 <d9k>	yes but it certainly doesnt provide libffmpeg
Mar 23 23:16:56 <dowdle>	d9k: Google Chrome Stable does the atd stuff too.. .and Skype seems to have some chrome related pieces.  My guess it is a stripped down Chrome themed to be Skype.
Mar 23 23:17:10 <dowdle>	d9k:  /usr/share/skypeforlinux/libffmpeg.so isn't libffmpeg?
Mar 23 23:17:45 <dowdle>	 (or a stripped down Chromium)
Mar 23 23:18:29 <dowdle>	/usr/share/skypeforlinux/LICENSES.chromium.html, /usr/share/skypeforlinux/chrome-sandbox, /usr/share/skypeforlinux/chrome_100_percent.pak, /usr/share/skypeforlinux/chrome_200_percent.pak
Mar 23 23:19:33 <d9k>	it shouldnt be there is what im saying since nothing should ever use it outside of the package
Mar 23 23:19:43 <dowdle>	That's what Microsoft Teams for Linux is also... a Chromium-app.
Mar 23 23:20:23 <dowdle>	Oh look. /usr/share/teams/libffmpeg.so
Mar 23 23:22:06 <dowdle>	Perhaps they'll update those to use Microsoft Edge for Linux rather than Chromium.
Mar 23 23:23:00 <dowdle>	And... lastly, Microsoft Code also includes a copy of libffmpeg
Mar 23 23:23:08 <d9k>	of course you have n+1 ffmpegs
Mar 23 23:23:11 <d9k>	lol
Mar 23 23:23:37 <dowdle>	d9k: Since each additional libffmpeg is in an application specific directory, it won't conflict with the system lib from the rpmfusion package.
Mar 23 23:23:37 <d9k>	and chromium \o/
Mar 23 23:24:06 <d9k>	no it wont conflict but you have multiple provides of the same thing which none of are correct
Mar 23 23:25:17 *	dowdle removes foreign skypeforlinux rpm
Mar 23 23:27:35 <d9k>	https://0x0.st/-qj8.txt the entire thing
Mar 23 23:44:06 <cmurf>	this is kinda interesting, in 5.11.8

Mar 24 11:26:38 <Xeroine>	IPFreely you just need to enable USB debugging in developer options in settings on your phone, you need to tap the build number several times and it will enable them. then enable USB debugging, install android tools on PC then reconnect phone with your PC and run "adb devices" and I think it'll show you a prompt on your phone to accept something,
Mar 24 11:26:38 <Xeroine>	then you can "adb push $somefile $somedirectory" and "adb pull $somefile $somedirectory" where $somefile is the file you want to push or pull to/from your phone
Mar 24 11:26:48 <Xeroine>	you can keep libmtp installed if you want
Mar 24 11:27:07 <Xeroine>	I don't think it'll cause any issues

Mar 24 12:14:26 <Gargoyle>	Hey all. Not a fedora problem directly, but a google search turns up a page in the fedora wiki, so I thought I would ask in here. I've got a system with 4GB RAM and it's using swap-on-zram with a size % of 175 and a mem limit of 75%. This seems a little agressive compared to what the wiki says, does anyone else here have any experience?
Mar 24 12:19:01 <Gargoyle>	Probably also worth mentioning that the system in question dies a very ungraceful death of swap thrashing followed by a reboot every 2-3 days.
Mar 24 12:49:19 <fedbot>	*** F33-20210315 updated lives available: https://tinyurl.com/Live-respins2 Built by the Fedora Respin Sig more info #fedora-respins ***
Mar 24 13:09:34 <Khaytsus>	Gargoyle: Look for the zram-generator config file?  I honestly have not looked at that, at all.  Perhaps small ram sizes aren't well supported
Mar 24 13:10:52 <Khaytsus>	I see it in /usr/lib/systemd/zram-generator.conf and on 34B it defaults to 1.0 and max ram 8096 (8g I assume?)
Mar 24 13:11:36 <Khaytsus>	Gargoyle: But beyond that, might watch for cmurf, he's the expert there and might be able to help understand why it seems to be allocating more than it should be
Mar 24 13:17:04 <Gargoyle>	Thanks Khaytsus. The values have been set by the vendor in /etc/init.d/S00zram. (it's a busybox based system). I've just seen articles ranging from 3:1 compression is possible, to 2.1:1 is average/default. But it's all just numbers in the air unless you have an idea of what the actual contents of the RAM are. If you've got 2Gigs of H.264 video in ram, you are not going to get 3:1 when it gets paged out to zram.
Mar 24 13:17:31 <Gargoyle>	I just wondered if anyone had any real-world experience with various values.
Mar 24 13:18:04 <Khaytsus>	Gargoyle: huh?  so.... not running Fedora?
Mar 24 13:19:47 <Gargoyle>	Nope. But top hit on google for swap-on-zram was a fedora wiki. And I've seen it on my F33 system, so I thought it might be worth a shot to ask in here. :-D
Mar 24 13:21:47 <Khaytsus>	Hang out, cmurf might still have advice, but unless you can modify the config I'm not exactly sure what we could suggest, even you're not using the same setup at all.

Mar 24 19:47:43 <cmurf>	Khaytsus: *shrug* not sure about busybox. But sizing zram to 175% RAM for use as swap might be OK, but it's a bunch of tradeoffs if the setup is routinely overcomitting resources.

Mar 24 19:51:29 <cmurf>	like you'd want to check swap in/out and compare it to page faults, once memory is reduced holding onto compressed anonymous pages it's possible that reclaim goes up i.e. any pages backed by a file like a library or config or binary can just be dropped to free up memory because it can be read back in from the file later
Mar 24 19:51:47 <cmurf>	so that reading it back in can look a lot like swap thrashing if it gets bad
Mar 24 19:52:18 <cmurf>	you see that in cases with too little or no swap or with a severly reduced swappiness value
Mar 24 19:52:39 <cmurf>	so yeah anyway it depends
Mar 24 19:53:24 <Khaytsus>	Looks like that guy left :/  But yeah, he just looked like he had a zram question on his embedded system, not Fedora at all
Mar 24 19:53:49 <cmurf>	and it's gonna change because there's a bunch of kernel work that has happened lately on swap
Mar 24 19:54:30 <cmurf>	and there's a bunch more work planned for mm, zswap LRU stuff, and swap to make all three of them work better together rather than requiring a lot of tuning
Mar 24 19:55:16 <cmurf>	and still yet other work by google folks on reclaim
Mar 24 19:56:00 <cmurf>	there's a bunch of knobs for this but I think they want to make it all a bit smarter so it's self configuring for the most part
Mar 24 19:56:33 <cmurf>	here we go...
Mar 24 19:56:35 <cmurf>	https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210313075747.3781593-1-yuzhao@google.com/
Mar 24 19:59:03 <cmurf>	folks are probably better off increasing swappiness with SSDs/NVMe from 60 to 100, to reduce file page faulting in memory tight situations
Mar 24 20:01:53 <cmurf>	but i think folks should stick with the defaults until proven they're wrong and then we should either change them at the distro level or push to change them upstream
Mar 24 20:13:38 <Ilgaz>	weirdest thing ever, fedora 34 inside vmware player causes windows 10 GSOD :-) Saying as a heads up if anyone here has same setup

Mar 24 21:18:28 <cmurf>	what model wifi?
Mar 24 21:18:32 <cmurf>	is this Intel AX210?

Mar 24 21:24:02 <cmurf>	i wonder if it's xz compression related...
Mar 24 21:24:35 <cmurf>	I suggest searching for a bug in rhbz and if you don't find one, file one
Mar 24 21:24:40 <cmurf>	package is linux-firmware
Mar 24 21:28:25 <Han>	I tried unpacking one, that doesn't make a difference. I also tried the firmware directly from intel, to no avail.
Mar 24 21:28:43 <cmurf>	what kernel version?
Mar 24 21:29:17 <Han>	5.11.8-300.fc34.x86_64, and the same problem with 5.11.7-300.fc34.x86_64

Mar 24 21:36:27 <cmurf>	that's the upstream list for wireless bugs
Mar 24 21:36:31 <n3p>	Maybe that could help  >>>>>>> $ sudo depmod -a
Mar 24 21:38:04 <Han>	n3p, it was worth a shot.
Mar 24 21:38:26 <n3p>	cmurf, some kernel modules were not loading correctly with 5.11.6 and 5.11.7, you also need to rebuild initframs
Mar 24 21:38:38 <cmurf>	hmm
Mar 24 21:38:47 <cmurf>	that's not right
Mar 24 21:39:30 <n3p>	in my case kernel 5.11.8 is working fine
Mar 24 21:40:24 <cmurf>	5.11.8 and 5.12-rc4 for me, but it's 8260 model
Mar 24 21:40:35 <cmurf>	my initramfs does not have iwlwifi module in it
Mar 24 21:41:19 <Han>	I already did a dnf reinstall $(rpm -qa|grep '^kernel')
Mar 24 21:41:31 <cmurf>	weird that it was working and now isn't working
Mar 24 21:41:34 <cmurf>	i don't have an explanation for that
Mar 24 21:42:06 <cmurf>	i think you'll have to narrow it down, if it's some kind of race
Mar 24 21:42:11 <cmurf>	or if an older kernel will work
Mar 24 21:42:24 <n3p>	xz is to slow for kernel modules, specially for SSD, I suggest using zstd or no compression
Mar 24 21:42:25 <Han>	I'm afraid I didn't reboot for some time and uninstalled the working kernel.
Mar 24 21:42:48 <cmurf>	you can get them from koji
Mar 24 21:43:03 <cmurf>	https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=8
Mar 24 21:43:13 <cmurf>	make sure you get the correct arch

Mar 24 21:43:26 <germanceocom[m]>	<cmurf "germanceocom: you might use virs"> Thank you so much! I will try in a few minutes :)
Mar 24 21:43:28 <cmurf>	and download each of the packages that you already have installed
Mar 24 21:44:03 <cmurf>	kernel kernel-core kernel-modules, etc
Mar 24 21:44:37 <cmurf>	you can rpm -qa | grep kernel |sort  to see what subpackages you have, but strictly for testing you only need the above three
Mar 24 21:45:25 <cmurf>	sorry you have to fiddle with it but it's really process of elimination to find out what's going on
Mar 24 21:45:55 <cmurf>	and then probably file a bug, although you might do a better search than i did

Mar 24 22:03:43 <cmurf>	it's just that firmware blobs specifically don't have zstd support yet
Mar 24 22:03:59 <plowpath[m]>	does f34 clean installation with defaults do unified fs thing? boot was on ext4 before does it defaults now to brfs?
Mar 24 22:04:13 <cmurf>	no and no
Mar 24 22:04:23 <cmurf>	f34 layout is the same as f33
Mar 24 22:04:44 <cmurf>	and we wouldn't change that on release version upgrades anyway
Mar 24 22:04:44 <plowpath[m]>	thanks, i remember there was a change for that has that been moved to f35?
Mar 24 22:06:17 <cmurf>	there were three options in the f33 change proposal for btrfs by default but none of them happened :) it was enough to just do btrfs by default
Mar 24 22:06:25 <cmurf>	for f34, we do have compression by default
Mar 24 22:06:59 <cmurf>	i'm not sure  yet what will land for f35 or f36
Mar 24 22:06:59 <plowpath[m]>	👍
Mar 24 22:07:31 <cmurf>	i think my next focus is to document the unified grub change so folks stop stepping on /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg
Mar 24 22:07:57 <cmurf>	that will be a static "fowarding" grub.cfg only, the real one will be at /boot/grub2/grub.cfg same as BIOS
Mar 24 22:08:26 <cmurf>	and also document how to reuse a "home" subvolume when doing a clean install on Btrfs without reformatting
Mar 24 22:09:14 <cmurf>	instead of reformatting the old / you just create a new / which creates a new "rootX" subvolume
Mar 24 22:09:58 <cmurf>	the possibly confusing part is the UI shows this with "reformat" being checked, which might scare some folks into thinking the Btrfs volume will be reformatted, including their /home
Mar 24 22:10:20 <cmurf>	but it won't - if you click on all the mountpoints, it only shows / as being reformatted (slightly confusing so it should be documented)
Mar 24 22:10:48 <plowpath[m]>	<cmurf "and also document how to reuse a"> sounds very cool
Mar 24 22:11:02 <plowpath[m]>	to keep the /home and clean install rest
Mar 24 22:11:09 <cmurf>	yeah
Mar 24 22:11:41 <cmurf>	there is a testcase for this already
Mar 24 22:11:42 <cmurf>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Testcase_partitioning_custom_btrfs_preserve_home
Mar 24 22:11:53 <cmurf>	but it'd be nice to have a quickdoc instead
Mar 24 22:13:04 <cws>	plowpath[m]: What is with the repeating what other people have said in your messages?
Mar 24 22:13:15 <cws>	I see that around freenode, and its obnoxious.
Mar 24 22:13:30 <n3p>	cmurf yes quickdoc will be nice because a lot of us know too little about btrfs
Mar 24 22:13:59 <cmurf>	cws it's a matrix thing, you reply to a message for context, and the bridge does a partial copy/paste i guess
Mar 24 22:14:06 <cmurf>	same on discord
Mar 24 22:14:11 <plowpath[m]>	cws: oh guess its because I use the reply feature of matrix. sorry I forget about irc folks wont do that anymore
Mar 24 22:14:12 <cws>	Oh, ew.
Mar 24 22:14:43 <cmurf>	well eventually matrix will be primary once fedora has its own servers so...plenty to get used to
Mar 24 22:16:12 <cmurf>	oh yeah both our own homeserve and bridge - that'll help make the experience better

Mar 24 22:20:08 <cws>	dumb question incoming
Mar 24 22:20:17 <cws>	are fedora isos straight dd-able to usb, or do they require some writer?
Mar 24 22:20:36 <cmurf>	cat or dd
Mar 24 22:21:09 <cmurf>	(Fedora) Media Writer basically does cat
Mar 24 22:21:21 <cws>	Cool, thanks
Mar 24 22:21:35 <n3p>	cp also works for me
Mar 24 22:21:43 <cmurf>	haven't tried cp
Mar 24 22:21:46 <cws>	I generally go the cp route out of laziness
Mar 24 22:21:54 <cws>	all works equally well, really
Mar 24 22:21:54 <cmurf>	cp to a block device? that works?
Mar 24 22:22:05 <n3p>	yes
Mar 24 22:22:07 <cmurf>	learn something new everyday
Mar 24 22:22:44 <n3p>	cp -a  fedora.iso /dev/sdX (USB flash drive)
Mar 24 22:23:13 <cws>	I don't think you need -a, since its just doing a block copy.
Mar 24 22:23:56 <n3p>	cws, you're right
Mar 24 22:24:52 <_AnK>	Hello. Need a vcodec H.264 for ffmpeg streaming. Available one 'h264' hogs too much of my processor power. Do you know any other version of H.264 i can use? Thanks.
Mar 24 22:26:07 <n3p>	any video codec is CPU intensive
Mar 24 22:27:05 *	cws goes to reboot into kde live, see how well this goes
Mar 24 22:28:13 <n3p>	_AnK, try to downgrade size/frames and test
Mar 24 22:29:37 <_AnK>	Will do. Thanks. Thought perhaps there are better ones. Say i heard there is something called h264_videotoolbox. But i do not know in what package it is sitting?
Mar 24 22:30:28 *	thebacon[m] is now known as Popeyes[m]
Mar 24 22:32:30 *	tnewman7 is now known as tnewman
Mar 24 22:33:56 <germanceocom[m]>	<cmurf "germanceocom: you might use virs"> Seems to be as I originally wanted.   I have come so close and its just hit a full stop for me. No clue what to do
Mar 24 22:35:47 <cmurf[m]>	germanceocom: compare the xml
Mar 24 22:36:02 <n3p>	_AnK, vlc has video stemming, maybe you could test some codecs there
Mar 24 22:36:50 <_AnK>	Yes. Thanks.
Mar 24 22:37:07 <cmurf[m]>	Also google the error message
Mar 24 22:38:10 <pushqrdx>	can someone please help me get the bottom of this bizarre issue. So i am running nixOS/gnome and it's running smooth 60fps no stuttering or dropped frames, now same machine fedora rawhide which even has a more recent mesa stack 21 vs 20.2.4 on nix and gnome desktop is sloooow
Mar 24 22:38:23 <pushqrdx>	~30 fps and tons of stuttering
Mar 24 22:38:53 <pushqrdx>	there isn't a huge difference between running glxinfo on both systems, both seem to use i915 modesetting driver so what's wrong
Mar 24 22:38:53 <Han>	cmurf[m], didn't work. Oh well. :-(
Mar 24 22:39:03 <pushqrdx>	been trying to figure it out for a long time with no luck
Mar 24 22:39:13 <Han>	pushqrdx, check your dmesg
Mar 24 22:39:32 <pushqrdx>	Han for what?
Mar 24 22:39:55 <n3p>	_AnK, by the way. #videolan could be helpful. Ask there the same question
Mar 24 22:40:33 <cmurf[m]>	Han, what was the oldest kernel you tried?
Mar 24 22:40:48 <_AnK>	Oh Thanks a lot.
Mar 24 22:41:38 <_AnK>	join #videolan
Mar 24 22:41:41 <_AnK>	sorry
Mar 24 22:42:34 <cws>	Wow, this is actually really nice.
Mar 24 22:44:03 <cmurf[m]>	Han, try 5.11.9, even try 5.12-rc4. if they are all broken and there's no mention of it on the wireless lust and there's no bug report then... File a bug include dmesg and all the colonel versions you tested with and then post a summary on the wireless list. Upstream needs to know about this before it likely gets fixed in fedora.
Mar 24 22:44:39 <pushqrdx>	gonna reboot into fedora to see dmesg output
Mar 24 22:45:18 *	Popeyes[m] is now known as TacoJohns[m]
Mar 24 22:46:51 <Han>	cmurf[m], 5.11.5, and that didn't even properly boot.

Mar 26 23:08:34 <warren>	yeah curious when the health numbers are almost the same
Mar 26 23:10:05 *	gramestad is now known as Lomanotte
Mar 26 23:10:15 <warren>	I've had random good luck buying enterprise SSD's used. Two years ago bought a dozen 2GB's. Most of them arrived unopened/unused. One was accidentally 4TB.
Mar 26 23:10:24 <warren>	err 2TB's
Mar 26 23:10:41 <cmurf>	i guess you could try formatting them?
Mar 26 23:10:50 <cmurf>	the nvme format command i mean
Mar 26 23:11:20 <cmurf>	are both the reads and writes affected? or just writes?
Mar 26 23:12:02 <cmurf>	specs are 2800 M/s read, 1900 M/s write
Mar 26 23:14:02 <warren>	does nvme format do anything different from blkdiscard?
Mar 26 23:14:40 <warren>	cmurf: i need a better tool to measure performance, bonnie++ was messy. it seems both read and write were slower but I want to test it again
Mar 26 23:15:02 <warren>	zodbot thought I was giving karma to someone LOL
Mar 26 23:17:35 <cmurf>	nvme format will erase all cells, blkdiscard only erases cells with assigned LBAs
Mar 26 23:18:01 <cmurf>	due to the flash translation layer, possibly quite a lot aren't assigned at any given time
Mar 26 23:18:47 <warren>	ohh I'll give that a try
Mar 26 23:18:58 <cmurf>	i don't suppose it will make any difference
Mar 26 23:19:05 <cmurf>	but *shrug*
Mar 26 23:20:52 <warren>	# nvme format /dev/nvme1n1
Mar 26 23:20:52 <warren>	invalid lbaf:255
Mar 26 23:22:06 <cmurf>	https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli/issues/650
Mar 26 23:23:37 <warren>	I don't really understand what they're saying there but apparently --lbaf=0 is correct?
Mar 26 23:23:52 <cmurf>	so that might be a work around, but i think it means that your device probably needs
Mar 26 23:24:22 <cmurf>	nvme format /dev/nvme0 --namespace-id=1 --ses=1
Mar 26 23:24:32 <cmurf>	i don't know for sure if -ses=1 is needed
Mar 26 23:25:23 <cmurf>	the doc is confusing, it says for -s that erase does xyz, but does that only apply to Secure Erase? And is Secure Erase only --ses=1 or 2? or also 0?
Mar 26 23:26:03 <cmurf>	ok i guess 0 is no secure erase; but is 'erase' in the context of -s *any* of the options or just 1 or 2
Mar 26 23:26:09 <cmurf>	i would do both :P
Mar 26 23:26:11 <cmurf>	haha
Mar 26 23:26:35 <cmurf>	--ses=1 is probably what you want if supported but it's a 2014 nvme so quite an early example
Mar 26 23:26:47 <cmurf>	if it doesn't work then just omit it
Mar 26 23:29:03 *	denisse is now known as owo
Mar 26 23:29:22 <cmurf>	oh my, quite verbose information with 'sudo nvme id-ctrl -H /dev/nvme0n1'
Mar 26 23:29:33 *	owo is now known as Guest66114
Mar 26 23:29:40 *	Guest66114 is now known as denisse
Mar 26 23:30:48 *	denisse is now known as uwu
Mar 26 23:30:56 *	uwu is now known as group
Mar 26 23:31:00 *	group is now known as uwu
Mar 26 23:31:18 *	uwu is now known as Guest90092
Mar 26 23:32:15 <cmurf>	this is so much like secret decoder ring stuff
Mar 26 23:34:54 <cmurf>	and what the heck is --reset? it just says reset after successful format, ok? but what does reset do?
Mar 26 23:35:33 <cmurf>	you did successfully apply a newer firmware for both of them?
Mar 26 23:35:46 <warren>	yes it was easy with intel's cli tool
Mar 26 23:35:58 <cmurf>	interesting
Mar 26 23:37:13 <cmurf>	i don't know enough about what a namespace is, I think it's like a virtual device
Mar 26 23:37:24 <cmurf>	it's sorta like a partition but at the nvme level
Mar 26 23:37:25 <warren>	dd writing 1TB on both drives they're identical now
Mar 26 23:37:40 <cmurf>	i don't know how separated the namespacing is
Mar 26 23:37:48 <cmurf>	ha
Mar 26 23:37:59 <cmurf>	so was it the reformat or was it the firmware?
Mar 26 23:38:02 <cmurf>	or both?
Mar 26 23:38:20 <warren>	bonnie++ test was after the firmware upgrade, dd test was after the format
Mar 26 23:38:48 <cmurf>	ok which format command did you end up using?
Mar 26 23:38:54 <warren>	--lbaf=0
Mar 26 23:39:45 <warren>	the man page lies
Mar 26 23:40:32 <cmurf>	if you can believe it, things are alot better with the nvme command today than just a few years ago
Mar 26 23:40:50 <cmurf>	it's still pretty goofy compared to smartctl or hdparm
Mar 26 23:40:59 <warren>	I can see that
Mar 26 23:41:00 <cmurf>	but even hdparm has its own strange ways
Mar 26 23:41:15 <cmurf>	like -W controls the write cache and -w will blow up the drive
Mar 26 23:41:17 <warren>	I'll be back in a few hours, another workload test should be done by then.
Mar 26 23:41:23 <warren>	LOL
Mar 26 23:41:45 <cmurf>	seriously, worth doing a man search on hdparm for the word DANGEROUS
Mar 26 23:41:55 <linuxmodder>	is this nvme disk level encrypting / erasing ( with seds )?
Mar 26 23:41:56 <cmurf>	almost like there are fewer non-danger commands
Mar 26 23:42:07 <cmurf>	2014 probably not
Mar 26 23:42:19 <cmurf>	the other command i gave reveals that
Mar 26 23:42:52 <cmurf>	nvme id-ctrl -H /dev/nvme0n1 | grep-i  'crypt\|sanit'
Mar 26 23:44:51 <cmurf>	its functionally like ATA Security Erase (using hdparm) for a SATA SSD
Mar 26 23:45:14 <kk4ewt>	i use scrub -fp dod on everything
Mar 26 23:45:50 <linuxmodder>	^^
Mar 26 23:46:08 <linuxmodder>	or for those things that matter too much .... dod long
Mar 26 23:46:22 <kk4ewt>	good enough for the DoD good enough for me
Mar 26 23:46:48 <cmurf>	NIST 800-88 actually doesn't recommend that
Mar 26 23:47:03 <kk4ewt>	and i have had drives checked by the DOD and they said they were good
Mar 26 23:47:42 <cmurf>	for old drives that didn't have sector remapping, probably worked
Mar 26 23:48:10 <kk4ewt>	works great because it makes a file and builds and wipes the f
Mar 26 23:48:12 <kk4ewt>	ile
Mar 26 23:48:30 <cmurf>	yeah but that only wipes sectors that have LBAs
Mar 26 23:48:43 <kk4ewt>	wipes ssd fine
Mar 26 23:49:00 <cmurf>	it definitely doesn't work on SSDs
Mar 26 23:49:19 <cmurf>	anywhere from 1% to 20% of the sectors/cells on an SSD have no LBA
Mar 26 23:49:25 <cmurf>	and it's constantly changing
Mar 26 23:49:26 <kk4ewt>	of course the whole thing about phantomly being able to ready a drive has been debunked
Mar 26 23:49:47 <kk4ewt>	so all 0s or 1s is fine

Mar 30 21:30:06 <billings>	would Fedora consider broken man pages a blocker?
Mar 30 21:35:29 <dowdle>	billings: As in all man pages or just some?
Mar 30 21:35:42 <billings>	'man gnome-shell' and 'man gnome-extensions'
Mar 30 21:35:46 <dowdle>	billings: man pages are broken?
Mar 30 21:35:57 <dowdle>	billings: On F34 Beta?
Mar 30 21:35:58 <billings>	yes
Mar 30 21:36:00 <billings>	Filed a bug
Mar 30 21:36:20 <billings>	I set priority to low because I wasn't sure if it is a blocker (who reads the manuals?)
Mar 30 21:37:26 <billings>	technically, it's a bug caused by GNOME bundling a bad file in the tarball
Mar 30 21:39:33 <dowdle>	billings: Oh, and like.. .I have to boot F34 WORKSTATION, eh?
Mar 30 21:39:42 <billings>	?
Mar 30 21:42:35 <dowdle>	billings: I can't duplicate the bug on F34 XFCE. :)
Mar 30 21:42:42 <cmurf>	billings: best to mention the bug on #fedora-workstation
Mar 30 21:43:03 <billings>	it appears to be a bad package in GNOME
Mar 30 21:43:09 <billings>	but OK
Mar 30 21:44:12 <cmurf>	maintainer for fedora is in that channel but in his timezone it's end of the day, maybe he'll see the message tomorrow

Apr 01 22:12:58 <truexfan81>	my father is trying to install skypeforlinux on his fedora 33 machine and is running into dependency problems, can this be fixed?
Apr 01 22:13:17 <truexfan81>	https://go.skype.com/skypeforlinux-64.rpm
Apr 01 22:13:46 <janos_>	how is he installing that rpm?
Apr 01 22:14:12 <truexfan81>	sudo dnf install https://go.skype.com/skypeforlinux-64.rpm
Apr 01 22:14:54 <janos_>	hrm, that should resolve the deps if the deps can be found
Apr 01 22:15:12 <janos_>	what's the actual error?
Apr 01 22:15:16 <truexfan81>	and some of them can't be found which is the problem
Apr 01 22:17:10 <janos_>	you may want to go the flatpak route if skype hasn't packaged it up in a working fashion for fedora
Apr 01 22:17:12 <truexfan81>	i just told him how to pipe it into fpaste, i'll give you the link when he gets it to me
Apr 01 22:17:26 <janos_>	https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.skype.Client
Apr 01 22:17:28 <janos_>	ok
Apr 01 22:18:07 <janos_>	i just tried - it appears to want something named 'libatomic1'. i'm pretty sure it's 'libatomic'
Apr 01 22:18:32 <truexfan81>	yeah thats the one
Apr 01 22:18:42 <janos_>	you may be able to do this:
Apr 01 22:18:47 <janos_>	sudo dnf install libatomic
Apr 01 22:19:04 <janos_>	(note not libatomic1. that sounds like a mistake for fedora)
Apr 01 22:19:23 <truexfan81>	oh we installed that already
Apr 01 22:19:29 <coppice_>	that skype update uses a version of libatomic that hasn't made it into a fedora RPM yet
Apr 01 22:19:42 <janos_>	and then add --skip-broken to the dnf install https://go.skype.com/skypeforlinux-64.rpm
Apr 01 22:19:53 <janos_>	but i would personally go the flatpak route
Apr 01 22:21:00 <janos_>	it's quite possible that rpm simply won't work until Ms fixes the reference
Apr 01 22:22:43 <truexfan81>	alright thank you
Apr 01 22:24:36 <truexfan81>	interesting
Apr 01 22:24:40 <truexfan81>	now when he tells dnf to install it it's telling him "command not found"

Apr 07 15:30:05 <ledeni>	Psi-Jack: if you have rpmfusion repos you can try to install 'pulseaudio-module-bluetooth-freeworld' it's includes support for LDAC, aptX, aptX-HD and AAC codecs.
Apr 07 15:30:23 <Psi-Jack>	That actually conflicts on 34B with pipewire pulse.
Apr 07 15:38:30 <Khaytsus>	He doesn't need any of that
Apr 07 15:38:41 <Khaytsus>	AAC _just_ _works_
Apr 07 15:39:07 <Khaytsus>	AptX....  yes, rpmfusion.  And no idea about conflicts offhand, but AptX will likely not be in Fedora any time soon.
Apr 07 15:39:42 <Khaytsus>	My test laptop here is bone stock Fedora, zero done to it, installed and updated.  LDAC and AAC just work.
Apr 07 15:43:11 <gnafu>	I imagine RPM Fusion will need to update some of its packaging to account for PipeWire vs. PulseAudio when it comes to aptX, but that's just a guess.  34's not released yet, so I don't expect RPM Fusion to have it all figured out.
Apr 07 15:45:29 <Khaytsus>	Yep, their adaption rate to a new release varies.  Sometimes lines up, sometimes lags
Apr 07 15:46:29 <gnafu>	And the PipeWire change is sufficiently big that I wouldn't be surprised if there are some early hiccups.
Apr 07 15:47:52 <coppice>	pipewire is working well for me with F33. I'm only using the pulseaudio emulation. I haven't tried the jack emulation
Apr 07 15:48:01 <Khaytsus>	I am beginning to wonder though..  my old laptop here has _always_ had a weird bug where the radios go _hard_ blocked until you yank power/battery.
Apr 07 15:48:26 <Khaytsus>	but I've seen it multiple times here recently.... and have seen other people say they're seeing rf block's in 34B.  Maybe coincidence.
Apr 07 15:48:58 <Khaytsus>	I recall seeing it a few times when I was using it full time, but seldom enough to always have to figure out what the issue is ;)
Apr 07 15:53:35 <ledeni>	Psi-Jack: you can pass conflict add --allowerasing
Apr 07 15:54:54 <Khaytsus>	I still say he has zero reason to, AAC and LDAC just work.
Apr 07 15:55:35 <dowdle>	gnafu: rpmfusion has been building F34 stuff since it branched from rawhide and also has rawhide packages.
Apr 07 15:57:38 <gnafu>	dowdle: Building, yes, but I'm just saying I would understand if there were packaging decisions that might need to change.
Apr 07 15:58:25 <gnafu>	dowdle: Like, some new pipewire-*-freeworld for one thing or another where a pulseaudio-*-freeworld package used to work.  I don't know that there will be things like that, but I would understand if there were and they weren't ready yet :-).
Apr 07 16:00:16 <dowdle>	gnafu: I'm just guessing here, but generally speaking... the add support for additional codecs to augment the codecs that are already there... I don't think they need to change underlying audio driver stuff for that.
Apr 07 16:00:23 <dowdle>	the add = they add
Apr 07 16:01:02 <dowdle>	But that's for the packages they provide as alternatives to the Fedora versions.  For stuff Fedora doesn't package, different deal.
Apr 07 16:03:17 <dowdle>	gnafu: I've been using F34 on one system for a while now and using plenty of rpmfusion stuff without any issues... but I'm not an advance audio system user.
Apr 07 16:03:20 <gnafu>	dowdle: Yeah.  I don't know that a specific *freeworld package will be needed; it might already be covered by some gstreamer* package or something.
Apr 07 16:03:30 <dowdle>	 (doing mostly media consumption and little creation)
Apr 07 16:04:23 <dowdle>	I actually upgraded from F33 to F34 on one system at home this morning... and plan on doing my work workstation in a couple of hours.
Apr 07 16:05:03 <dowdle>	gnafu: In #rpmfusion... here's what someone said...
Apr 07 16:05:08 <dowdle>	[09:04] <FranciscoD> dowdle: "This proposal is to replace the PulseAudio daemon with a functionally compatible implementation based on PipeWire. This means that all existing clients using the PulseAudio client library will continue to work as before, as well as applications shipped as Flatpak."
Apr 07 16:05:21 *	FranciscoD is here too
Apr 07 16:05:24 <FranciscoD>	https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DefaultPipeWire
Apr 07 16:05:28 <dowdle>	FranciscoD: Of course you are.
Apr 07 16:05:30 <FranciscoD>	I quoted the change page, which is ^
Apr 07 16:06:00 <FranciscoD>	Also a dedicated section: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/DefaultPipeWire#Upgrade.2Fcompatibility_impact
Apr 07 16:06:59 <gnafu>	FranciscoD: Do you know if there's already a "correct" or "best" way to get aptX support with Bluetooth when using the new PipeWire setup?
Apr 07 16:07:18 <FranciscoD>	no, sorry---best to ask the pipewire folks I'd think
Apr 07 16:07:52 <Khaytsus>	I'd think rpmfusion folks, but..  Not sure how folks collaborate on things like that
Apr 07 16:08:11 <FranciscoD>	you can stay on PA until all features are ported to pipewire I guess: `$ sudo dnf swap --allowerasing pipewire-pulseaudio pulseaudio
Apr 07 16:08:13 <FranciscoD>	`
Apr 07 16:09:05 <FranciscoD>	there's a #pipewire apparently
Apr 07 16:09:08 <gnafu>	I don't think I have any Bluetooth devices that use aptX, so I guess I won't worry about it for now :-).
Apr 07 16:09:44 <gnafu>	Sorry to take us down a path that's not quite appropriate for this channel.  I understand this is constantly evolving thing right now.
Apr 07 16:09:55 <Khaytsus>	Honestly....  AAC and AptX are _pretty_ similar in audio quality..  and I've yet to see a headset that does AptX but not AAC, almost all aren't just SBC garbage at least do AAC

Apr 07 16:12:05 <dowdle>	gnafu: a post from #rpmfusion
Apr 07 16:12:08 <dowdle>	[09:10] <kwizart> dowdle, indeed, the only wip issue is about a replacement for the previous pulseaudio-bluetooth-freeworld plugin for wireless headset using "non-free" codecs
Apr 07 16:12:46 *	dowdle continues to use wires for most everything.
Apr 07 16:12:48 <gnafu>	Khaytsus: Aah, good to know.  I'm definitely out of the loop on Bluetooth codecs.  I just wish Opus was a standard codec for it :-P.
Apr 07 16:13:10 <gnafu>	dowdle: Thanks :-).
Apr 07 16:13:20 <Khaytsus>	Opus is okay for very low bitrate to be "good enough" but otherwise, no. heh
Apr 07 16:13:24 <gnafu>	dowdle: I, too, use wired for as much as possible.
Apr 07 16:13:46 <Khaytsus>	But yeah, I would not buy _anything_ bluetooth for music or media that isn't at least AAc.  If it just AAC it better be cheap.
Apr 07 16:14:01 <gnafu>	Khaytsus: Opus is largely transparent for music once you start getting into the 96-128 kbps range.  It's definitely better than AAC.
Apr 07 16:14:10 <Psi-Jack>	dowdle, Oh! BTW, thank you for that specific observation yesterday! It was literally the gnome-shell theme specifically that was making the dash virtual desktop pager too small.
Apr 07 16:14:10 <Khaytsus>	SBC sounds awful.  It can sound _okay_ but very few devices or headsets support higher bitrate SBC.
Apr 07 16:15:20 <Khaytsus>	gnafu: I've only ever seen evidence that Opus is "useful" for anything except low bitrate stuff.  ie:  anything higher bitrate there are better options.  (ignoring OSS)
Apr 07 16:15:20 <dowdle>	Psi-Jack: Glad you got it figured out.
Apr 07 16:15:43 <Psi-Jack>	Yeah, sometimes the simplest issues are overlooked.
Apr 07 16:16:08 <coppice>	Audio on bluetooth is a bloody mess
Apr 07 16:16:17 <Khaytsus>	gnafu: But yeah, I don't see BT adding Opus as a codec.
Apr 07 16:16:21 <gnafu>	Khaytsus: Huh, that's not what I've taken from the listening tests I've seen.
Apr 07 16:16:39 <gnafu>	(And I use it at ~96 kbps for all the music on my phone.)
Apr 07 16:17:10 <Khaytsus>	gnafu: It's good for minimum size/acceptable bitrate..  but not really that useful for high quality music (again, compared to other options)
Apr 07 16:17:12 <music>	(You know, there are disadvantages to having a common word as a username…)
Apr 07 16:17:15 <dowdle>	gnafu: I know a few bitrate snobs who would claim with that bitrate it is akin to static. :)  I'm usually fairly happy with 128k.
Apr 07 16:17:23 <coppice>	for all the codecs they've been bribed to throw into the bluetooth spec, they still have no way to do bidirectional high quality audio
Apr 07 16:18:00 <Khaytsus>	coppice: Actually HSP can do high bitrate, but hardly ANY devices support it.
Apr 07 16:18:10 <Khaytsus>	So yeah, HSP/HFP sounds _terrible_ on bluetooth in almost every case.
Apr 07 16:18:39 <Khaytsus>	which is why I gave up it and went with a wireless "gaming" Headset (which uses proprietary wifi stuff)
Apr 07 16:19:40 <gnafu>	dowdle: That's why double-blind testing is important, and it means a lot more to me than claims and opinions :-).
Apr 07 16:19:49 <coppice>	Khaytsus: HSP allows high quality to the headphones, but poor quality from the mic
Apr 07 16:20:21 <Khaytsus>	coppice: Hmm, I thought it was higher bitrate on both ends (as compared to HFP etc) but I could have mis-read
Apr 07 16:21:31 <Khaytsus>	I'm not an audiophool but I won't listen to low quality music or SBC bluetooth...  all the artifacts and distortion ,ugghhhhh...  I can put up with low quality headphones for certain cases (like...  mowing.. heh)
Apr 07 16:22:06 <Khaytsus>	My ancient music collection I can always hear the low bitrate junk..  Drives me crazy.
Apr 07 16:22:57 <coppice>	The biggest hit to listening quality with bluetooth it that AAC is about the only time you can hear the low bit rate source directly. Most times you are listening to extra decode and recode steps. 128k is not too bad. 128k -> linear ->128k can sound awful
Apr 07 16:25:19 <Khaytsus>	Well, yeah if you're using SBC all your music sounds the same ;)
Apr 07 16:27:11 <gnafu>	I rip all my CDs to FLAC and Opus@96k.  I listen to the FLAC versions on my home stereo, and I listen to the Opus versions on my phone and laptop.  I've yet to hear any artifacts during normal listening, whereas I definitely heard the occasional artifact with 128+k Vorbis in the past.
Apr 07 16:27:47 <Khaytsus>	I _really_ should keep all my flacs, I''m really bad about just keeping the lame extreme mp3's so I don't have to keep two sets of music (one for the pc, one for the phone)
Apr 07 16:27:49 <gnafu>	Opus has achieved something really special, and it's done it in a broadly-adopted royalty-free way.  I just want to see it in more places.
Apr 07 16:30:13 <Khaytsus>	Agreed, but even https://opus-codec.org/comparison/ only concentrates on low bitrate stuff.  :/
Apr 07 16:32:24 <gnafu>	With modern codecs, you really shouldn't need higher than ~64k/channel for a playback format.  For recording, mixing, etc.: sure.  For casual listening, anything more is overkill with Opus or a good AAC encoder.
Apr 07 16:32:41 <gnafu>	At LDAC's bitrates, you could nearly do FLAC :-P.
Apr 07 16:34:11 <Khaytsus>	Yeah I wish I had a sane way to manage a parallel library of mp3/flac but ...   and then late rwhen I really want to, well, the flacs aren't there. heh
Apr 07 16:38:14 <gnafu>	I recently reripped my CD collection using cyanrip, which has the option of encoding to FLAC and Opus simultaneously :-).
Apr 07 16:38:39 <Khaytsus>	Yeah, that's not too big a deal.. it's mostly tagging and keeping them.... in sync
Apr 07 16:38:53 <Khaytsus>	I guess you just do it all at once and if you're starting fresh, fine
Apr 07 16:40:15 <Khaytsus>	I re-ripped my CDs some years ago and while todays lame is likely better.... it's fine.  I don't even have an optical drive anywhere except my old laptop
Apr 07 16:40:22 <gnafu>	It was satisfying going through and updating/adding the appropriate releases in MusicBrainz, and then cyanrip just brings it all in.
Apr 07 16:46:54 <Khaytsus>	Most music I've purchased over the last few years has been 320 bitrate mp3, I've not seen any flacs for some reason.  Size I suppose.
Apr 07 16:50:29 <nrb>	hey, is there a changelog for kernel changes to fedora33?
Apr 07 16:50:45 <nrb>	i'm in search of a changelog for kerrnel specific changes within fedora 33, such as config changes
Apr 07 16:53:26 <Khaytsus>	nrb: https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-ark is the place, but....  not sure about a suggested method ;)
Apr 07 16:54:00 <Khaytsus>	Actually.. hmm..  not sure config is there, may just be at the srpm.
Apr 07 16:54:42 <nrb>	i don't necessarily look for the source itself
Apr 07 16:54:54 <nrb>	i need a changelog such as + added this - removed this
Apr 07 16:55:06 <Khaytsus>	rpm -q --changelog kernel
Apr 07 16:55:19 <Khaytsus>	but it's not going to contain real specific stuff
Apr 07 16:56:22 <nrb>	i am looking for stuff such as userfault
Apr 07 16:56:33 <nrb>	why it doesn't work as an unprivileged user anymore, and from which version it happens
Apr 07 16:57:01 <nrb>	this is what i hoped for in a changelog, so i can see a reference to a discussion board or something why something is gone or introduced
Apr 07 17:00:02 <Southern_Gentlem>	why do you think it was at the kernel level
Apr 07 17:00:20 <Southern_Gentlem>	it can be systemd, udev etc
Apr 07 17:00:25 <nrb>	" Set unprivileged_userfaultfd sysctl knob to 1 if kernel faults must be handled without obtaining CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability"
Apr 07 17:00:50 <nrb>	yeah i don't deny that, i just wonder why
Apr 07 17:01:03 <Southern_Gentlem>	nrb ok #fedora-kernel can answer your questions
Apr 07 17:01:20 <nrb>	ok
Apr 07 17:04:20 <dowdle>	nrb: You are also looking at mainline kernel change docs right?  I wouldn't imagine Fedora makes a whole lot of changes to mainline...
Apr 07 17:05:35 <nrb>	oh okay, didn't know it's mainline
Apr 07 17:06:36 <Khaytsus>	Of course Fedora uses the mainline kernel + config, likely some minor patches

Apr 07 18:58:09 <wwalker>	is there a way, during the install from the live image, to change the name of the VG?  instead of `fedora_localhost` I'd prefer `my-chrome-box` (anything unique, but the short hostname would be great)?
Apr 07 19:02:00 <Khaytsus>	wwalker: Yeah, in the disk setup screen click the auto setup bit, then on the right side edit the name
Apr 07 19:02:09 <Khaytsus>	Sorry I _always_ zone out on that screen and always forget the specifics.
Apr 07 19:02:22 <Khaytsus>	If that isn't helping I can fire up a VM an dlook
Apr 07 19:04:56 <Khaytsus>	Click the disk on the main screen for installation destination, click custom on that next screen, hit done, click "create them automatically" at the top, thenon the right side you cah click "Modify" under the Volume group

Apr 07 19:46:00 <rudrab>	is there any way to arrange apps alphabetically in gnome 40?
Apr 07 19:46:30 <rudrab>	or drag and drop is the only way?
Apr 07 19:48:48 <Khaytsus>	gsettings reset org.gnome.shell app-picker-layout             according to the internet
Apr 07 19:49:39 <rudrab>	@khaytsus: that was working on 3.38
Apr 07 19:49:42 <rudrab>	not on 40
Apr 07 19:50:14 <Khaytsus>	Bummer.
Apr 07 19:51:18 <rudrab>	anybody has any idea why gnome dev thought that random arrangement is the best thing?
Apr 07 19:51:30 <Khaytsus>	No, ask them.

Apr 07 20:32:10 <dez90ed>	Hello, I have a hp specter x360 15 "under fedora and I have no sound on the speaker, I had the same problem under debian. However under windows it works without problem. How to do? Thank you
Apr 07 20:33:33 <dez90ed>	https://paste.centos.org/view/96361caf
Apr 07 20:43:28 <gnafu>	dez90ed: Can you do a paste of 'uname -a'?
Apr 07 20:44:00 <dez90ed>	https://paste.centos.org/view/8644ada5
Apr 07 20:44:01 <gnafu>	Or I guess just 'uname -r' would suffice.
Apr 07 20:44:18 <gnafu>	Thanks.
Apr 07 20:48:01 <gnafu>	dez90ed: Are you able to see the audio device and it just doesn't play anything, or are you not even able to see it in your sound settings?
Apr 07 20:48:31 <gnafu>	dez90ed: Also, I think you need the alsa-sof-firmware (which I thought was installed by default), so you'll want to make sure that's installed.
Apr 07 20:51:36 <dez90ed>	gnafu, I see the bars moved but no sound but there is the audio device but I'm not sure that it detects the correct model (bang & olufsen)
Apr 07 20:52:13 <dez90ed>	how can I do?
Apr 07 20:52:55 <dez90ed>	gnafu, The alsa-sof-firmware-1.6.1-4.fc33.noarch package is already installed.
Apr 07 20:54:00 <gnafu>	Hmm, I'm not sure.  I'm not super familiar with the newer chipsets.
Apr 07 20:54:19 <gnafu>	Hopefully someone else can chime in :-).
Apr 07 20:54:48 <gnafu>	I don't know if there's anything you'd need to do on the NVIDIA side of things if there's some kind of tie between them.
Apr 07 20:55:39 <dez90ed>	gnafu, I don't know ... I don't know too much, it's been a year since I have the pc, it still doesn't work
Apr 07 20:56:11 <dowdle>	dez90ed: In the PulseAudio Volume Control... go to the Configuration tab and make sure the correct device is there.  If you are using HDMI, sometimes the system will make HDMI the default audio out.
Apr 07 20:58:47 <dez90ed>	dowdle, https://ibb.co/yyvnfzd
Apr 07 21:00:20 <dowdle>	dez90ed: What program is that a screenshot of?
Apr 07 21:00:45 <dez90ed>	preference in fedora gnome
Apr 07 21:02:09 <dowdle>	dez90ed: I'd recommend the pulseaudio volume control over that... although I can't guarantee it will resolve your issue.  Run the pavucontrol command.  If you don't have that, install the pavucontrol package with your package manager.
Apr 07 21:06:48 <dez90ed>	dowdle, https://ibb.co/L5mWBZ2
Apr 07 21:06:54 <dez90ed>	no sound
Apr 07 21:08:30 <dowdle>	dez90ed: Increase the width of that window so you can see all of the tabs and click on the last tab on the right.  In English, it is "Configuration".
Apr 07 21:09:01 <dez90ed>	dowdle, I think this is the wrong driver
Apr 07 21:10:15 <dez90ed>	dowdle, https://ibb.co/fGx6Mxd
Apr 07 21:11:08 <dowdle>	dez90ed: Ok, of those three, which one are you hooked up to (via speakers, headphones, etc)?
