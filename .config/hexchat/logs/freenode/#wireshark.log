Jun 28 14:32:27 <teto>	any good tutorial on how to use from the gui the lua Evalute console/Evaluate. There are some oddities there, like by default "Enter" closes the Evaluate window. I evaluate "print("hello")" but it does nothing except showing "evaluated". Also the translation in my language looks off but that's another issue xD
Jun 28 14:33:16 <teto>	I never looked at the lua component but I have a few ideas to launch some of my own programs from wireshark. looks interesting
Jun 28 14:35:43 <teto>	is there way to reload the plugins from the GUI ?

Oct 11 22:56:16 <TMM>	Hi all, I'm working on reverse engineering a usb protocol. How it works now is that I have a Windows VM with a passed through USB device with wireshark in the guest. Is it possible to passively read all of the data going over the usb bus from the host as well? I'm writing a sort of 'proof tool' that currently replays the pcap file and I see if I see what I expect.
Oct 11 22:56:30 <TMM>	However, without the exact data being read from the sensors while running I can't actually be entirely sure
Oct 11 22:57:08 <TMM>	so I'd like to be able basically run my validation tool on the host entirely passively (just checking if the values I would've sent match what the windows vm sends)
Oct 11 22:57:22 <TMM>	and so I can validate that I see the same values in the windows app as I see on my passive tool
Oct 11 23:07:18 <maslen>	I'm not an expert, but if it's  a passed through USB, wouldn't the guest be able to see all traffic?
Oct 11 23:07:24 <maslen>	the wireshark running on the guest * ?
Oct 11 23:07:39 <maslen>	Alternative option though is to also run wireshark on the host
Oct 11 23:12:28 <maslen>	host will always see everything

Oct 12 15:45:21 <tkk>	Hi. I'm running Wireshark 2.6.7, so I apologize if this has already been implemented in a newer version, but is there any way to extract http objects and view an http stream for a decrypted http2 session, like you would with plain http?
Oct 12 16:19:54 <TMM>	Lekensteyn ok, I guess whether or not I can sniff usb traffic on a passed through host device isn't really a wireshark question :)

Oct 20 23:05:40 *	Received a CTCP VERSION from freenode-connect
Oct 21 01:17:50 <nmz787>	hi, I'm figuring out a protocol of a piece of lab equipment that communicates over ethernet... I've got things setup to capture using a machine-in-the-middle with a ethernet cable reverser... now I'm trying to figure out how to filter the data properly to start analyzing
Oct 21 01:18:34 <nmz787>	I figured out a few things in wireshark filtering on the ip.src and scrolling through the packet list based on some notes I took (i.e. I clicked a command and noted what packet # was displayed in tshark at the time)
Oct 21 01:18:47 <nmz787>	so I have been able to localize a few packets that contain some commands
Oct 21 01:19:11 <nmz787>	they always show up in the byte pane as blue text, which I seem to have determined is user-data, versus protocol-level data
Oct 21 01:20:34 <nmz787>	but when I try to dump the data on the command line, I'm getting a bunch of empty packets, and when I try to print the data as text, I get an error
Oct 21 01:20:42 <nmz787>	tshark -r fib_startup.pcap -T fields -e frame.number -e data -R "data" -2 -R "ip.src==128.0.1.2"
Oct 21 01:20:52 <nmz787>	shows empty frames, and also frames with hex data
Oct 21 01:20:59 <nmz787>	tshark -r fib_startup.pcap -T fields -e frame.number -e data -R "data" -2 -R "ip.src==128.0.1.2" -x
Oct 21 01:21:07 <nmz787>	yields: "tshark: Raw packet hex data can only be printed as text, PostScript, JSON, JSONRAW or EK JSON"
Oct 21 01:22:30 <nmz787>	so I wonder how to eliminate the empty packets (I thought -R was supposed to do that)
Oct 21 01:22:44 <nmz787>	and even if I specify -T text, I still can't get the text to print on screen
Oct 21 01:22:56 <nmz787>	"tshark: Output fields were specified with "-e", but "-Tek, -Tfields, -Tjson or -Tpdml" was not specified."

Feb 28 22:47:47 <agentxcell>	I have a weird question. Is there any way to identify a certain piece of harware via TCP? We want to allow only connections from thin clients so I am trying to figure out if I can finger print packets coming from the thin clients?
Feb 28 22:48:27 <d0rm0us3>	mac adde's?
Feb 28 22:49:15 <agentxcell>	we would be filtering way to many, it isn't really an option
Feb 28 22:49:16 <d0rm0us3>	I presume you already have a inventory/system updating mechanism in place...
Feb 28 22:50:49 <agentxcell>	for reference, we are an msp, the client has many employees that work from home 70+ so the macs would be from their home network, correct?
Feb 28 22:52:27 <d0rm0us3>	yes
Feb 28 22:58:14 <agentxcell>	That seems like nightmare fuel. Hence why we were trying to figure out if there was something unique that we could fingerprint packets off of based on whether it was a thin client or not. It does update a registry key when loggin onto the server so we could right a script at log on that checks for that key and boots them if it is not there but we wanted to deny the connection before it go to that point
Feb 28 22:58:15 <agentxcell>	versus after they are logged on. Negligible but it seems the script might be the best option if there is no clear way to fingerprint the devices.
Feb 28 23:00:35 *	d0rm0us3 shrugs
Feb 28 23:30:34 <d0rm0us3>	hmmm... sounds more like an app on a cell phone...

Mar 18 16:43:09 <kebaby>	Hey, I'm trying to capture DNS packets over wifi from my phone to my wifi AP by using a network adapter I have in monitor mode. I've been able to get all the EAPOL handshake messages but I haven't seen any DNS packets. Googled some but I've no idea how to continue.
Mar 18 17:23:18 <maslen>	Are you using any sort of encryption for your wifi ?

Apr 02 10:01:32 <tpreston>	maslen: it runs correctly without -w. If I add -V, I can see that my display filter has worked as well.
Apr 02 10:01:51 <tpreston>	maslen: I also tried `-w - > /out.pcapng`, but I got the same error
Apr 02 10:44:58 <tpreston>	Which suggests a problem with the -w internals. I suspect it has an upper limit on the size? Perhaps a wireshark dev can point me in the right direction?

Apr 03 23:34:51 <rofail>	does anyone know an article about this subject where i can get started??

Apr 12 02:47:11 <artyx>	Fair disclosure, i'm doing some sort of "home work " assignment, so maybe other than yes or no, please do not engage spoilers.   I have this packet dump, that I have looked at, and when I "follow TCP stream" .. I get what looks like a http session.  RIGHT smack in the middle of the session, in two seperate places, are two odd sequences. they look like it could be a glitch in parsing/reassembling packets, but its something like function("error
Apr 12 02:48:35 <artyx>	^M is actually a CRLF (in the output, the hex value is just sort of floating in nothingness....) could this be some sort of render glitch in the application itself? or is this a sign of a more serious circumstance.  I can provide a SS of anonymized copy if you are not sure what i am referring to
Apr 12 02:50:59 <artyx>	its weird, maybe its a product of how the data itself was generated originally, and a sloppy question, .. but i'm not certain of this.  these values do not magically concide with packet address/sequence numbers

Apr 23 22:47:30 <Guest8617>	Lekensteyn, the version in debian stable or at all?
Apr 23 22:47:39 <Lekensteyn>	consider using either ssh-dumpcap or ssh-tcpdump from https://git.lekensteyn.nl/peter/wireshark-notes/tree/extcap
Apr 23 22:47:43 <Lekensteyn>	at all
Apr 23 22:47:57 <Lekensteyn>	it links directly with libssh which does not implement the OpenSSH agent AFAIK
Apr 23 22:48:45 <Guest8617>	is that being worked on at all or plans to?
Apr 23 22:49:14 <Lekensteyn>	not worked on, maybe if libssh (not to be confused with libssh2) supports it, it could be added
Apr 23 22:51:40 <Lekensteyn>	looks like it is potentially possible to add agent support
Apr 23 22:56:34 <Lekensteyn>	Guest8617: ssh-agent appears to be supported, I did not have to configure anything special. Using Arch Linux
Apr 23 22:56:45 <Lekensteyn>	what debian version are you using with what wireshark and libssh version?
Apr 23 22:57:15 <Lekensteyn>	agent support must have been present in at least 2010
Apr 23 22:58:57 <Guest8617>	Version 2.6.8 (Git v2.6.8 packaged as 2.6.8-1.1
Apr 23 22:59:32 <Lekensteyn>	it should work
Apr 23 22:59:34 <Guest8617>	Devuan Beowulf
Apr 23 23:01:40 <Guest8617>	ok, so I got ssh-tcpdump extcap working
Apr 23 23:02:15 <Guest8617>	but how do I supply extra settings that way, like filtering out my localip address so my ssh session isn't feeding back into the capture and not enable promiscuous mode
Apr 23 23:03:35 <Guest8617>	or enable ssh compression
Apr 23 23:06:12 <Guest8617>	nevermind
Apr 23 23:06:13 <Guest8617>	I see
Apr 23 23:06:41 <Guest8617>	It's really simple script i can modify. nice I didn't know wireshark was extendable like that. Thanks! =3
Apr 23 23:11:12 <Guest8617>	In the source filter is it possible to only show ip.src_addr (ipv6 cidr range) ?
Apr 23 23:11:17 <Guest8617>	or am i wasting my time
Apr 23 23:11:29 <Guest8617>	for example show all matches that are in the range instead of a single address
Apr 23 23:15:02 <Guest8617>	oh yes i see bug 5538 solves this
Apr 24 07:55:52 <edmont>	hi

Oct 17 00:20:21 <sarbes>	Hi there! I'm trying to write a Profibus (LINKTYPE_PROFIBUS_DL) dissector, but I'm struggling to create the handle. I'm unsure what to put in as protocol when associating the handle.
Oct 17 00:28:34 <sarbes>	So far, I can inspect the bus in Sigrok via a custom RS485 adapter. From there, I've written a basic Python decoder which does some basic checks and dumps the packets as a pcap file.
Oct 17 00:32:24 <sarbes>	The tutorials for C/Lua dissectors seem to be based on already preprocessed frames.
Oct 17 00:33:01 <sarbes>	At least all those I could find.
Oct 17 00:46:51 <sarbes>	NVM, I guess I found my answer: https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChapterCapture.html
