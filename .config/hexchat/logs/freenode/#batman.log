Mar 28 11:49:52 <RMPR>	Hello, I'm Paul a french student in computer science,I have a project about Batman-adv (specifically about Handover) and I have no clue on how to start, I found this document https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7796867 ,  but since there is already an implementation of this in openWRT, I wonder if somebody can provide some guidance to understand the basics?
