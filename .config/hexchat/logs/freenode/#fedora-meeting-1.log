Mar 18 15:55:33 <bcotton>	contyk: as our fesco rep, can i #action you to work with releng to develop a simple plan
Mar 18 15:55:46 <contyk>	Sure.
Mar 18 15:55:51 <mattdm>	I encourage you to start with ripping off the idea I proposed a few lines up :)
Mar 18 15:56:32 *	dgilmore notes that how builds are scheduled are baked into Koji's code
Mar 18 15:56:52 <bcotton>	#action contyk to work with release engineering to devleop a simple plan for how builds will be handled during the diminished build capacity window
Mar 18 15:57:04 <dgilmore>	all builds unless intentionally given a lower priority (mass rebuilds) have the same priority
Mar 18 15:57:44 <contyk>	Yeah.
Mar 18 15:58:04 <contyk>	That's why I think a separate channel with reserved builders is the only current option.
Mar 18 15:58:04 <mattdm>	I have to go because riecatnor and I have a meeting in 2 minutes.
Mar 18 15:58:05 <dgilmore>	we can ask people submitting large builds like a gnome or kde mass rebuild to lower the priority, but there is no way to enforce it
Mar 18 15:58:09 <mattdm>	bye and thanks all
Mar 18 15:58:19 <bcotton>	okay, last call for open floor

Mar 18 17:34:16 <dustymabe>	thanks all for coming!
Mar 18 17:34:20 <dustymabe>	i'll get started now
Mar 18 17:34:43 <dustymabe>	#topic Fedora CoreOS content for Community Central for RH Virtual Summit
Mar 18 17:34:43 *	zodbot has changed the topic to: Fedora CoreOS content for Community Central for RH Virtual Summit (Meeting topic: fedora_coreos_meeting)
Mar 18 17:34:49 <dustymabe>	#link https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/416
Mar 18 17:35:16 <dustymabe>	so RH summit is a virtual event this year
Mar 18 17:35:51 <dustymabe>	and one of our community leaders for Fedora is asking if we have any ideas for ways to show off FCOS in a demo
Mar 18 17:36:36 <dustymabe>	one of the features of FCOS (I think) is that it can be underwhelming depending on who you are, so this might be tough
Mar 18 17:36:48 <dustymabe>	but we do a lot of inovative things with the OS
Mar 18 17:36:52 <jlebon>	maybe at least one demo showing automatic updates?
Mar 18 17:37:12 <red_beard>	.hello redbeard
Mar 18 17:37:13 <zodbot>	red_beard: redbeard 'Brian 'redbeard' Harrington' <bharring@redhat.com>
Mar 18 17:37:15 <dustymabe>	jlebon: +1
Mar 18 17:37:25 <jlebon>	going into it too with the cincinnati graph could be interesting
Mar 18 17:37:50 <dustymabe>	jlebon: i.e. some of the mechanics behind the updates ?
Mar 18 17:38:05 <jlebon>	assuming people aren't familiar with ostree, just showing `rpm-ostree status` and explaining the output is always nice
Mar 18 17:38:26 <jlebon>	dustymabe: right, exactly
Mar 18 17:38:36 <jlebon>	just a bit to show it's not just a dumb polling thing
Mar 18 17:38:38 <red_beard>	honestly before that means anything to folks i think there's more brick laying to be done on going over why the OS is important.
Mar 18 17:39:03 <dustymabe>	jlebon: did we get readonly sysroot working? we could demo `rm -rf /` not breaking the system
Mar 18 17:39:13 <red_beard>	there's more than enough non-working demoware that gets cooked up every single year for summit.
Mar 18 17:39:33 <cyberpear>	lol, you'll still lose all user data
Mar 18 17:39:43 <jlebon>	dustymabe: yup good idea
Mar 18 17:39:54 <dustymabe>	cyberpear: who needs data :)
Mar 18 17:40:24 <dustymabe>	red_beard: any concrete ideas there? unfortunately we don't have a lot of time to do much more than short demos
Mar 18 17:40:33 <dustymabe>	but would love to do that
Mar 18 17:40:43 <miabbott>	.hello miabbott
Mar 18 17:40:44 <zodbot>	miabbott: miabbott 'Micah Abbott' <miabbott@redhat.com>
Mar 18 17:41:41 <dustymabe>	does anybody think a demo/overview of ignition would be useful?
Mar 18 17:42:51 <dustymabe>	#chair red_beard miabbott
Mar 18 17:42:51 <zodbot>	Current chairs: bgilbert cyberpear davdunc dustymabe jlebon ksinny miabbott mnguyen_ red_beard skunkerk
Mar 18 17:42:56 <ksinny>	I think so, perhaps showcasing ignition together with FCOS installation?
Mar 18 17:43:03 <jlebon>	dustymabe: yeah, i think so
Mar 18 17:43:31 <red_beard>	dustymabe, i guess my point was lost.  a demo just for the sake of having a demo isn't very interesting, especially when the majority of the audience doesn't understand why what you're building matters.
Mar 18 17:43:46 <dustymabe>	TBH I think the value of ignition is really illustrated when you do an openshift install - it's crazy how much information is transmitted and applied through Ignition
Mar 18 17:44:12 <red_beard>	if it's just to satisfy the community leader's itch, then they should already have an idea of what will resonate.  if they don't have an idea, than there is no cohesive narritive that's being conveyed.
Mar 18 17:44:30 <dustymabe>	red_beard: so you think it'd be worth having a full talk about FCOS, what the benefits are, and how we got here ?
Mar 18 17:45:05 <red_beard>	i do.  imagine that you _don't_ have that context... what is a demo actually showing off?
Mar 18 17:45:12 <miabbott>	to red_beard's point, we should demonstrate the fault tolerance of the update mechanism of the OS with container workloads in place.  in theory, we should be able to pull the plug on the system in the middle of an update and it will boot back up normally, with the workloads resumed
Mar 18 17:45:16 <red_beard>	it's no different than yum update in a cron job
Mar 18 17:45:42 <red_beard>	or... show off an intentionally broken update and show the system recovering
Mar 18 17:46:03 <jlebon>	right yeah, i think for the full effect, a presenter would need to cover the overall message while interspersing demos
Mar 18 17:46:43 <dustymabe>	jlebon: yeah that's probably best
Mar 18 17:47:16 <jlebon>	that might be more work than the person who opened that issue initially imagined though
Mar 18 17:47:36 <dustymabe>	yeah, i mean usually the community booth has talks at summit
Mar 18 17:47:44 <dustymabe>	they can range from 30-45 minutes
Mar 18 17:47:56 <dustymabe>	and they also do short demos at the booth itself for smaller audiences
Mar 18 17:48:05 <dustymabe>	so this could probably follow either of those forms
Mar 18 17:48:09 <jlebon>	ohh gotcha. ok yup, that's much better
Mar 18 17:48:29 <dustymabe>	we could have 1 "talk" that covers the overview along with interspersed demos
Mar 18 17:48:42 <dustymabe>	and we could also cut the demos out into short 5-10 minute clips to share separately
Mar 18 17:48:45 <dustymabe>	and link back to the talk
Mar 18 17:49:24 <dustymabe>	i'll enumerate some of these items.. in the meantime, any volunteers?
Mar 18 17:50:04 <dustymabe>	- show off ignition (simple example) + maybe show how much it's leveraged during an openshift/OKD install
Mar 18 17:50:21 <dustymabe>	- show off automatic updates
Mar 18 17:50:32 <dustymabe>	- show off a failed update and being able to recover
Mar 18 17:50:58 <dustymabe>	- show off immutability (possibly rm / protection)
Mar 18 17:51:10 <jlebon>	re. "- show off a failed update and being able to recover" - that... doesn't work yet.  unless we're talking about manually rolling back
Mar 18 17:51:22 <dustymabe>	i think manually rolling back would suffice for now
Mar 18 17:51:29 <dustymabe>	i know it's not where we want to be
Mar 18 17:51:33 <jlebon>	ack
Mar 18 17:52:20 <dustymabe>	- show off rpm-ostree status output (i.e. rich information about the OS)
Mar 18 17:52:46 <dustymabe>	anything else ?
Mar 18 17:53:54 <davdunc>	 a bare-metal install?
Mar 18 17:54:10 <dustymabe>	ok i'll put some of these in the ticket - i'll also ask riecatnor what the deadline is for something like this
Mar 18 17:54:29 <dustymabe>	davdunc: interesting suggestion from the AWS guy :)
Mar 18 17:54:48 <davdunc>	:D hey! hybrid is real.
Mar 18 17:55:06 <dustymabe>	davdunc: i'm not sure people would care much - probably assume bare-metal is table stakes
Mar 18 17:55:50 <dustymabe>	but I do suppose using Ignition with bare metal is a fairly new concept (i.e. something like cloud-init for non-cloud)
Mar 18 17:56:05 <dustymabe>	well, not brand new, but a lot of people probably don't think about it
Mar 18 17:56:25 <davdunc>	but it is very different from where they may have learned to use  coreos and with the impending support eol, they may want to know all the options.
Mar 18 17:56:55 <dustymabe>	+1
Mar 18 17:57:41 <dustymabe>	#info dustymabe will update #416 with suggestions for talk/demo for the Red Hat Summit virtual event and ask about deadline for such content
Mar 18 17:57:53 <dustymabe>	anything else before the next topic ?

Mar 19 16:07:12 <smooge>	ok fixing document
Mar 19 16:07:31 <nirik>	we should also add the 'contacting us' doc to the oncall links. I can do that after the meeting if everyone is ok with it.

Mar 19 16:10:32 <nirik>	cverna: ?
Mar 19 16:10:45 <cverna>	ok :)
Mar 19 16:11:07 <nirik>	I thought we wanted oncall to match when you are running the meeting so you remember you are running the meeting...
Mar 19 16:11:26 <smooge>	I think cverna thought he was agreeing to what we wrote that he would take oncall next week and meeting and you would do the next next meeting
Mar 19 16:11:36 <smooge>	uses the royal we
Mar 19 16:12:01 <cverna>	yeah I really don't mind, I can do this week or next, nirik up to you
Mar 19 16:12:05 <nirik>	ah, ok.
Mar 19 16:12:05 <smooge>	anyway..
Mar 19 16:12:09 <nirik>	I don't care either. ;)

Mar 19 16:13:17 <smooge>	that is all
Mar 19 16:13:23 <cverna>	lol ok so nirik you do this week and I ll do next :)
Mar 19 16:13:31 <cverna>	+1
Mar 19 16:13:49 <nirik>	ok, ack
Mar 19 16:13:50 <smooge>	anyway.. nirik does this week, cverna does next week, pingou thinks about doing the week afterwords
Mar 19 16:14:12 *	pingou hoping not to land this on smooge the week afterword

Mar 19 16:14:23 <smooge>	he will be running a wire to his boat which he will have flipped over as his man cave
Mar 19 16:14:36 <pingou>	I do wonder if we shouldn't cycle oncall through all sysadmin-main

Mar 19 16:15:05 <pingou>	(you get super-power, but you get to be oncall once in a while)
Mar 19 16:15:07 <nirik>	well, some are not as active anymore. ;)
Mar 19 16:15:16 <pingou>	spring cleaning time? :)
Mar 19 16:15:22 <pingou>	oh wait, we have to wait 2 days for this
Mar 19 16:15:23 <smooge>	maybe they should be in sysadmin-emeritius
Mar 19 16:15:30 <tflink>	I don't anticipate being sysadmin-main after taskotron goes EOL next month
Mar 19 16:15:39 <nirik>	well, perhaps. But last I asked, most of them wanted to remain.
Mar 19 16:15:49 <cverna>	pingou: I think it is not limited to sysadmin-main, anyone can do it this is mostly a filter for requests
Mar 19 16:15:55 <pingou>	nirik: oncall may change their mind :D
Mar 19 16:16:01 <pingou>	cverna: agreed
Mar 19 16:16:06 <mizdebsk>	i can participate in oncall if needed
Mar 19 16:16:17 <mizdebsk>	but people seem to eagerly take it before i do :)
Mar 19 16:16:21 <pbrobinson>	I don't use it much but it's useful for me because it means I don't need to put load on others to get IoT things done

Mar 19 16:16:52 *	zodbot has changed the topic to: Monitoring discussion [nirik] (Meeting topic: Infrastructure (2020-03-19))
Mar 19 16:16:58 <pbrobinson>	I physically don't have the bandwidth to do on call though, so if that becomes a requirement I'll just remove it and file tickets for the things I do now
Mar 19 16:17:33 <tflink>	yeah, same here. I'm game for leaving sysadmin-main but that'll mean more work for you all in terms of deprecating and turning off taskotron
Mar 19 16:17:40 <nirik>	ok, there's an aarch64 builder down, we can try re-power cycling it.
Mar 19 16:18:25 <nirik>	well, I don't want us to have more work. :) but perhaps we should consider this and discuss it as another topic down the road?
Mar 19 16:18:48 <pingou>	it was an idea, it's fine turning it down
Mar 19 16:19:12 <nirik>	there's a bunch of virthosts low on swap, which is a rhel8 kernel bug... I wonder if we shouldn't do a update/reboot cycle next week?
Mar 19 16:19:36 <smooge>	i don't think the kernel bug has been pushed out yet
Mar 19 16:19:44 <smooge>	kernel bug fix
Mar 19 16:19:50 <nirik>	there's a whatcanidoforfedora.org cert issue. That should be fixed by running the playbook, which I can do.
Mar 19 16:20:08 <smooge>	nirik, ok thanks on that.
Mar 19 16:20:29 <smooge>	nirik, the power cycle problem is still with the pdu not working. I need to put in a ticket for that
Mar 19 16:20:42 <nirik>	qa-stg01.qa.fedoraproject.org - Disk_Space_/
Mar 19 16:20:51 <nirik>	tflink: ^ perhaps you could look at that one?
Mar 19 16:21:07 <nirik>	proxy31 is the other one.
Mar 19 16:21:52 <nirik>	note: to get registry working on proxy31 you MUST run the oci-registries playbook. It updates the firewall there based on the proxy group... so if you add something there you have to re-run it there to update the iptables setup
Mar 19 16:21:52 <tflink>	nirik: yeah, I need to delete that host. I was waiting for beta freeze to end
Mar 19 16:22:28 <nirik>	ok, anytime now then. ;)
Mar 19 16:22:49 <tflink>	yeah, it's on my todo list for today
Mar 19 16:23:21 <smooge>	nirik, ok I didn't know that. I will run the playbook before I add proxy31 to being an active proxy
Mar 19 16:23:54 <tflink>	resultsdb01.qa is also having swap issues but we're not sure why. the swap just gradually goes to 0 until httpd is restarted
Mar 19 16:24:16 <nirik>	some kind of leak in httpd?

Mar 19 16:27:01 <cverna>	ha yeah this is last week
Mar 19 16:27:29 <cverna>	I forgot to update that, but we can use the mailing list for it
Mar 19 16:27:30 <smooge>	I am going to put you as the owner of this section in future meetings
Mar 19 16:27:42 <cverna>	+1
Mar 19 16:27:55 <nirik>	do we think thats helping out? I like it so far... would be good to get more input... but oh well.
Mar 19 16:28:35 <nirik>	we even have one in the best state...
Mar 19 16:28:39 <smooge>	i think at this point it is too soon to know if it is helping or not. I don't see a large pool of people having any time to help out so our input is what it is
Mar 19 16:28:41 <cverna>	I find value in it, that allow to share more info about these tickets
Mar 19 16:28:43 <nirik>	.ticket 8167
Mar 19 16:28:44 <pingou>	as an outsider, I have sometime issues evaluating the amount of work
Mar 19 16:28:45 <zodbot>	nirik: Issue #8167: Adding topic authorization to our RabbitMQ instances - fedora-infrastructure - Pagure.io - https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/issue/8167
Mar 19 16:29:07 <nirik>	low-trouble, high-gain.
Mar 19 16:29:15 <pingou>	+1 on the high gain
Mar 19 16:29:16 <nirik>	yeah, we are all bad at estimating. ;)
Mar 19 16:29:51 <cverna>	yeah now tat freeze is over we could try to work on that
Mar 19 16:30:19 <nirik>	stg should be the new version (we still need to update prod)
Mar 19 16:31:18 <cverna>	is it a matter of adapting the playbook and running it against prod ?
Mar 19 16:31:41 <pingou>	we had a few issues in stg where users/queues were not correctly re-created
Mar 19 16:31:50 <pingou>	we may need to see how we can fix this
Mar 19 16:32:23 <nirik>	cverna: the upgrade for prod? no. Thats: take the cluster down, reinstall as rhel8, resetup cluster
Mar 19 16:32:24 <pingou>	maybe add the tag in the rabbitmq/... roles so if some app role don't have the corresponding tag, we can still re-create?
Mar 19 16:32:49 <cverna>	nirik: ha ok a bit more work then :)
Mar 19 16:32:51 <nirik>	yeah, I think tags were incomplete...
Mar 19 16:33:06 <nirik>	cverna: the actual setting up of the auth still needs doing tho.
Mar 19 16:33:15 <nirik>	(in stg)
Mar 19 16:33:23 <smooge>	tflink, I see an item in the agenda for moving stuff to openshift.. is that for this meeting or last?
Mar 19 16:33:41 <tflink>	last meeting, I think
Mar 19 16:33:49 *	tflink looks in case he forgot adding something
Mar 19 16:33:59 *	relrod waves and checks into the meeting super late.
Mar 19 16:34:19 <smooge>	relrod you have oncall in 3 weeks :P
Mar 19 16:34:49 <tflink>	smooge: yeah, that was last week
Mar 19 16:34:56 <pingou>	hey relrod
Mar 19 16:35:09 <relrod>	smooge: Let's see what my new workload looks like for a bit first ;)
Mar 19 16:35:24 <relrod>	I'd not be opposed to occasionally taking a shift to stay in the loop though.

Mar 19 17:08:50 <x3mboy>	Sorry to interrupt
Mar 19 17:09:17 <x3mboy>	I've made a PR in src.fp.o to the screenfetch package, and I have no response
Mar 19 17:09:35 <x3mboy>	To the point that the package that will be included in F32 is outdated
Mar 19 17:09:48 <x3mboy>	But I don't know how to proceed to have an answer
Mar 19 17:10:19 <decathorpe>	have you tried to email the package owner directly?
Mar 19 17:10:25 <decathorpe>	not everybody gets notifications for PRs.
Mar 19 17:10:39 <x3mboy>	No, I wasn't sure that was the proper way to go
Mar 19 17:10:46 <x3mboy>	But I can do it. No problem
Mar 19 17:10:50 <x3mboy>	Thanks for the guidance

Apr 02 16:18:38 <nirik>	the daily stuff has been really helpfull. ;) as has the discuss backlog on list.
Apr 02 16:18:46 <pingou>	cverna++
Apr 02 16:19:49 <mkonecny>	The weekly refinement of tickets is really nice thing
Apr 02 16:19:53 <cverna>	yeah I like the weekly discuss on the list because it forces us to look back at some old tickets
Apr 02 16:20:15 <cverna>	and sometimes we can just close them :)
Apr 02 16:20:55 <cverna>	I don't think there is anything else for today so I guess it is time for

Apr 02 16:21:53 <cverna>	Anything for the Open Floor ?
Apr 02 16:22:11 <nirik>	not much today.
Apr 02 16:23:11 <cverna>	for me with the DST thing it will be a bit more challenging for me to attend every week at this time. Even more so with the lockdown all the familly is stuck at home
Apr 02 16:23:28 <cverna>	but let's see how that goes
Apr 02 16:23:40 <nirik>	curse you DST! :(
Apr 02 16:24:16 <mkonecny>	The lockdown isn't great :-(
Apr 02 16:24:27 <cverna>	yeah :)
Apr 02 16:24:37 *	tflink prepares a pitchfork and torch for the march against DST
Apr 02 16:24:41 <mkonecny>	And the DST is just gift from hell :-D
Apr 02 16:25:04 <nirik>	I sure hope we drop it soon, but it never seems to happen.
Apr 02 16:25:23 <smooge>	DST or the quarentine?
Apr 02 16:25:24 <cverna>	haha mkonecny I like that one
Apr 02 16:25:42 <pingou>	tflink: we're in April :)
Apr 02 16:25:44 <nirik>	smooge: DST
Apr 02 16:25:47 <smooge>	thanks for running
Apr 02 16:25:49 *	cverna hopes the quarentine will be a yearly thing like DST
Apr 02 16:26:11 <pingou>	you do or you don't? :)
Apr 02 16:26:14 <cverna>	oh no I don't hope it will be :P
