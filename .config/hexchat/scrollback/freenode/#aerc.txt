T 1561643711 18<22ddevault18>	what follows is my three part rebuttal:
T 1561643735 18<22ddevault18>	(1) the correct approach results in a smaller message and unlike the last time this came up, doesn't require draining a reader into memory to accomplish
T 1561643748 18<22ddevault18>	(2) the code already determines if quoting is necessary for the address part
T 1561643764 18<22ddevault18>	(3) humans do read mime messages often enough for it to matter
T 1561643897 18<25bandali18>	ha, makes sense to me
T 1561644172 18<29kgz18>	mfw I think I've already signed the cla
T 1561644266 18<25bandali18>	hm, i think the only cla i ever signed was clojure’s, but that’s before i knew better :p and didn’t actually end up contributing anything to it anyway either
T 1561644414 18<22emersion18>	if i had the code copied over already i'd consider
T 1561644433 18<22emersion18>	but copying the code just for this is a little bit too much

T 1577999416 18<26gcraggs18>	Hi All - Just installed aerc, but when trying to launch it I'm getting "panic: character set not supported". I've tried in both Alacritty and termite. Any suggestions on how to get it working? (aerc -v = 0.3.0)
T 1577999803 18<28bookworm18>	what's your TERM/locale?
T 1578000136 18<26gcraggs18>	en_GB.UTF_8 - just been digging through the tcell source and tried setting TERM=UTF_8 which solves the issue
T 1578000324 18<26gcraggs18>	Not sure if en_GB.UTF_8 is a valid value, or where it's being set though
T 1578000512 18<28bookworm18>	not on my system
T 1578000545 18<28bookworm18>	what Distro are you on? For me the locale is called en_GB.UTF-8, note the '-' instead of the underscore
T 1578000688 18<28bookworm18>	if you have a systemd based distro you can query the locales with `localectl list-locales`
T 1578001009 18<26gcraggs18>	I'm using arch. That command lists only the locale you have, so I must have an invalid configuration somewhere. Thanks for helping me! Don't suppose you know where the locale would be set?
T 1578001195 18<26gcraggs18>	Nevermind, looks like localectl can set that too. Thanks again for helping!
T 1578001470 18<28bookworm18>	that command lists the *available* locales :)

T 1586526951 18<28noctux18>	hmm, I recently installed aerc and it works surprisingly well. However, I cannot seem to find a good multiaccount workflow with it... My mutt setup usually involves having a sidebar across all my accounts, so checking mail is easy. However, with aerc, I always have 3 tabs, and just checking whether anything relevant has happend involves cycling three to four tabs... is there any smarter way? How do
T 1586526953 18<28noctux18>	other people deal with it?
T 1586527517 18<28bookworm18>	notmuch
T 1586527539 18<28bookworm18>	though you'll need to adapt your workflows quite a bit
T 1586527674 18<28noctux18>	yeah, I try to get around notmuch, as in my (albeight older) experience, you want to use notmuch on all endpoints, because it did not interact that well with regular imap-muas such as K9 on my phone
T 1586527726 18<28noctux18>	but maybe I was just stupid back then :)
T 1586527763 18<28bookworm18>	well yes, but you can also just sync back the changes with something like lieer in the case of gmail
T 1586527809 18<28bookworm18>	I personally don't care much about the folder a mail is in, I use sieve to keep my main inbox semi clean but that's about it
T 1586527860 18<28bookworm18>	and to be honest, who can handle mail on a phone? No threading, garbage editing capabilities... everything longer than 2 sentences gives me the creeps if I need to type it on the phone
T 1586528855 18<28noctux18>	part of the pros about controlling the folders: finding a particular message when you are on the phone and searching for it :)
T 1586528891 18<28noctux18>	writing on the phone is admittingly quite a pain... and only made worse by the fact that k9 insists on composing html-mails
T 1586528962 18<28bookworm18>	you can turn that off
T 1586528973 18<28bookworm18>	but k9s editor is still a pain
T 1586528984 18<28bookworm18>	but I didn't find a better app than it, so K9 it is

T 1587582908 18<28bookworm18>	you could try and set the content type header manually, if you are lucky the current implementation will update it in place, but I didn't test that
T 1587586343 18<26pepper_chico18>	heywoodlh: you may write text email and pass it to a filter to attach an html part automatically, which can have this signature embedded.

T 1587589416 18<28heywoodlh18>	pepper_chico, being able to use Markdown in a message sounds amazing.
T 1587589848 18<26pepper_chico18>	heywoodlh: I have reapplied an old recipe (https://nosubstance.me/post/mutt-secret-sauce/) for aerc. Needs this updated script: https://gist.github.com/oblitum/6eeffaebd9a4744e762e49e6eb19d189#file-mimembellish-fixed-for-aerc. The post explains its use.

T 1587589969 18<26pepper_chico18>	today there's some stuff there I don't use anymore, for example, I don't run a preview daemon anymore because iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim is enough and much better for [neo]vim previewing

T 1587590096 18<28heywoodlh18>	Yeah, that makes sense. I'm kind of just getting started with Aerc, configuring it, etc. so ironing out all these workflows for me now is super helpful.

T 1587590189 18<26pepper_chico18>	np, moving to aerc also removed the need for multiple instances per account for me, I had to do that with mutt cuz their multiple account support was really bad

T 1613514529 18<28bookworm18>	as the proper command is :save [-fp] <path>
T 1613514566 18<28bookworm18>	else what you give is multiple arguments to :save, <filename> and "-f"
T 1613514570 18<28bookworm18>	which is, well, garbage
T 1613514667 18<28bookworm18>	to get the icing on the cake, specifying multiple arguments to save will helpfully concatenate the strings to a single file path

T 1614360261 18<28bookworm18>	fluix: yes, the tokenizer we use from the stdlib works this way
T 1614362446 18<24fluix18>	does that not break quoting git patches?
T 1614362569 18<24fluix18>	also correcting what I said, it seems to affect duplicate whitespace anywhere in the line (or at least after the + or - of patches)
T 1614362655 18<28bookworm18>	fluix: depends, quoted patches are invalid patches anyhow. Of you are writing python it's rather bad yes. And yes, it affects everything as it's using the exact same tokenizer
T 1614362677 18<28bookworm18>	but honestly if you are quoting patches you should not be wrapping in any case
T 1614362695 18<28bookworm18>	so you need to use a different template than one for plain text
T 1614362712 18<24fluix18>	is replying on a patch by quoting on it and adding comments the wrong way to do things?
T 1614362737 18<28bookworm18>	no that's what you should be doing, but that's not a patch any longer ;)
T 1614362750 18<28bookworm18>	so it can't "break"
T 1614362752 18<24fluix18>	oh yeah, I understand it's no longer a patch
T 1614362812 18<24fluix18>	just became a little difficult to read without indentation :D
T 1614362819 18<24fluix18>	thanks for the info though, makes sense
T 1614362835 18<28bookworm18>	in my opinion you should never rewrap things... just send them back exactly how the sender sent them, prefixed with "> "
T 1614362867 18<28bookworm18>	and then keep within 80 chars or whatever for your original content
T 1614362870 18<24fluix18>	well yes, that's why the removal of duplicate whitespace got me a bit confused
T 1614362886 18<28bookworm18>	it only does that if you wrap no?
T 1614362896 18<28bookworm18>	does this happen for pure quoting too?
T 1614362913 18<24fluix18>	like I have a patch, use rq, the lines don't get re-wrapped but the quoted text is missing whitespace
T 1614362933 18<28bookworm18>	rq doesn't tell me anything, what's your reply template? That's what matters
T 1614362943 18<24fluix18>	whatever the default is I believe
T 1614362966 18<28bookworm18>	then you are re-wrapping the lines to ~80 chars
T 1614362973 18<28bookworm18>	don't do that :)
T 1614362977 18<24fluix18>	that's certainly not happening
T 1614362984 18<24fluix18>	oh wait
T 1614362991 18<24fluix18>	ok maybe that _is_ happening
T 1614363016 18<24fluix18>	so is the solution writing my own template?
T 1614363024 18<28bookworm18>	https://git.labrat.space/aerc/tree/templates/quoted_reply
T 1614363030 18<28bookworm18>	yes
T 1614363057 18<28bookworm18>	72... enough to stay within 80 chars if quoted a bunch of times
