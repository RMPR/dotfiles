T 1555933263 18<TheWild18>	I have some trouble with ddrescue (or just that my CD/DVD reader is buggy). Recovering a CD (1.iso). Well, some sectors couldn't be read at first but were read eventually after some work from ddrescue. Some couldn't be read at all. Eject, clean up, try again with "retry" flag. Done. 100%.
