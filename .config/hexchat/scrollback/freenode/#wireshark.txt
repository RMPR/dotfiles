T 1570830976 18<25TMM18>	Hi all, I'm working on reverse engineering a usb protocol. How it works now is that I have a Windows VM with a passed through USB device with wireshark in the guest. Is it possible to passively read all of the data going over the usb bus from the host as well? I'm writing a sort of 'proof tool' that currently replays the pcap file and I see if I see what I expect.
T 1570830990 18<25TMM18>	However, without the exact data being read from the sensors while running I can't actually be entirely sure
T 1570831028 18<25TMM18>	so I'd like to be able basically run my validation tool on the host entirely passively (just checking if the values I would've sent match what the windows vm sends)
T 1570831042 18<25TMM18>	and so I can validate that I see the same values in the windows app as I see on my passive tool
T 1570831638 18<20maslen18>	I'm not an expert, but if it's  a passed through USB, wouldn't the guest be able to see all traffic?
T 1570831644 18<20maslen18>	the wireshark running on the guest * ?
T 1570831659 18<20maslen18>	Alternative option though is to also run wireshark on the host
T 1570831948 18<20maslen18>	host will always see everything

T 1571617114 18<24nmz78718>	I figured out a few things in wireshark filtering on the ip.src and scrolling through the packet list based on some notes I took (i.e. I clicked a command and noted what packet # was displayed in tshark at the time)
T 1571617127 18<24nmz78718>	so I have been able to localize a few packets that contain some commands
T 1571617151 18<24nmz78718>	they always show up in the byte pane as blue text, which I seem to have determined is user-data, versus protocol-level data

T 1582926467 18<20agentxcell18>	I have a weird question. Is there any way to identify a certain piece of harware via TCP? We want to allow only connections from thin clients so I am trying to figure out if I can finger print packets coming from the thin clients?

T 1582926555 18<20agentxcell18>	we would be filtering way to many, it isn't really an option

T 1582926649 18<20agentxcell18>	for reference, we are an msp, the client has many employees that work from home 70+ so the macs would be from their home network, correct?
T 1582926747 18<19d0rm0us318>	yes
T 1582927094 18<20agentxcell18>	That seems like nightmare fuel. Hence why we were trying to figure out if there was something unique that we could fingerprint packets off of based on whether it was a thin client or not. It does update a registry key when loggin onto the server so we could right a script at log on that checks for that key and boots them if it is not there but we wanted to deny the connection before it go to that point
T 1582927095 18<20agentxcell18>	versus after they are logged on. Negligible but it seems the script might be the best option if there is no clear way to fingerprint the devices.
