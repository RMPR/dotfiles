T 1560520171 18<20FromGitter18>	<magonreal> On my work computer we have emacs 25.1.1, and my spacemacs on develop branch complains at every startup that `An error occurred while installing blacken (error: (error Package ‚Äòemacs-25.2‚Äô is unavailable))`. The same message also appears for lsp-treemacs, treemacs, and treemacs-projectile. Is there something I can do to suppress spacemacs from trying to install that at every startup?
