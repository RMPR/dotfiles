T 1582988327 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> @Martinsos sorry, I didn't find it clear why you want to run Emacs in a terminal.  It is just because you are doing Git on the command line? You can configure `.spacemacs` to run a persistent server, there is specific entries for this already.  You can configure `.gitconfig` to use `emacsclient` as it's editor, so if you don't specify a message, then `emacsclient` will be used to open a buffer in Emacs instantly.  
T 1582988327 18<20FromGitter18>	... If it's only for got, you could instead use Magit.  Add the `git` layer to `.spacemacs` and use `SPC g s` to open git status, from where you can stage, commit, pull, push, etc.

Currently, there's no standard keycode defined for sending `C-<ret>` to app running inside terminal, hence emacs can't do much about that. What you can do is, rebind those functions for something which gets recognized inside terminal emacs.

T 1587382811 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> @magthe `SPC l o o` is a custom layout that comes with Spacemacs and displays your org-agenda files. I'd suggest creating your own custom layout https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#custom-layouts
T 1587382850 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> Alternatively, search the Spacemacs source code for the definition and see how it works.

T 1587383586 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> @cviebig `SPC h d F` will list all the faces used in the current theme.  Try typing in `mode-line` or `persp` to narrow that list of faces and see which one matches the color you want to change.
T 1587383668 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> There may be a better way that that, but that is what I would try.  For faces in the text of a buffer, you can use `SPC h d c` and it will show the face used for that character as part of the description

T 1587653021 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> Someone asked about Helm loosing focus when clicking elsewhere with the mouse, eg. like switching to a different application window and back again.  Using `SPC w b` gets the focus back on helm.  So if you `SPC f f` and click somewhere else its not possible to type, but `SPC w b` focuses the mini-buffer window and therefore helm.
T 1587653265 18<20FromGitter18>	<witek> Hello. I would like to rename all occurences of a symbol. I have VIM keybindings. After typing `*` while having the cursor on the symbol, the  Symbol Highlight Transient State comes up. After typing `e`, I get into a "red" mode - but I can't figure out, how to use it. I have tried `cw` and have renamed the symbol under the cursor, but only this one. All others remain the same. What am I missing? Thank you!

T 1603189093 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Haha... yeah that is annoying

T 1603191643 18<20FromGitter18>	<chama-chomo> actually, i'm not decided what should be the default. There are some cases you don't want to have it closed right away and you want to follow up errors compilator gave you. I think it makes sense
T 1603191805 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Yeah, I get your point. I would just prefer if the compilation window was selected, so you could delete it with q, or switch back to your code without closing it

I am trying out the Mu4e layer and anytime I am in a mu4e buffer (main view or header view)  <SPC> doesn't respond as it shoul  ( i get `End of buffer`) so I basically get stuck in the buffer and my only option is to quit...

T 1613471170 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> I guess this should get (better) documented indeed
T 1613471506 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> @dalanicolai Thanks for your comment :) ‚èé Could you guide me on how to set this up?
T 1613471549 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Well it was long ago that I set this up
T 1613471560 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> But I see that I used `subfile` to import files in the mainfile
T 1613471600 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> So it does not work when you activate reftex-mode manually in the Latex buffer?
T 1613471616 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> I find it should get activated automatically (there is a hook in the layer)
T 1613471624 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> I had not gone this far last time I tried
T 1613471635 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> I will try and let you know
T 1613471642 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Yes good...
T 1613471645 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> How do you activate the reftex-mode manually?
T 1613471656 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Yes
T 1613471691 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> And now it seems to get activated automatically
T 1613471748 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> So I had to do it manually only once (which seems weird to me, but it was the case here)
T 1613471782 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> I get that in a `.tex` buffer I need to press `SPC m r` to get in the `reftex` menu. But what do I need to do once there?
T 1613471801 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> just type `SPC SPC reftex-mode`
T 1613471854 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> Apparently it was activated by default
T 1613471872 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> But still I don't get any suggestion when typing in my `\cite{...}`
T 1613471874 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Ah yeah... well that is how it should work
T 1613471898 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> am I missing something?
T 1613471916 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Well I am not sure why it did not work the last time here, maybe because I just installed the latex layer
T 1613471927 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> And then just reopened the file
T 1613471931 18<20FromGitter18>	<inzouzouwetrust> I must explain that I'm typing this `\cite{...}` command in a `.tex` file that does not contain a bib explicitely

T 1613471969 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Anyway... now I restarted Emacs, to see if I had again to activate `reftex-mode` manually, and now completion does not work

T 1614081274 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> greetings, probably a noobish question: in emacs lisp, how do i choose a different value if one value is nil? e.g. `(choose-non-nil (could-evaluate-to-nil) (always-non-nil))`. ‚èé For context, Im trying to handle an optional argument for a function.
T 1614081411 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> @iliekprogrammar I guess you are looking for `or`?
T 1614081456 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> oh it works like in lua. quite nice.
T 1614081489 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Ah... don't know lua
T 1614081549 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> it's a neat language. I learnt it for neovim's new support for lua configurations.
T 1614081609 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> but the way emacs' built is just miles better than lua support
T 1614081655 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Yeah I quickly had a look at lua, when I read positive things about it
T 1614081677 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> But I think I remember it looked like python, just little less nice
T 1614081714 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> metatables sold it for me
T 1614081744 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Yeah... the introspection in emacs is great. And lisp is a beautiful language too
T 1614081780 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> never would i have ever thought to love parenthesis abuse
T 1614081846 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Haha... maybe it is not abuse after all
T 1614081912 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> I quickly searched for `metatable`... from the explanation in Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatable) it sounds like lisp is all metatable...
T 1614081967 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> But I do not really know what I am talking about... just the 'holding data that acts as source code' part
T 1614082061 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> in lua, it basically means you change how operations interact with the object/table. ‚èé  ‚èé say i want union operation for sets. I can override the + operator using metatables.
T 1614082146 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> the table holds the data, acting as the source code, that defines its behaviour.
T 1614082161 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> pretty OOP-like, really
T 1614082194 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Ah... I have read that lisp offers plenty of tricks for that I think... but I still need to learn those tricks
T 1614082289 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> another way to use metatable is to create builders or prototypes
T 1614082331 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Haha... okay I still need to learn a lot... I am only a hobby programmer
T 1614082346 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> but of course, the thing that people remember most about lua is that its 1-indexed
T 1614082382 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> and many fail to hint the fact that metatables can change that to the more sensible 2-indexed system
T 1614082433 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Ah don't know what that means
T 1614082445 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> I thought you meant 1 vs 0-indexed
T 1614082450 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> But 2-indexed?
T 1614082457 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> yes, that's correct
T 1614082467 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> metatables results in any-indexed
T 1614082498 18<20FromGitter18>	<dalanicolai> Haha sounds confuding
T 1614082498 18<20FromGitter18>	<iliekprogrammar> truly a powerful feature :D

T 1617309529 18<20FromGitter18>	<triccare> Just realized what might be the issue. Depending on what emacs distro is being used, this may be a sign of file permission issues. Search for "emacs file system access". I cannot verify since my system is company-owned and have to wait for sysadmins to make the necessary security allowance. This has to do with Catalina's new security model.

T 1617819084 18<20FromGitter18>	<alexey0308> if you add  `(setq debug-on-error t)` to the init.el file, it should show more information about the reason.
