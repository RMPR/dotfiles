T 1560520171 18<20FromGitter18>	<magonreal> On my work computer we have emacs 25.1.1, and my spacemacs on develop branch complains at every startup that `An error occurred while installing blacken (error: (error Package ‚Äòemacs-25.2‚Äô is unavailable))`. The same message also appears for lsp-treemacs, treemacs, and treemacs-projectile. Is there something I can do to suppress spacemacs from trying to install that at every startup?

T 1582988327 18<20FromGitter18>	<jr0cket> @Martinsos sorry, I didn't find it clear why you want to run Emacs in a terminal.  It is just because you are doing Git on the command line? You can configure `.spacemacs` to run a persistent server, there is specific entries for this already.  You can configure `.gitconfig` to use `emacsclient` as it's editor, so if you don't specify a message, then `emacsclient` will be used to open a buffer in Emacs instantly.  
T 1582988327 18<20FromGitter18>	... If it's only for got, you could instead use Magit.  Add the `git` layer to `.spacemacs` and use `SPC g s` to open git status, from where you can stage, commit, pull, push, etc.

Currently, there's no standard keycode defined for sending `C-<ret>` to app running inside terminal, hence emacs can't do much about that. What you can do is, rebind those functions for something which gets recognized inside terminal emacs.

E.g. you type ```Hello keytrigger World!". Suppose ```keytrigger``` is a key that can be expanded into ```${1:my} ${2:very} ${3:beautiful}```. When you go to the end of ```keytrigger``` and press ```C-p``` for expand, it actually breaks everything into two lines: Lineno 1: ```Hello my very
