T 1587051991 18<27hodapp18>	hm, I guess org-match-sparse-tree doesn't really do what I want. I might have to roll some makeshift org parsing to do this myself

T 1587369414 18<26kensanata18>	I'd probably start by doing M-x mu4e SPACE thread and see what completions show up. Perhaps you need to enable ivy-mode do have that expand into all the possible commands, I don't know.

T 1587369972 18<20bpalmer18>	Hmm, the US's postal service may go bankrupt by the fall. 
T 1587369994 18<20bpalmer18>	seems like there's a call to arms going around to buy stamps and send physical mail
T 1587369994 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: you mean it was turning a profit before?
T 1587370000 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: that's DEEPLY bad
T 1587370022 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: postal systems are supposed to operate at a loss because they generate positive externalities
T 1587370051 18<20bpalmer18>	twb: since the 2000s, I think, it's been directed both to run a profit and to fully pay for pensions 30 years in the future (unlike any private pension).
T 1587370052 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: the same as road builders or metros or swimming pools
T 1587370068 18<20bpalmer18>	and forbidden from closing unprofitable stations.
T 1587370073 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I know Auspost (our equivalent) has gone bankrupt 3 times since 2000
T 1587370085 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: each time basically cheating by having e.g. a retail store chain
T 1587370097 18<19twb18>	and using that to offset the losses of the actual important bit
T 1587370112 18<20bpalmer18>	There is a widespread belief that this is aimed at making it go bankrupt so that then it can be privatized somehow.
T 1587370128 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: of course -- asset stripping
T 1587370152 18<19twb18>	Also they tripled the postage a few years ago, and sent a thing out saying basically "99% of post is banks and corporate and spam, so what the fuck do you care?"
T 1587370172 18<19twb18>	Also I think they gave pensioners 100 free stamps a year for life
T 1587370187 18<19twb18>	since pensioners are the only _voters_ who might give a shit
T 1587370192 18<20bpalmer18>	ah, the US raised postage rates a long while back but made a stamp valid for life.
T 1587370240 18<20bpalmer18>	so if you bought $50/worth of stamps in 2008 (say that was 100 stamps at the time), you'll be able to send 100 first class letters.
T 1587370369 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I think here stamps have face value in cents
T 1587370383 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so if you buy a 30c stamp today, it's worth 30c of 2050 money in 2050
T 1587370390 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: i.e. inflation happens
T 1587370425 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: did you know when post was cool, there were as many as 9 separate deliveries per day
T 1587370449 18<20bpalmer18>	I did not know that.
T 1587370458 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: and there was this one guy who single-handedly convinced the government to change things from cash-on-delivery to the modern stamp system
T 1587370463 18<20bpalmer18>	I do know that in the 19th century, upper class British folks could do multiple exchanges in a day
T 1587370475 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: you used to have to pay to receive a letter, but you could refuse and not open it
T 1587370486 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so people worked out you could encode short messages in the recipient name
T 1587370506 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: like "To: Alice 'Mum's Dead' Smith"
T 1587370529 18<19twb18>	And back then (before stamps) it was like $20 to receive a message, instead of $1 to send one
T 1587370545 18<19twb18>	So only super rich people routinely sent post
T 1587370970 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: imagine a world in which you can send mail to anybody you want.
T 1587370993 18<24rudybot18>	bpalmer: I find it hard to imagine that anybody really believes that stuff
T 1587371070 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: you're right. You need to choose the right color envelope and have the proper return address if you want people to open it.
T 1587371092 18<24rudybot18>	bpalmer: just send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the address on your screen
T 1587371525 18<19twb18>	Let's each send a copy of Ulysses to bpalmer's work address every day for a year
T 1587371565 18<20bpalmer18>	the route each takes will be an adventure 20 years in the making
T 1587371881 18<26loskutak18>	Hi, has anybody done org-mode startup visibility based on elisp predicates?  Basically, I would like datetree view with several previous days showing entry headings, this year showing month headings and the other years being collapsed.  So far, I set up each year with visibility property manually, but I don't want to do that for each day.

T 1587453621 18<26lockywolf18>	I mean, binding is important at the moment of application, where is determines which objects are visible to the function body. I can easily imagine (define) defining functions that have access to the definition environment, (defun) to define ones that access runtime-environment objects, and, say (defpure) for functions that only have access to opencoded primitives.

T 1587489289 18<19paluche18>	I'd like to override a dired binding only for a specific dired buffer. Is this possible?
T 1587489332 18<19wasamasa18>	this is what local-set-key is designed for

T 1587489358 18<19paluche18>	but "The binding goes in the current bufferâs local map, which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode."
T 1587489387 18<20bpalmer18>	paluche: create a new key map which has as its parent the current active keymap
T 1587489394 18<20bpalmer18>	paluche: then local set key into that new keymap

T 1587489501 18<19wasamasa18>	wow, that's a bit more involved than I've hoped for
T 1587489516 18<19wasamasa18>	this leaves the question, just what exactly is `local-set-key' even good for?

T 1587489532 18<19wasamasa18>	but you can do that without it just fine

T 1587489580 18<26kiraslaugh18>	hey everyone, just wondering if we can discuss doom emacs here? I normally run emacs but decided to give doom a try.

T 1587489683 18<26kiraslaugh18>	yeah it seems kind of odd. After using emacs configuration for doom seems really weird. 
T 1587489755 18<25cvandusen18>	maybe they misnamed it.

If you ââ¥ away from Emacs, but stay away from Emacs for like thirty seconds, then switch back to Emacs, is the switch back immediate?

T 1587498933 18<22adgtl18>	This bug persisted due to Dimmer package.

T 1587498982 18<20dale18>	Well, it isn't strange that he is on macOS.  It is strange that macOS would have such a severe bug but he wouldn't notice it.  Assuming he uses his own library.
T 1587499037 18<24ryouma18>	the author of the package seems at cursory glance to mistake window for buffer

T 1587499179 18<20dale18>	adgtl: IIRC you do need to profiler-stop *after* you profiler-report.

T 1587499198 18<22adgtl18>	dale okay
T 1587499198 18<29wgreenhouse18>	right, profiler is still running right now otherwise
T 1587499260 18<29wgreenhouse18>	ryouma: just contemplating the insanity if they somehow really do mean buffer and not window
T 1587499363 18<22adgtl18>	Anyone uses magit? I recently started it to resolve conflicts.. but I don't like coloring .. anyone know how to configure better coloring?
T 1587499370 18<20dale18>	adgtl: FWIW just did a clean install of dimmer into Emacs 26.3 NeXTStep port on macOS 10.14, and I get no problems switching back and forth with dimmer, so it probably takes more than just dimmer to reproduce.
T 1587499413 18<22adgtl18>	dale ah.. but profiler captured that bug right?
T 1587499423 18<20dale18>	adgtl: I don't think there is any bug?

T 1587499571 18<20dale18>	adgtl: So I think perhaps you're either experiencing a problem with your build, or else bad interaction between dimmer and some other package(s).  You could bisect your configuration to try and figure it out.
T 1587499596 18<20dale18>	adgtl: But if you don't need dimmer and want to move on, seems like you can now.

T 1587499611 18<20dale18>	adgtl: I would bet the author will not be able to fix the bug because he can't reproduce it, though.

T 1587499669 18<19nikitamog18>	dimmer looks cool. I feel that the modeline suffices but the aesthetic is nice.

T 1587664509 18<25bandali18>	but yeah besides that, i think it's distasteful to recommend or help with nonfree programs that are somehow remotely related to emacs
T 1587664517 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, right
T 1587664527 18<20ober18>	yeah... they had a page about operating systems too, but some how Linus never changed his communications style to conform...

T 1587664649 18<29wgreenhouse18>	bandali: another problem is that that gnu page's rules are different than https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsChannel#toc3

T 1587665134 18<29wgreenhouse18>	bandali: "flying in the face of" is kind of the question. I think the gnu.org page's attitude toward off-topic content "flies in the face of" the emacswiki rules (which are the only rules most of the ops here were ever aware existed for this channel)

T 1587665481 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, i don't think we need to keep #emacs *strictly* emacs-related at all times. hell, even #gnu and #fsf sometimes diverge into drastically off-topic discussions sometimes. in those cases, we gently remind people to try and bring discussion back to topic and perhaps take unrelated discussion to more appropriate places
