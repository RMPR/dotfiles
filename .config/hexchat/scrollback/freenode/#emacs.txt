Like safely running VMs under a non-root user. Without Apparmor/SELinux, any VM getting pwn'd & finding a sandbox escape gets the VM process' rights.

T 1587341827 18<29wgreenhouse18>	Aurora_v_kosmose: in some situations being known is a good defense to being disappeared or smeared
T 1587341844 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	wgreenhouse: Yeah. It's a weird balance. Sometimes being widely known is a protection of its own.
T 1587341866 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	It's taking a chance though.

T 1587341901 18<27grym18>	(which was weisel's point; the difference to him between a martyr and a suicide was intent, not outcome)
T 1587341942 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	The problem with martyr is that it prevents you from doing any further work. Or enjoying the fruit of your own work.
T 1587341948 18<20bpalmer18>	And there's a huge  difference between either martyrdom or suicide, and murder.

T 1587342225 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Both matter though.
T 1587342372 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	grym: Ending up a martyr despite yourself would be a sign of carelessness or bad luck then.
T 1587342522 18<27grym18>	Aurora_v_kosmose: no, it's a question of priorities
T 1587342547 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	I can see how that would work.
T 1587342550 18<28winny18>	is there a way to do multiline isearch regexp?
T 1587342570 18<28winny18>	I see there is a way to explicitally match a newline, but i really don't care where the newline occurs, just want to treat newline the same as any other whitespace
T 1587342587 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	winny: c-q c-j quotes a newline.
T 1587342621 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Ah... nvm, it doesn't seem to work in this case.
T 1587342651 18<28winny18>	i could do a (.|<quoted newline>)* everywhere I need to match anything
T 1587342662 18<28winny18>	hmm, that might just work, though not ideal =)
T 1587342663 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Hm. Works intermitently on my end.

T 1587370051 18<20bpalmer18>	twb: since the 2000s, I think, it's been directed both to run a profit and to fully pay for pensions 30 years in the future (unlike any private pension).

T 1587370073 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I know Auspost (our equivalent) has gone bankrupt 3 times since 2000
T 1587370085 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: each time basically cheating by having e.g. a retail store chain
T 1587370097 18<19twb18>	and using that to offset the losses of the actual important bit
T 1587370112 18<20bpalmer18>	There is a widespread belief that this is aimed at making it go bankrupt so that then it can be privatized somehow.
T 1587370128 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: of course -- asset stripping
T 1587370152 18<19twb18>	Also they tripled the postage a few years ago, and sent a thing out saying basically "99% of post is banks and corporate and spam, so what the fuck do you care?"
T 1587370172 18<19twb18>	Also I think they gave pensioners 100 free stamps a year for life
T 1587370187 18<19twb18>	since pensioners are the only _voters_ who might give a shit
T 1587370192 18<20bpalmer18>	ah, the US raised postage rates a long while back but made a stamp valid for life.
T 1587370240 18<20bpalmer18>	so if you bought $50/worth of stamps in 2008 (say that was 100 stamps at the time), you'll be able to send 100 first class letters.
T 1587370369 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I think here stamps have face value in cents
T 1587370383 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so if you buy a 30c stamp today, it's worth 30c of 2050 money in 2050
T 1587370390 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: i.e. inflation happens
T 1587370425 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: did you know when post was cool, there were as many as 9 separate deliveries per day
T 1587370449 18<20bpalmer18>	I did not know that.
T 1587370458 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: and there was this one guy who single-handedly convinced the government to change things from cash-on-delivery to the modern stamp system
T 1587370463 18<20bpalmer18>	I do know that in the 19th century, upper class British folks could do multiple exchanges in a day
T 1587370475 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: you used to have to pay to receive a letter, but you could refuse and not open it
T 1587370486 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so people worked out you could encode short messages in the recipient name
T 1587370506 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: like "To: Alice 'Mum's Dead' Smith"
T 1587370529 18<19twb18>	And back then (before stamps) it was like $20 to receive a message, instead of $1 to send one
T 1587370545 18<19twb18>	So only super rich people routinely sent post
T 1587370970 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: imagine a world in which you can send mail to anybody you want.
T 1587370993 18<24rudybot18>	bpalmer: I find it hard to imagine that anybody really believes that stuff
T 1587371070 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: you're right. You need to choose the right color envelope and have the proper return address if you want people to open it.

T 1587599328 18<20dale18>	For pdf-tools and Emacs to be non-jagged on macOS, I believe pdf-tools would need to generate rasters of its pages at e.g. 2x resolution, then hand the raster off to the macOS-specific APIs to draw the image, so that macOS can handle drawing it onto a 1.5x/2x/whatever scaled display.

I've been digging through the docs and tried setting org-export-date-timestamp-format by adding %z but that didnt seem to help
T 1587665019 18<24holomorph18>	i think we'll be just fine largely ignoring emacs-devel

T 1587665076 18<25goatish18>	(originally this was for exporting but having them display in emacs too would be great too)
T 1587665077 18<20bpalmer18>	goatish: what command is C-c C-u .   ? In my org that just does an upheading
T 1587665117 18<20bpalmer18>	well, C-c C-u does that.
T 1587665134 18<29wgreenhouse18>	bandali: "flying in the face of" is kind of the question. I think the gnu.org page's attitude toward off-topic content "flies in the face of" the emacswiki rules (which are the only rules most of the ops here were ever aware existed for this channel)
T 1587665134 18<25goatish18>	That's a good question! I tried to do the C-h k but wasn't sure how to return the function for multi keys like that

T 1587665166 18<20bpalmer18>	goatish: C-h k and then start the sequence ; when it stops accepting input, you've reached the command :)
T 1587665168 18<29wgreenhouse18>	there is a direct conflict, is off-topic content in general allowed (with limitations) or not
T 1587665172 18<25goatish18>	I think it's org-time-stamp
T 1587665206 18<27scheming_around18>	This is driving me mad: for some reason, pdf-tools doesn't work correctly when scrolling down using the mouse, but it does work correctly when scrolling up

T 1587665250 18<27scheming_around18>	When scrolling down, the page just scrolls out of the frame and then pdf-tools redisplays that page from the beginning
T 1587665255 18<20bpalmer18>	aha. C-u C-c is different than C-c C-u . C-u is the "universal prefix" -- running it before a command usually changes it in some way
T 1587665279 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, regarding being on/off topic, that gnu.org pages says: Keep it on topic — personal attacks, trolling/baiting or flooding (posting multiple repetitive lines or large amounts of code) of the channel will not be tolerated.

T 1587665481 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, i don't think we need to keep #emacs *strictly* emacs-related at all times. hell, even #gnu and #fsf sometimes diverge into drastically off-topic discussions sometimes. in those cases, we gently remind people to try and bring discussion back to topic and perhaps take unrelated discussion to more appropriate places
T 1587665497 18<27tromey18>	TBH, emacs is normally more off-topic but also perhaps less trolly/irritating than some other chans
T 1587665515 18<27tromey18>	anyway I would be opposed to a major policy change, since IME #emacs works well already

T 1602790443 18<19wasamasa18>	the gravest concern for guilemacs is whether guile as a scheme can shoulder the demands of emacs

T 1602881625 18<20bpalmer18>	It might be better to just always locally bind replace-line to a function; that way elisp's normal semantics/reader apply.
T 1602881644 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: granted, a maplines could be a better idea.  (defun* maplines (fun &optional (buffer (current-buffer))) (let ((result '())) (with-current-buffer buffer (dolines (start end) (push (funcall fun (buffer-substring start end)) result))) result))  (reduce 'max (maplines 'length (current-buffer)) :initial-value 0)  --> 493

T 1602911283 18<20pjb18>	(and a ton of others. I'd have to require a lot of files…)
T 1602911348 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: you don't need to require them if you set the variable absolutely without trying to read it.
T 1602911357 18<20pjb18>	So how we have to require stuff in each buffer where we use a custom variable…
T 1602911369 18<20bpalmer18>	no, only if you try to *read* the variable, when it's not set.
T 1602911374 18<20pjb18>	This wil break a lot of commands.
T 1602911389 18<20pjb18>	It's set, since I customize it in my rc files.
T 1602911400 18<20pjb18>	And also I try to evaluate it in a erc-mode buffer…
T 1602911412 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: is erc-autojoin in the erc-modules list?
T 1602911453 18<20bpalmer18>	but, unless there's some very serious bug, i suspect something is failing to set it and the module is also not being loaded.
T 1602911468 18<20pjb18>	No, I removed it, because I want to autojoin manually…
T 1602911511 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: you need to load the library to have the variables it defines; having it in the erc-modules list has a side effect of loading it as well as activating it.
T 1602911521 18<20pjb18>	So I guess I have to load erc-autojoin, without adding it to erc-modules so that autojoin is not done, but I can access it. Ok. Thanks.
T 1602911569 18<20pjb18>	Let's see if it works.
T 1602912236 18<20pjb18>	Didn't work. Well, after all I don't want to autojoin, so I will use my own variable. There's no reason to use that erc customization variable…
T 1602912341 18<29mplsCorwin18>	I wonder if this is a case for eval-after-load, as in (eval-after-load 'erc-autojoin-mode (setq ...))
T 1602912677 18<20pjb18>	When I try to follow a doc link to C sources of emacs, it asks me for the directory of emacs sources, but I have set source-directory in my rc file. with (setq source-directory (format "/usr/local/src/emacs-%s/src" emacs-version))
T 1602914413 18<26buhman18>	I just started reading LFN and my mind is completely blown away by this black magic: https://gist.github.com/buhman/a856392c5b772564797d8585961d45dc (a lisp-1 interpreter written in lisp-1, with trivial glue to in turn port the interpreter to scheme)
T 1602914882 18<20pjb18>	buhman: don't worry, Dijkstra ever could understand lisp either.  
T 1602914889 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but this xeval is the core of lisp.
T 1602914902 18<20pjb18>	buhman: lisp is defined by an evaluation function written in lisp itself.
T 1602914934 18<20pjb18>	buhman: this means that introspection and reflexivity is built in the core of lisp.
T 1602914955 18<20pjb18>	externally, this shows by the fact that lisp programs are not written as code, but as data.
T 1602914973 18<20pjb18>	buhman: the syntax of sexp, is a syntax for DATA. Symbolic Expressions are data.
T 1602915009 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so this xeval function can take some data, a sexp, that represents a lisp form, some code. But since it's data, it can process it and interpret it.
T 1602915028 18<20pjb18>	buhman: now the thing is that this xeval is expressed as a sexp too in this file!
T 1602915040 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so we need something to bootstrap the system.
T 1602915072 18<26buhman18>	yeah, quite cool there's no parsing involved; xeval is effectivenly being passed a pre-parsed ast.
T 1602915073 18<20pjb18>	buhman: Russel, a student of McCarthy showed that it could be written as a "simple" 7090 assembler program. It was LISP 1.
T 1602915087 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but of course, you can also use a lisp (scheme) to bootstrap it too.
T 1602915089 18<26buhman18>	super excited to read the rest of this, for the bootstrapping stuff too
T 1602915104 18<20pjb18>	buhman: well, it's not exactly an AST, but close enough.
T 1602915136 18<20pjb18>	buhman: there's sometimes some "syntax" inside the sexps, that can be "parsed".
T 1602915163 18<26buhman18>	you mean, if the interpreter implemented macros?
T 1602915175 18<20pjb18>	For example.
T 1602915215 18<20pjb18>	This is because we write data that we need this QUOTE operator, to tell xeval that we have here a sexp literal, instead of a sexp that represents code to be interpreted.
T 1602915265 18<20pjb18>	McCarthy originally planed to have M-expressions for the code.  car([A,B,C]) -> A  instead of (CAR (QUOTE (A B C))).
T 1602915282 18<20pjb18>	Have a look at http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/m-expression/index.html
T 1602915331 18<20pjb18>	This didn't add anything. Using sexps was simplier, and once we have macros (invented in 1964), (and before that there was already fexprs), it locked in the sexps.
T 1602916765 18<29johnjay18>	pjb: but what about that old thing from lisp machines where it used proper names
T 1602916777 18<29johnjay18>	like instead of this-is-a-function it was M-x This Is A Function <RET>
T 1602916788 18<29johnjay18>	i'm sure i saw that in a video demo
T 1602916950 18<29mplsCorwin18>	could be done just with an overlay in M-:, I'd think
T 1602916956 18<29mplsCorwin18>	oops, M-x
T 1602916993 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: this is something you can do in emacs too. (all emacsen I know too).
T 1602917051 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: but indeed, early sexps used the comma to separate atoms, not the space, Hence in my example, car[(A,B,C)] (I interchanged () with []).
T 1602917067 18<20pjb18>	Because it was (ONE SYMBOL,ANOTHER SYMBOL,A THIRD SYMBOL)
T 1602917096 18<20pjb18>	But in the first implementation of LISP, it was already  (ONE-SYMBOL ANOTHER-SYMBOL A-THIRD-SYMBOL)
T 1602917140 18<20pjb18>	I don't know if the possibility to enter commands with spaces in emacsen comes from that, I doubt it. It probably come from the same ergonomic and user-friendly reasons.
T 1602917191 18<20pjb18>	That said if you type a space in M-x it actually just completes the text, and inserts dashes, instead of a space.
T 1602917210 18<20pjb18>	but Zwei and Hemlock explicitely define commands using strings with spaces.
T 1602917219 18<29mplsCorwin18>	I wonder if there's already an option to give "Friendly Caps" and hide the spaces, e.g. with an overlay.

T 1602917776 18<20pjb18>	Oh, I see. 
T 1602917785 18<20pjb18>	Yes, you could do that with compose-region.
