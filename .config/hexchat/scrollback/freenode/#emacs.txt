T 1613240056 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: there's no (list 4 8).  There's a list (4 8). 
T 1613240071 18<25ldlework18>	I thought (list 4 8) creates a quoted list
T 1613240074 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: never.

T 1613240107 18<25ldlework18>	I tried '(4 8) and (quote 4 8) too
T 1613240109 18<20pjb18>	quote returns a _literal_, _immutable_ object. list returns a fresh, mutable object.
T 1613240116 18<20pjb18>	generic-mode-internal calls: (mapc 'funcall '(4 8))
T 1613240192 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: because the last argument to generic-mode-internal is (4 8) instead of being a list of function, as the name of the parameter, function-list, clearly hinted.
T 1613240192 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: so the bug seems to be in thinkscript-mode.
T 1613240214 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: check the source of thinkscript-mode, and how it calls generic-mode-internal.

T 1613240252 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: quote takes a SINGLE (1) argument.
T 1613240259 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: use C-h f to learn more about lisp operators!
T 1613240344 18<25ldlework18>	pjb: don't you remember months ago you helping me write a complex macro. i just haven't touched elisp in a while, forgive me :)

T 1613240410 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: ok, I've seen your url above with the source.
T 1613240433 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: the problem is that the last argument to define-generic-mode is the progn that returns the vsalue of tab-stop-list, which is (4 8).
T 1613240455 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: you should return a list of function instead!
T 1613240512 18<25ldlework18>	indeed
T 1613240525 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: so, if you want your progn to be the body of a function to be called when the mode is activated,  you should wrap it in a: (list (lambda () (set (make-local-variable ‚Ä¶) (setq-local tab-stop-list ‚Ä¶))))
T 1613240546 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: list returns the elements computed by the argument. The first and only argument here is a lambda expression which returns an anonymous function.
T 1613240560 18<20pjb18>	You can skip the progn, since lambda implies an implicit progn.

T 1613252833 18<20pjb18>	sybariten: in emacs you have a bunch of buffers, and some are for editing code, and some can be shells.

T 1613253042 18<26Wafficus18>	Pretty sure that's what causing the weirdness, since the font itself is what I've used literally forever. This makes sense because I used to be very dependent upon ~/.Xresources for tweaking how terminals would look for 'urxvt'

T 1613570252 18<20pjb18>	nij: also, it seems like you misread what he wrote.  The operator is fn, and it returns a list starting with the lit symbol.
T 1613570306 18<20pjb18>	nij: since bel only has the four types: symbols, pairs, characters, and streams, structures need to be made with lists, and to distinguish different types of structures, you need to use a discriminating symbol at the head of the list.
T 1613570387 18<27nij18>	I think that's elegant, because then I can evaluate if to be (lit prim if).
T 1613570420 18<20pjb18>	nij: in emacs lisp you can do that with defstruct using the :type and :named options: (defstruct (color (:type list) (:named t)) red green blue) (make-color :red 3 :green 42 :blue 66) --> (color 3 42 66)
T 1613570421 18<27nij18>	Yeah, it's a hack for its having only 4 fundamental types, but I like it.

T 1613570501 18<20pjb18>	nij: Also, why keep those 4 types? Just lambda is enough, you can build symbols, pairs, characters and streams out of lambda.
T 1613570563 18<20pjb18>	nij: basically what you're observing here, (and with a lot of other lispers from all grades), is somebody lost in the fascination of the lambda-calculus whirlpool.

T 1614004958 18<27flypaper-ultimat18>	chipps: the docs say to use display-line-numbers-type to modify the behaviour before activating the minor mode, and display-line-numbers (which can be gbuffer local) to change behaviour while the mode is active
T 1614004980 18<20bpalmer18>	knarkzel: because you created a single string, and then assigned it everywhere.

T 1614282292 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: when interpreted, each variable has a conceptual flag associated with it about whether it's "special" -- in which case dynamic lookup should be used, or otherwise, lexical lookup should be used.
T 1614282339 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: when a lexical variable would escape its environment, a new 'closure' form is created, capturing the value of the variable at that time.
T 1614282490 18<28krux0218>	so lets say I have a lexcal variables `a` in file `A` and in file B where lexical scoping is not enabled, and a function `foo` tries to used `a`, it will still works when foo is called from A?

T 1614282643 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: no, it will not work; the lexically scoped a in A will only be visible inside its lexical scope. (typically the let where it's bound)

T 1614283252 18<29mplsCorwin18>	If you have a folder full of test programs and you want them all to come up with a given minor mode active, I think you could want to simply turn on the minor mode in a Per-Directory manner: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html
T 1614283268 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: auto-mode-alist maps between filenames and major modes; it's how emacs knows a .c file should be in c-mode and a .pl file should be in prolog-mode

T 1614284575 18<29sachac18>	seabass: OBS can take SendCaptions messages via websocket and include them in the RTMP stream in a way that Twitch and Youtube can understand, so it's probably doable to get captions going through a self-hosted thing too
T 1614284605 18<29sachac18>	seabass: And then a little Emacs Lisp can let someone pick up captions from, say, #emacsconf-accessible or a CRDT buffer, so it's not just one person madly typing all day.
T 1614284637 18<19seabass18>	hmm icecast has no mention of captions
