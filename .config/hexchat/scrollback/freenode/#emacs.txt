T 1585944572 18<28roadie18>	they use waypoint decision making and maybe flanking / groupID like the crysis AI - the scripting is just that they all want to tell the story the player is supposed to see

T 1586549432 18<19wasamasa18>	it turns out the generated setter is a compiler macro to convert the setf form into an aset call with the right index
T 1586549439 18<20lxsameer18>	wasamasa: i'm a bit confused here, setf sets the value of the place to the given value right

T 1586550699 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: But since you were doing (global-display-line-numbers-mode) to turn it on, I thought it was polite to turn it off with a function as well.

T 1586550854 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: FWIW, in your code that was NOT using a hook, you were only executing that (setq) form once, the first time something caused 'shell to be loaded.
T 1586550886 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: And that setq under :config was being run in who-knows-what current buffer.
T 1586550920 18<20dale18>	Doesn't use-package require packages by default?  If so, (use-package shell :config (setq ...)) would run the setq with *scratch* as the current buffer.
T 1586550946 18<25cvandusen18>	It runs :config when the package is loaded. 
T 1586550966 18<20dale18>	Right, but isn't use-package-always-defer nil by default, some variable like that?
T 1586551004 18<20dale18>	Oh, it's more complicated than that, I forgot.
T 1586551121 18<20dale18>	But in this case, I believe tobiasBora originally had just (use-package shell :config (setq...)).  Without one of the other use-package keywords, I believe that means shell will be loaded immediately by use-package.
T 1586551154 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: So I bet your original setq, without a hook, was setting display-line-numbers-mode in *scratch*, at Emacs startup.  (And then the value was killed when *scratch* was probably put into lisp-interaction-mode.)
T 1586551202 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: Now, why your hook with (setq ...) didn't work, that is a mystery.
T 1586551299 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: My first guess is that it works but you made a mistake in testing.  My second guess is that the pre-command-hook I mentioned was left on, and that somehow turns line numbers back on when it runs.

T 1586707748 18<22giorgian18>	work_: It's buffer-local, so you should set it in each buffer. If you want to set it for every file, for instance, you can set (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () setq truncate-lines 1))
T 1586707820 18<22giorgian18>	sorry, that's (add-hook 'find-file-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))

T 1586707871 18<22giorgian18>	that will work for all opened files. 
T 1586707969 18<22giorgian18>	Or you can set it for specific modes adding it to the relevant hook: for text-mode it would be (add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda () (setq truncate-lines 1)))
T 1586709268 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: some texts need truncating with prejudice.

One of things I haven't gotten my head around yet is a feel for where to store data. This time I've opted for a hash table as a "database" that stores all my data, and the buffer is a "view" layer on the top. But it seems to me quite an "emacsy" thing to make the buffer the data store... I'm thinking of how I imagine modes

T 1586734297 18<20dale18>	Profpatsch: You can set debug-on-quit to t (or M-x toggle-debug-on-quit) and then C-g to try and interrupt whatever is blocking, hopefully dropping you into the debugger.
T 1586735655 18<27Profpatsch18>	Hm, sounds like a plan
T 1586736333 18<27scheming_around18>	Is there a method to use use-package with scripts such as this: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColumnMarker
T 1586736735 18<20dale18>	scheming_around: If you download the Elisp (files) and put them on load-path, you can probably just load it normally with use-package.  You could use something like https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package to install them directly from the wiki, I think there are mixed feelings in the community about doing that.
T 1586737191 18<26clmg18>	How can I improve the performance of emacsclient? I don't mean the server, but the actual client frame initialization.
T 1586737243 18<25jamzattack18>	Use --with-x-toolkit=no instead of gtk
T 1586737256 18<26clmg18>	I use terminal emacs
T 1586737297 18<26clmg18>	There's about 1 second between running `emacsclient -nw .` and being able to actually see the dired buffer.
T 1586737304 18<22nikitam18>	I do not envy terminal emacs maybe because I couldn't comforably set it up in gentoo.
T 1586737332 18<22nikitam18>	It made clunking around the OS much easier, though. clmg: what's your window manager?

T 1586737391 18<22nikitam18>	That looks like Mac OS 7
T 1586737422 18<22nikitam18>	It's probably super simple and minimal, I bet.
T 1586737423 18<25jamzattack18>	Looks just like twm
T 1586737440 18<26clmg18>	I love it. It has served me well for ~3 years
T 1586737498 18<22nikitam18>	It says Wind has superceded it, 6 years ago. Any huge difference?
T 1586737549 18<25jamzattack18>	Speaking of, does anyone know a WM that can launch another WM?  twm and ratpoison are the only ones that I know
T 1586737557 18<26clmg18>	I haven't tried wind.
T 1586737567 18<22nikitam18>	xdm?
T 1586737581 18<28technomancy18>	jamzattack: awesome does, I think
T 1586737607 18<26clmg18>	xdm is great
T 1586737664 18<22nikitam18>	I'm sad I had to scrap my gentoo. I learned a lot.
T 1586737689 18<25jamzattack18>	but xdm doesn't let you keep the same programs open, does it?
T 1586737702 18<22nikitam18>	I had to prioritize getting proprietary software to work for school so I had to choose between Redhat and Debian.
T 1586737742 18<22nikitam18>	jamzattack: Not to my knowledge. I think you can just use it alone or delegate the task to another wm.
T 1586737759 18<24rwp18>	jamzattack, Don't you just exit or kill one window manager and then just start another to switch?
T 1586737814 18<24rwp18>	That's the way I have always done it.  With the typical window manager system.  Not with the heavier Desktop Environments.
T 1586737834 18<22nikitam18>	rwp: I wonder how complex it would be to have all your window sessions persist in something heavy.
T 1586737870 18<24rwp18>	What fails to "persist"?
T 1586737909 18<24rwp18>	I mean if I have Firefox open, a dozen xterms, Emacs, and a dozen other random X programs, those all persist, right?
T 1586737913 18<22nikitam18>	Open applications, perhaps. If the processes keep running and one has enough RAM it seems feasible.
T 1586738246 18<25spikemaster18>	ratpoison
T 1586738329 18<22nikitam18>	spikemaster: This looks cool.
T 1586738389 18<25jamzattack18>	Yeah I usually start twm or ratpoison and switch to EXWM, just wondering if there was another floating wm that does this so that I can get back to tty without manually killing Xorg 
T 1586738500 18<22nikitam18>	Don't most systems have a set of getty sessions open on boot?
T 1586738539 18<22nikitam18>	I guess I'm getting my head scrambled between OpenRC and Systemd
T 1586739110 18<26clmg18>	Is there a way to get tint2 to draw without having a wm window?
T 1586739628 18<27grym18>	i just picked up i3
T 1586739631 18<27grym18>	so far so good 
T 1586739974 18<20aidalgol18>	I tried Marathon yesterday.  It has not aged well.
