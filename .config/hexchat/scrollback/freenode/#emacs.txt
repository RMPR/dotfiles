T 1612208149 18<20dale18>	ckx: I will advise that Emacs, at least on macOS, will pick a different font sometimes if the default font doesn't have certain glyphs.
T 1612208184 18<20dale18>	ckx: More precisely, if it needs to render a glyph, and the font for that particular glyph doesn't actually have the glyph, macOS may choose to have Emacs use a different font.

T 1612208308 18<22ckx18>	dale: that's interesting. I'd think that emacs would try and find a fallback font itself (or just a compiled-in font), not that the OS would serve it an alternative.
T 1612208337 18<20dale18>	ckx: I think this has to do because Emacs tries to delegate text rendering to macOS's CoreText, and that's just how the API works, or at least the work has not been put in on Emacs to make it behave otherwise, but we're pretty far outside my personal experience so I could be wrong.

T 1612213658 18<20kuba-orlik18>	Hi there! I used to use this snippet to configure my mu4e accounts, but recently it stopped working. It seems that `let` no longer keeps the value available for later calls? Here's the snippet:
T 1612213658 18<20kuba-orlik18>	https://hub.sealcode.org/P18
T 1612213659 18<20kuba-orlik18>	I'd be thankful for lispy guidance :)

T 1612213838 18<20kuba-orlik18>	but when it's initializing, it properly prints '!!! addresses' followed by the correct value
T 1612214053 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: If you get this error, it means that this let made dynamic bindings.  Dynamic = WHEN; lexical = WHERE.
T 1612214071 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: nowadays, emacs is able to do lexical bindings, and has closures. 
T 1612214101 18<20kuba-orlik18>	I see - but this used to work for years now, did something in the behavior of `let` change recently?
T 1612214102 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: you should activate it with a (setq lexical-binding t) at the start of your source.
T 1612214148 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: I think it's the change in behavior of lambda that hits you here.
T 1612214192 18<20kuba-orlik18>	I added (setq lexical-binding t) and the issue persists
T 1612214200 18<20kuba-orlik18>	what changed in the behavior of lambda?
T 1612214206 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: but even with purely dynamic bindings, it shouldn't have worked, because let would have made dynamic bindings that would be supressed AFTER let is completed.
T 1612214213 18<20pjb18>	Your code was already buggy.
T 1612214225 18<20pjb18>	now lambda can return closures.
T 1612214232 18<20pjb18>	This goes hand-in-hand with lexical binding.
T 1612214295 18<20kuba-orlik18>	I see... so what would be the correct approach?

T 1612214390 18<20pjb18>	Two ways: https://termbin.com/h2nr
T 1612214430 18<20pjb18>	Either use global dynamic variables, (but then you can have only one context active at a time), or use local lexical variables (then you can have several contextes, each enclosed in their own closures).
T 1612214461 18<20pjb18>	Since you started with a kuba/generate-mu4-context I'd advise the lexical-binding way.
T 1612214475 18<20pjb18>	Just add (setf lexical-binding t) to your source.

T 1612214640 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: the bug in your code was that with dynamic binding let creates a variable named addresses. Then it makes a mu4e-context, with a lambda that uses the dynamic variable named addresses. Then the let destroys the dynamic variable named addresses.  Then later you will call the lambda, and there will be no dynamic variable named addresses.
T 1612214652 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: the solution would be to define such a global variable with (defvar addresses).
T 1612214668 18<20pjb18>	But then you would have to assign it with setf instead of using let (which creates a new variable).
T 1612214676 18<20pjb18>	cf the first way in teh above url.
T 1612214698 18<24npostavs18>	pjb: the correct way to set lexical binding for elisp is putting -*- lexical-binding: t -*- on the first line of the file (you also have to setf if you want it respected immediately by C-M-x and friends)
T 1612214701 18<24deego18>	kuba-orlik: in the older days, one would do things like `(lambda (...)   ...   ,addresses ...) which you can still do, ofc
T 1612214710 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: if your code worked before, it was because some other code had created this global variable named addresses. But your let didn't modify it.

T 1612972940 18<22zmagii18>	It doesn't?
T 1612972942 18<27grym18>	no
T 1612972948 18<27grym18>	it's a .NET java killer
T 1612972966 18<27grym18>	you can tell: i can write c# without hating myself; C makes me insane 
T 1612973075 18<22zmagii18>	The thing that really gripes me is actually something else, which is that MS grants legitimacy to things by appeal to authority. "We don't experience this issue with any of our other partners, perhaps the issue is on your side [sell your soul to MS, and die], have a nice day, Sir."
T 1612973155 18<22zmagii18>	So, C# is not bad?
T 1612973167 18<27grym18>	as a language i enjoy it the most of its kind 
T 1612973189 18<27grym18>	obligate-OO, lots of braces, everything has to be a class, etc.  languages
T 1612973229 18<27hodapp18>	part of why I hated C++ is because for a long while C++ was pretty much just that, on top of a language that felt like someone tried to put a candy shell over C
T 1612973248 18<27hodapp18>	"Look, it's just as good as any other high level la... Segmentation fault (core dumped)"
T 1612973252 18<27grym18>	is it petty that i don't like c++ because of all this :: nonsense and it just looks like line noise to me 
T 1612973283 18<27hodapp18>	namespacing bothers me the least I gueess
T 1612973371 18<27grym18>	also i can pretty routinely find memory leaks and segfaults and stuff in our core c++ codebase by wrapping it in python and poking at it 
T 1612973378 18<27grym18>	and this does not really instill confidence
T 1612973650 18<22zmagii18>	What do you mean "by wrapping it in Python"?

T 1612973779 18<27grym18>	they're good enough to have shipped a bunch, which is kind of fun 
T 1612973961 18<19rpav18>	grym: ergh, sounds like something needs a rewrite
T 1612974151 18<22zmagii18>	Hmm, SWIG.
T 1612974194 18<19rpav18>	swig is so terrible i spent a few months writing something to replace it once, and it wasn't even hard ;/
T 1612974234 18<22zmagii18>	I don't really understand the wiki or the website where they explain what SWIG is.
T 1612974238 18<19rpav18>	(to be fair, clang wasn't around in the early swig days, and my code clearly didn't do any of the heavy lifting ;)
T 1612974261 18<19rpav18>	zmagii: SWIG looks at headers and generates definitions you can use for language wrappers
T 1612974272 18<19rpav18>	it does so rather poorly, because it's not a complete parser
T 1612974297 18<19rpav18>	and also rather than generating a useful medium, tends to rely on plugins that generate target-language code
T 1612974298 18<22zmagii18>	So it's like an sort of time saving tool if you want to write a wrapper to something.
T 1612974303 18<19rpav18>	basically
T 1612974332 18<22zmagii18>	Luckily I don't do that.
T 1612974340 18<19rpav18>	but (shameless plug) https://github.com/rpav/c2ffi is a better solutin imnsho ;)
T 1612974381 18<19rpav18>	yeah you typically don't need to unless you're a library author in a multi-language facility, or you're doing something probably you could avoid by picking better tools
T 1612974444 18<22zmagii18>	In my mind APIs are interacting software, but I guess wrappers are more of a practical necessity. Kind of like that XKCD about standards.
T 1612974472 18<19rpav18>	well, it *is* a bit silly to rewrite a bunch of stuff when you could access a well-tested library to do so
T 1612974478 18<22zmagii18>	In my world this would be the fact that R lang uses a lot of C code.
T 1612974489 18<19rpav18>	and FFI is a lot nicer than a language-side wrapper
T 1612974492 18<22zmagii18>	Or Python, for that matter. And then Julia was invented to "solve" this.
T 1612974546 18<27hodapp18>	the hard+soft pattern has a long history and there is a famous paper from when people started to note this: https://www.tcl.tk/doc/scripting.html
T 1612974587 18<19rpav18>	oh man i was just thinking of tcl/tk last night
T 1612974593 18<27hodapp18>	on purpose?!
T 1612974627 18<22zmagii18>	FFI would be rpy2 which yes, you are correct, works pretty well.
T 1612974631 18<19rpav18>	i liked those :( and itcl/itk
T 1612974660 18<19rpav18>	i vaguely recall writing some thing back when .. but i don't remember what. still have the ousterhout book on the shelf too.
T 1612974712 18<19rpav18>	i mean consider the kind of gui you could whip out and with what ease in the mid-90s with tcl/tk .. alternatives then were like, VB
T 1612974760 18<27grym18>	rpav: i've been trying to get people to switch to cpppy or something similar, but that's someone else's team 
T 1612974772 18<27grym18>	not my circus, not my monkeys, gimmie *.so and we'll call it good
T 1612974779 18<19rpav18>	grym: it doesn't sound like the python end is the real problem though ;/
T 1612974786 18<27grym18>	rpav: it isn't :) 
T 1612974786 18<19rpav18>	heh yeah
T 1612974810 18<27grym18>	rpav: did you see that dabeaz found videotape of his probably first swig talk 
T 1612974826 18<19rpav18>	nah
T 1612974838 18<27grym18>	if you want to see him in his PFY grad student years https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5f9-Y3Wtbc 
T 1612974846 18<19rpav18>	swig was definitely pretty neat back in the day, even if it wasn't perfect
T 1612974855 18<19rpav18>	cool
T 1612974862 18<27grym18>	sure, it was cooked up by a half-crazed physics grad student
T 1612974871 18<27grym18>	this is about what you'd expect to get :P
T 1612974880 18<27hodapp18>	it is arguably better than OpenCV's half-assed ad-hoc binding system
T 1612974888 18<19rpav18>	it was a solution that was more-working than other options, what can you do 
T 1612974904 18<27grym18>	openCV defines a lot of things 
T 1612974908 18<19rpav18>	though if gcc had been implemented with an accessible API early on .. ;P
T 1612974909 18<27grym18>	most of them are ... bad things 
T 1612974941 18<27hodapp18>	yeah, unfortunately OpenCV is one of the only libraries in existence for a lot of tasks
T 1612974951 18<27hodapp18>	and almost always the fastest
T 1612974988 18<27grym18>	doesn't mean i don't want to cause physical harm to their documentation/bindings team with sufficient application of a banana pudding though 
T 1612975021 18<27grym18>	at least they finally ship wheels
T 1612975049 18<22zmagii18>	Tcl was a scripting language?
T 1612975060 18<27hodapp18>	yes
T 1612975075 18<27grym18>	inasmuch as that is a distinction that has a difference

T 1612975758 18<22zmagii18>	Oh. Well, you can build up sets from the empty set.
T 1612975774 18<27grym18>	that won't help us at all :) 
T 1612975788 18<22zmagii18>	Why not? All of mathematics is modelled by set theory.
T 1612975816 18<27grym18>	that was the dream, anyway

T 1612975829 18<22zmagii18>	You mean, set theory was the dream?
T 1612975857 18<22zmagii18>	It kind of still is. Toposes are just the same as sets but a bit more, ehm, arrow-y.
T 1612975897 18<22zmagii18>	There is the whole consistency thing, but it didn't stop people from still running with the, er, dream.
T 1612975897 18<27grym18>	i'm merely pointing out that russell and whitehead bit off more than they could chew and the history of mathematics for the first half of the 20th century is roughly summarised as "oh, goddammit."
T 1612975909 18<22jamik18>	IMO life is simple and infinitely complex at the same time. The only thing(s) that are "real" are what you are experiencing right now - all else is a memory or an idea which is still being experienced now. This doesn't say anything about whether the nature of the universe is stateful or consistent though. Maybe it is, maybe not
T 1612975925 18<22zmagii18>	I personally like the outcome of that era, but that may be a personality thing.

T 1612976075 18<22zmagii18>	I always thought it was just an analogy, but that time cone is the result of an algebraic structure with (t,x,y,z) or t + ai + bj + ck where i^=-1, j^2=1, k^=1.

Banks are supposed to be able to source "new money" when issuing loans for money that they don't have in deposits.

So, once you open two buffers side by side, the active buffer has a different mini buffer background colour, which is only comfortable way to visually get which buffer is active (cause searching for the flashing cursor is too hard).

T 1613240071 18<25ldlework18>	I thought (list 4 8) creates a quoted list
T 1613240074 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: never.

T 1613240109 18<20pjb18>	quote returns a _literal_, _immutable_ object. list returns a fresh, mutable object.
T 1613240116 18<20pjb18>	generic-mode-internal calls: (mapc 'funcall '(4 8))
T 1613240192 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: because the last argument to generic-mode-internal is (4 8) instead of being a list of function, as the name of the parameter, function-list, clearly hinted.
T 1613240192 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: so the bug seems to be in thinkscript-mode.
T 1613240214 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: check the source of thinkscript-mode, and how it calls generic-mode-internal.

T 1613240252 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: quote takes a SINGLE (1) argument.

T 1613240344 18<25ldlework18>	pjb: don't you remember months ago you helping me write a complex macro. i just haven't touched elisp in a while, forgive me :)

T 1613240410 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: ok, I've seen your url above with the source.
T 1613240433 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: the problem is that the last argument to define-generic-mode is the progn that returns the vsalue of tab-stop-list, which is (4 8).
T 1613240455 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: you should return a list of function instead!
T 1613240512 18<25ldlework18>	indeed
T 1613240525 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: so, if you want your progn to be the body of a function to be called when the mode is activated,  you should wrap it in a: (list (lambda () (set (make-local-variable …) (setq-local tab-stop-list …))))
T 1613240546 18<20pjb18>	ldlework: list returns the elements computed by the argument. The first and only argument here is a lambda expression which returns an anonymous function.
T 1613240560 18<20pjb18>	You can skip the progn, since lambda implies an implicit progn.

T 1613570252 18<20pjb18>	nij: also, it seems like you misread what he wrote.  The operator is fn, and it returns a list starting with the lit symbol.
T 1613570306 18<20pjb18>	nij: since bel only has the four types: symbols, pairs, characters, and streams, structures need to be made with lists, and to distinguish different types of structures, you need to use a discriminating symbol at the head of the list.
T 1613570387 18<27nij18>	I think that's elegant, because then I can evaluate if to be (lit prim if).
T 1613570420 18<20pjb18>	nij: in emacs lisp you can do that with defstruct using the :type and :named options: (defstruct (color (:type list) (:named t)) red green blue) (make-color :red 3 :green 42 :blue 66) --> (color 3 42 66)
T 1613570421 18<27nij18>	Yeah, it's a hack for its having only 4 fundamental types, but I like it.
T 1613570451 18<20pjb18>	nij: but in practice it's useless. For real programs,  you would just use Common Lisp.

T 1613570501 18<20pjb18>	nij: Also, why keep those 4 types? Just lambda is enough, you can build symbols, pairs, characters and streams out of lambda.
T 1613570563 18<20pjb18>	nij: basically what you're observing here, (and with a lot of other lispers from all grades), is somebody lost in the fascination of the lambda-calculus whirlpool.

T 1613570604 18<27nij18>	pjb: Yeah, I think he knows its impracticality and just treats that as an exercise of his.
T 1613570614 18<20pjb18>	There is no meaningful set of "primitive" operations or types.  There's lambda-calculus, and you can build everything from there.
