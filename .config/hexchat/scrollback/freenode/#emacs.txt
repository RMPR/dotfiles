T 1602788117 18<24laertus18>	anyway, i'm kind of a greybeard myself... i can take it
T 1602788144 18<19wasamasa18>	yes, there's an emacs-devel discussion of aliasing a different command to it for feedback in general
T 1602788159 18<19wasamasa18>	and making the system details optional for that case
T 1602788295 18<24laertus18>	i was just reading through the cl-defstruct docs, and read this:
T 1602788301 18<24laertus18>	"‘:print-function’ In full Common Lisp, this option allows you to specify a function that is called to print an instance of the structure type.  The Emacs Lisp system offers no hooks into the Lisp printer which would allow for such a feature, so this package simply ignores ‘:print-function’."
T 1602788322 18<24laertus18>	so i was thinking: why not allow hooks in to the elisp printer?
T 1602788356 18<24laertus18>	and i've come across a bunch of other similar statements in the cl package about stuff that elisp doesn't have that makes the package be unable to implement useful stuff
T 1602788357 18<20pjb18>	laertus: history?
T 1602788369 18<24laertus18>	ok, history for the past
T 1602788380 18<24laertus18>	but the future need not be limited by the past
T 1602788398 18<19wasamasa18>	have you looked at print.c?
T 1602788408 18<20pjb18>	laertus: the history of RMS not liking Common Lisp, and also the fact that the Common Lisp standardization process (started 1984, completed 1996) was parallel to the creation of GNU emacs (started developpement in 1983).
T 1602788415 18<19wasamasa18>	granted, it's half the code of lread.c, but still
T 1602788420 18<24laertus18>	wasamasa: no, but i've looked at emacs c code before, and it ain't pretty

T 1602788439 18<20pjb18>	laertus: oh and yes, the fact that half of emacs is written in C instead of lisp. That doesn't help maintainance and improvements…
T 1602788459 18<24laertus18>	pjb: well, does scheme have hooks in to its printer and other features that would allow implementing some of these cl features?  i'd bet yes

T 1602788524 18<24laertus18>	anyway, there has to be a better reason for not moving forward with a feature than "RMS doesn't like it"
T 1602788547 18<20johnw18>	well, sometimes that IS the reason
T 1602788548 18<19wasamasa18>	CHICKEN has extensions for reader macros, but printing?
T 1602788558 18<24laertus18>	i don't want to make elisp in to common lisp... but i don't see why supporting useful features should be outlawed just because cl has them
T 1602788566 18<19wasamasa18>	might as well be "RMS doesn't see a priority there"
T 1602788568 18<20pjb18>	laertus: well, there is. The weight of third party emacs lisp packages.
T 1602788570 18<20johnw18>	what has been outlawed because CL has it?
T 1602788610 18<24laertus18>	pjb: how would third party emacs lisp packages be affected by having an extra feature in elisp?  they don't have to use that feature or even be aware of it
T 1602788628 18<20edgar-rft18>	laertus: most often the reason is just simply that it requires a huge amount of work to rewrite the Emacs internals to support a specific feature
T 1602788629 18<20pjb18>	laertus: even if we rewrote emacs in CL (it has been done, several times), you still have to provide an emacs lisp in CL (it has been done too), to be able to run third party packages, and you have to implement the whole emacs lisp library too with this emacs lisp API.
T 1602788643 18<20pjb18>	laertus: see hemlock.
T 1602788662 18<24laertus18>	again, i'm not proposing that emacs be written in cl, nor that elisp be turned in to cl

T 1602788917 18<19wasamasa18>	I know of a few people that use CHICKEN for interactive hacking, but the intended mode of operation is batch compilation really and it's pretty nice for that (though compilation speed is terrible)

T 1602788956 18<19wasamasa18>	guile has a better interactive development story, though the bugs people report on #scheme are terrifying

T 1602789156 18<19wasamasa18>	I've reread The Pervert's Guide To Computer Programming and it claims at some point scheme happened when lisp had a hysterical moment
T 1602789162 18<24laertus18>	the thing is that elisp is widely acknowledge to be really slow compared to cl and modern schemes
T 1602789173 18<24laertus18>	unlike cl vs scheme

I have to assume any other approach would involve very aggressively upstreaming changes to guile jit as that seems to be what's happening with Emacs and GCC.

T 1602790443 18<19wasamasa18>	the gravest concern for guilemacs is whether guile as a scheme can shoulder the demands of emacs

T 1602911511 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: you need to load the library to have the variables it defines; having it in the erc-modules list has a side effect of loading it as well as activating it.

T 1602914889 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but this xeval is the core of lisp.
T 1602914902 18<20pjb18>	buhman: lisp is defined by an evaluation function written in lisp itself.
T 1602914934 18<20pjb18>	buhman: this means that introspection and reflexivity is built in the core of lisp.
T 1602914955 18<20pjb18>	externally, this shows by the fact that lisp programs are not written as code, but as data.
T 1602914973 18<20pjb18>	buhman: the syntax of sexp, is a syntax for DATA. Symbolic Expressions are data.
T 1602915009 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so this xeval function can take some data, a sexp, that represents a lisp form, some code. But since it's data, it can process it and interpret it.
T 1602915028 18<20pjb18>	buhman: now the thing is that this xeval is expressed as a sexp too in this file!
T 1602915040 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so we need something to bootstrap the system.
T 1602915072 18<26buhman18>	yeah, quite cool there's no parsing involved; xeval is effectivenly being passed a pre-parsed ast.
T 1602915073 18<20pjb18>	buhman: Russel, a student of McCarthy showed that it could be written as a "simple" 7090 assembler program. It was LISP 1.
T 1602915087 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but of course, you can also use a lisp (scheme) to bootstrap it too.

T 1602915104 18<20pjb18>	buhman: well, it's not exactly an AST, but close enough.
T 1602915136 18<20pjb18>	buhman: there's sometimes some "syntax" inside the sexps, that can be "parsed".
T 1602915163 18<26buhman18>	you mean, if the interpreter implemented macros?
T 1602915175 18<20pjb18>	For example.
T 1602915215 18<20pjb18>	This is because we write data that we need this QUOTE operator, to tell xeval that we have here a sexp literal, instead of a sexp that represents code to be interpreted.
T 1602915265 18<20pjb18>	McCarthy originally planed to have M-expressions for the code.  car([A,B,C]) -> A  instead of (CAR (QUOTE (A B C))).
T 1602915282 18<20pjb18>	Have a look at http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/m-expression/index.html
T 1602915331 18<20pjb18>	This didn't add anything. Using sexps was simplier, and once we have macros (invented in 1964), (and before that there was already fexprs), it locked in the sexps.

T 1602917051 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: but indeed, early sexps used the comma to separate atoms, not the space, Hence in my example, car[(A,B,C)] (I interchanged () with []).
T 1602917067 18<20pjb18>	Because it was (ONE SYMBOL,ANOTHER SYMBOL,A THIRD SYMBOL)
T 1602917096 18<20pjb18>	But in the first implementation of LISP, it was already  (ONE-SYMBOL ANOTHER-SYMBOL A-THIRD-SYMBOL)

T 1603199358 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: but otherwise, you have two variables holding indent functions: indent-line-function and indent-region-function.
T 1603199367 18<20pjb18>	that's because of your parentheses!
T 1603199374 18<20pjb18>	Use defun if you want less indentation.
T 1603199398 18<20pjb18>	so you should look at the functions stored in those variables, and see their documentation and how they can be customized.
T 1603199411 18<20_maddy18>	I don't have defun, this is my own custom lisp language :)
T 1603199412 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: alternatively, you can write your own indenting function and store it in those varibles.
T 1603199538 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: the standard lisp-indent-region calls lisp-indent-line (directly, not thru the variable).
T 1603199650 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: if you use those functions eventually lisp-indent-function is called, and it uses properties set to the operator symbol to compute the indentation.
T 1603199682 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: so you could configure a lisp-indent-function property on fn, to ensure a negative indentation.
T 1603199693 18<25OlCe18>	_maddy: Hi. You could use 'indent' declarations for your macros.
T 1603199730 18<20_maddy18>	here is something simple I tried https://paste.rs/BRB with the idea of just increasing the indentation by 2 from previous line, but I get error: indent-line-to: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, nil
T 1603199744 18<20pjb18>	_maddy:  you would have to put your own function here! Because the other options implemented by lisp-indent-function always indent positively.
T 1603199744 18<25OlCe18>	_maddy: You can lookup '(elisp)Declare Form'.
T 1603199824 18<25OlCe18>	_maddy: As you'll see, you can have your own function called by 'lisp-indent-function' for your macros only.

T 1604707949 18<20dale18>	frdg: I'm reading prolog.el.  Turns out that it uses font-lock-builtin-face if that face is defined, or prolog-builtin-face otherwise.

T 1604707998 18<26frdg18>	dale: so if I undefine these font-lcok faces things should work?
T 1604708003 18<20dale18>	frdg: So prolog.el defines the face and then promptly doesn't use it, at least not on any remotely recent Emacs I think.  (Maybe XEmacs is still different or something.)  Solution there may be to just (setq prolog-builtin-face 'prolog-builtin-face) to get prolog-mode to use prolog-builtin-face.
T 1604708016 18<25jamzattack18>	dale, frdg: fwiw prolog-builtin-face is obsolete in 28

T 1604708125 18<20dale18>	Viking667: master just says that in preparation for the day in the (not near AFAIK) future when 28 will be released.
T 1604708148 18<26Viking66718>	I compiled yesterday from master, I get GNU Emacs 28.0.50 (build 1...) from that
T 1604708151 18<26frdg18>	ok this is problematic because I am using another language that I guess also uses `font-lock-builtin-face` though the emacs mode for it was built off of the prolog-mode from what I understand.

T 1604708215 18<26frdg18>	yes I will work through it  now that I understand the problem.
T 1604708223 18<20dale18>	frdg: So https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/2968 suggests you can set a buffer-local value for the *variable* font-lock-builtin-face to point to another face.
T 1604708234 18<19parsnip18>	like, if modes are mostly indentation and syntax highlighting, they are also pretty easy to modify there, i expect.
T 1604708257 18<20dale18>	frdg: I have never tried this, but perhaps if you customize prolog-builtin-face and then (setq-local font-lock-builtin-face 'prolog-builtin-face) in a function you place in prolog-mode-hook, this might work.
T 1604708273 18<26frdg18>	ok I will try this
T 1604708278 18<20dale18>	frdg: (As jamzattack said, prolog-builtin-face will apparently go away at some point in the future, but you can at least see if it works for you for now and worry about the future in the future.)

T 1604708306 18<24SpiderPig18>	Is splitting up a config into early-init.el necesary or is it simply a performance boost?
T 1604708328 18<19parsnip18>	why not just make font-lock-function-face buffer local?
T 1604708358 18<20dale18>	parsnip: You can modify font-lock-defaults or font-lock-keywords or whatever in a mode hook, I expect, but font-lock-keywords often has a very complex value, IMHO, and gets hard to modify.  Maybe there are better ways.
T 1604708374 18<24holomorph18>	SpiderPig: it was a compromise/workaround for dealing with how packages are loaded
T 1604708431 18<20dale18>	parsnip: I think that's what I suggested.  Though note that you can't make a *face* buffer local, AFAIK.  I *think* faces are stored either in symbol properties or else somewhere in some C construct, they're not just in a symbol's value slot AFAIK.

T 1604708545 18<24SpiderPig18>	holomorph: I guess I thought it would be aplicable because somewhere I read it is called before package-initialize which is called before init.el
T 1604708563 18<20dale18>	parsnip: From reading this it sounds to me like that will change the face for just one buffer rather than for all buffers in a given major mode, but you could be right.

T 1611770859 18<22srid18>	I don't think you can use `global-set-key`
T 1611770873 18<22srid18>	Because I want the keybinding to be local to the derived mode
T 1611770983 18<22srid18>	I tried `local-set-key` but doesn't work at all.
T 1611771039 18<20dale18>	srid: If you're deriving a mode, then you probably want to make a new keymap for that derived mode, and set that up as the local map.  You can make the derived mode's keymap inherit from markdown-mode's keymap.

T 1611771139 18<20dale18>	srid: I *think* gfm-mode is a major mode derived from markdown-mode.  (gfm = GitHub-flavored Markdown)

T 1611771202 18<20dale18>	seabass: define-key.  The Elisp function must start with (interactive).  If it doesn't then you should modify it or wrap it.
