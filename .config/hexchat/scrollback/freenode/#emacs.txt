T 1586532938 18<29mplsCorwin18>	My $.02. I'd probably just go with seperate org docs for each product, or maybe sections, and writing my own queries with org-ql or some such.  Nothing wrong with an RDBMS here, but probably overkill and having narratives around each product that you don't have think about data-modeling for may be more useful vs faster queries you don't have to plumb.

T 1586533109 18<29mplsCorwin18>	there's a gnu project that has some emacs support for flat-file DB.  I forget the name but it handles relationships and semi structured data pretty reasonably and has query semantics already developed.

T 1586533652 18<29mplsCorwin18>	Something is going to have to compare the sets, I guess.  If you use an RDBMS (even recutil) the DB is that thing.  If you roll something in emacs then you'll need to write that function, including sourcing the data, performing the calculations/comparisons, and doing the right thing with the output (show a buffer, make a file), etc.

T 1586549432 18<19wasamasa18>	it turns out the generated setter is a compiler macro to convert the setf form into an aset call with the right index
T 1586549439 18<20lxsameer18>	wasamasa: i'm a bit confused here, setf sets the value of the place to the given value right

T 1586549513 18<20lxsameer18>	wasamasa: ahhh, so basically (cl-defstruct person name) with create an accessor person-name which using setf
T 1586549523 18<19wasamasa18>	for most stuff it's a trivial translation, like car -> setcar
T 1586549525 18<20lxsameer18>	it would be like (setf (person-name p) asdasd)
T 1586549555 18<19wasamasa18>	but in this case (person-name p) is turned into (aset p ...)

T 1586549606 18<20lxsameer18>	wasamasa: thanks a lot 
T 1586549650 18<19wasamasa18>	which means that unlike with the car -> setcar example, one cannot cleverly avoid the use of setf and would need to count slots instead

T 1586550663 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: The only extra thing I see it doing is removing a pre-command-hook.  Maybe that's important.

T 1586550699 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: But since you were doing (global-display-line-numbers-mode) to turn it on, I thought it was polite to turn it off with a function as well.

T 1586550848 18<25tobiasBora18>	how, you mean that the global hook sets the variable, but then the minor mode display-line resets it?
T 1586550854 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: FWIW, in your code that was NOT using a hook, you were only executing that (setq) form once, the first time something caused 'shell to be loaded.
T 1586550886 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: And that setq under :config was being run in who-knows-what current buffer.
T 1586550920 18<20dale18>	Doesn't use-package require packages by default?  If so, (use-package shell :config (setq ...)) would run the setq with *scratch* as the current buffer.
T 1586550946 18<25cvandusen18>	It runs :config when the package is loaded. 
T 1586550966 18<20dale18>	Right, but isn't use-package-always-defer nil by default, some variable like that?
T 1586551004 18<20dale18>	Oh, it's more complicated than that, I forgot.
T 1586551121 18<20dale18>	But in this case, I believe tobiasBora originally had just (use-package shell :config (setq...)).  Without one of the other use-package keywords, I believe that means shell will be loaded immediately by use-package.
T 1586551154 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: So I bet your original setq, without a hook, was setting display-line-numbers-mode in *scratch*, at Emacs startup.  (And then the value was killed when *scratch* was probably put into lisp-interaction-mode.)
T 1586551202 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: Now, why your hook with (setq ...) didn't work, that is a mystery.
T 1586551299 18<20dale18>	tobiasBora: My first guess is that it works but you made a mistake in testing.  My second guess is that the pre-command-hook I mentioned was left on, and that somehow turns line numbers back on when it runs.

T 1586718437 18<25M4rkD18>	Thanks for the insight bpalmer! As a bit of a mode writing newbie, I'm still trying to get a feel for it. One of things I haven't gotten my head around yet is a feel for where to store data. This time I've opted for a hash table as a "database" that stores all my data, and the buffer is a "view" layer on the top. But it seems to me quite an "emacsy" thing to make the buffer the data store... I'm thinking of how I imagine modes
T 1586718437 18<25M4rkD18>	writable grep might work. Is it encouraged to try and follow the "data as plain text in a buffer when possible" approach...? Maybe I'm reading too much into it? :)
T 1586718495 18<20bpalmer18>	I think data as plain text in buffer is definitely a tradition in emacs
T 1586718551 18<20bpalmer18>	although it causes pain if, for example, you don't take care to make the buffer read-only and manually inhibit readonlyness while the mode itself controls all writes to the buffer

Like safely running VMs under a non-root user. Without Apparmor/SELinux, any VM getting pwn'd & finding a sandbox escape gets the VM process' rights.

T 1587453621 18<26lockywolf18>	I mean, binding is important at the moment of application, where is determines which objects are visible to the function body. I can easily imagine (define) defining functions that have access to the definition environment, (defun) to define ones that access runtime-environment objects, and, say (defpure) for functions that only have access to opencoded primitives.
