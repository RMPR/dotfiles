Like safely running VMs under a non-root user. Without Apparmor/SELinux, any VM getting pwn'd & finding a sandbox escape gets the VM process' rights.

T 1587341827 18<29wgreenhouse18>	Aurora_v_kosmose: in some situations being known is a good defense to being disappeared or smeared
T 1587341844 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	wgreenhouse: Yeah. It's a weird balance. Sometimes being widely known is a protection of its own.
T 1587341866 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	It's taking a chance though.

T 1587341901 18<27grym18>	(which was weisel's point; the difference to him between a martyr and a suicide was intent, not outcome)
T 1587341942 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	The problem with martyr is that it prevents you from doing any further work. Or enjoying the fruit of your own work.
T 1587341948 18<20bpalmer18>	And there's a huge  difference between either martyrdom or suicide, and murder.

T 1587342225 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Both matter though.
T 1587342372 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	grym: Ending up a martyr despite yourself would be a sign of carelessness or bad luck then.
T 1587342522 18<27grym18>	Aurora_v_kosmose: no, it's a question of priorities
T 1587342547 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	I can see how that would work.
T 1587342550 18<28winny18>	is there a way to do multiline isearch regexp?
T 1587342570 18<28winny18>	I see there is a way to explicitally match a newline, but i really don't care where the newline occurs, just want to treat newline the same as any other whitespace
T 1587342587 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	winny: c-q c-j quotes a newline.
T 1587342621 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Ah... nvm, it doesn't seem to work in this case.
T 1587342651 18<28winny18>	i could do a (.|<quoted newline>)* everywhere I need to match anything
T 1587342662 18<28winny18>	hmm, that might just work, though not ideal =)
T 1587342663 18<24Aurora_v_kosmose18>	Hm. Works intermitently on my end.

T 1587370051 18<20bpalmer18>	twb: since the 2000s, I think, it's been directed both to run a profit and to fully pay for pensions 30 years in the future (unlike any private pension).

T 1587370073 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I know Auspost (our equivalent) has gone bankrupt 3 times since 2000
T 1587370085 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: each time basically cheating by having e.g. a retail store chain
T 1587370097 18<19twb18>	and using that to offset the losses of the actual important bit
T 1587370112 18<20bpalmer18>	There is a widespread belief that this is aimed at making it go bankrupt so that then it can be privatized somehow.
T 1587370128 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: of course -- asset stripping
T 1587370152 18<19twb18>	Also they tripled the postage a few years ago, and sent a thing out saying basically "99% of post is banks and corporate and spam, so what the fuck do you care?"
T 1587370172 18<19twb18>	Also I think they gave pensioners 100 free stamps a year for life
T 1587370187 18<19twb18>	since pensioners are the only _voters_ who might give a shit
T 1587370192 18<20bpalmer18>	ah, the US raised postage rates a long while back but made a stamp valid for life.
T 1587370240 18<20bpalmer18>	so if you bought $50/worth of stamps in 2008 (say that was 100 stamps at the time), you'll be able to send 100 first class letters.
T 1587370369 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: I think here stamps have face value in cents
T 1587370383 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so if you buy a 30c stamp today, it's worth 30c of 2050 money in 2050
T 1587370390 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: i.e. inflation happens
T 1587370425 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: did you know when post was cool, there were as many as 9 separate deliveries per day
T 1587370449 18<20bpalmer18>	I did not know that.
T 1587370458 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: and there was this one guy who single-handedly convinced the government to change things from cash-on-delivery to the modern stamp system
T 1587370463 18<20bpalmer18>	I do know that in the 19th century, upper class British folks could do multiple exchanges in a day
T 1587370475 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: you used to have to pay to receive a letter, but you could refuse and not open it
T 1587370486 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: so people worked out you could encode short messages in the recipient name
T 1587370506 18<19twb18>	bpalmer: like "To: Alice 'Mum's Dead' Smith"
T 1587370529 18<19twb18>	And back then (before stamps) it was like $20 to receive a message, instead of $1 to send one
T 1587370545 18<19twb18>	So only super rich people routinely sent post
T 1587370970 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: imagine a world in which you can send mail to anybody you want.
T 1587370993 18<24rudybot18>	bpalmer: I find it hard to imagine that anybody really believes that stuff
T 1587371070 18<20bpalmer18>	rudybot: you're right. You need to choose the right color envelope and have the proper return address if you want people to open it.

T 1587599328 18<20dale18>	For pdf-tools and Emacs to be non-jagged on macOS, I believe pdf-tools would need to generate rasters of its pages at e.g. 2x resolution, then hand the raster off to the macOS-specific APIs to draw the image, so that macOS can handle drawing it onto a 1.5x/2x/whatever scaled display.

I've been digging through the docs and tried setting org-export-date-timestamp-format by adding %z but that didnt seem to help
T 1587665019 18<24holomorph18>	i think we'll be just fine largely ignoring emacs-devel

T 1587665076 18<25goatish18>	(originally this was for exporting but having them display in emacs too would be great too)
T 1587665077 18<20bpalmer18>	goatish: what command is C-c C-u .   ? In my org that just does an upheading
T 1587665117 18<20bpalmer18>	well, C-c C-u does that.
T 1587665134 18<29wgreenhouse18>	bandali: "flying in the face of" is kind of the question. I think the gnu.org page's attitude toward off-topic content "flies in the face of" the emacswiki rules (which are the only rules most of the ops here were ever aware existed for this channel)
T 1587665134 18<25goatish18>	That's a good question! I tried to do the C-h k but wasn't sure how to return the function for multi keys like that

T 1587665166 18<20bpalmer18>	goatish: C-h k and then start the sequence ; when it stops accepting input, you've reached the command :)
T 1587665168 18<29wgreenhouse18>	there is a direct conflict, is off-topic content in general allowed (with limitations) or not
T 1587665172 18<25goatish18>	I think it's org-time-stamp
T 1587665206 18<27scheming_around18>	This is driving me mad: for some reason, pdf-tools doesn't work correctly when scrolling down using the mouse, but it does work correctly when scrolling up

T 1587665250 18<27scheming_around18>	When scrolling down, the page just scrolls out of the frame and then pdf-tools redisplays that page from the beginning
T 1587665255 18<20bpalmer18>	aha. C-u C-c is different than C-c C-u . C-u is the "universal prefix" -- running it before a command usually changes it in some way
T 1587665279 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, regarding being on/off topic, that gnu.org pages says: Keep it on topic — personal attacks, trolling/baiting or flooding (posting multiple repetitive lines or large amounts of code) of the channel will not be tolerated.

T 1587665481 18<25bandali18>	wgreenhouse, i don't think we need to keep #emacs *strictly* emacs-related at all times. hell, even #gnu and #fsf sometimes diverge into drastically off-topic discussions sometimes. in those cases, we gently remind people to try and bring discussion back to topic and perhaps take unrelated discussion to more appropriate places
T 1587665497 18<27tromey18>	TBH, emacs is normally more off-topic but also perhaps less trolly/irritating than some other chans
T 1587665515 18<27tromey18>	anyway I would be opposed to a major policy change, since IME #emacs works well already

T 1602790443 18<19wasamasa18>	the gravest concern for guilemacs is whether guile as a scheme can shoulder the demands of emacs

T 1602881469 18<20bpalmer18>	but before I go, I'd suggest rather than a setq approach, if you do write such a macro to iterate over and mutate, that it be something like (defmacro* dolines (line-sym &optional replace-sym) ...) so that you can do (dolines (x replace-line) (replace-line (concat "abc: " x))) , where replace-sym defaults to something like replace-line
T 1602881507 18<20bpalmer18>	It strikes me as a very unusual interface to treat mutating x as a sign to flush it out; almost ORM-like in hidden behavior.

T 1602881598 18<20bpalmer18>	although allowing it to be a random symbol means that you might need a codewalker. Hmm.
T 1602881602 18<19wasamasa18>	wgreenhouse: though, maybe we could convince sachac to do it
T 1602881625 18<20bpalmer18>	It might be better to just always locally bind replace-line to a function; that way elisp's normal semantics/reader apply.
T 1602881644 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: granted, a maplines could be a better idea.  (defun* maplines (fun &optional (buffer (current-buffer))) (let ((result '())) (with-current-buffer buffer (dolines (start end) (push (funcall fun (buffer-substring start end)) result))) result))  (reduce 'max (maplines 'length (current-buffer)) :initial-value 0)  --> 493
T 1602881756 18<20pjb18>	bpalmer: but dolines let you use the usual buffer mutation operators.  (dolines (start end)  (goto-char start) (insert "{") (goto-char end) (insert "}")) ; start and end are markers.
T 1602881783 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: I haven't looked at your code, simply johnjay's proposed interface above.
T 1602882306 18<20bpalmer18>	And I guess the functional route would be to pass a callback function 
T 1602882462 18<29johnjay18>	>I have noticed that some packages like lastpass or helm-lastpass guide users to non-free or proprietary software, thousands of such packages have been downloaded thus putting MELPA users at greater risks.
T 1602882513 18<29johnjay18>	pjb: hrm you can't use the buffer functions in a callback with maplines?
T 1602883076 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: you could pass start and end as additionnal parameters to the fun.
T 1602883112 18<19wrycode18>	IME tabnine provides no major advantage over well-configured dabbrev, capf, etc.
T 1602883144 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: my dolines macro leaves the point at the end-of-line, but it doesn't offer this guarantee. You have to use the start and end markers.
