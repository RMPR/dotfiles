T 1614281849 18<20bpalmer18>	as specified in Using Lexical Binding, note that the alternative (file local variable section at the end) does not work for lexical-binding
T 1614281862 18<19seabass18>	bpalmer, thank you very much
T 1614281877 18<19seabass18>	That's really important to me; I'm working on an Emacs package 
T 1614282094 18<28krux0218>	what package are you working on?
T 1614282113 18<28krux0218>	bpalmer, I always wonder how optional lexical-binding works.
T 1614282143 18<28krux0218>	I mean normally all variables are looked up in the dynamic stack
T 1614282216 18<28krux0218>	but when I run functions from modules back and forth one module has lexical binding, the other one requires dynamic binding, how does that coexist in the same lisp machine?
T 1614282225 18<20bpalmer18>	but what this variable presupposes is, what if they weren't?
T 1614282254 18<19seabass18>	krux02, I'm working on a package called 'subed'. sachac suggested to me that others might appreciate my patches, so I'm tidying them up to send upstream :)
T 1614282292 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: when interpreted, each variable has a conceptual flag associated with it about whether it's "special" -- in which case dynamic lookup should be used, or otherwise, lexical lookup should be used.
T 1614282339 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: when a lexical variable would escape its environment, a new 'closure' form is created, capturing the value of the variable at that time.
T 1614282490 18<28krux0218>	so lets say I have a lexcal variables `a` in file `A` and in file B where lexical scoping is not enabled, and a function `foo` tries to used `a`, it will still works when foo is called from A?
T 1614282533 18<28krux0218>	it is just the lookup that is affected by lexical scoping, not the definition?
T 1614282574 18<19seabass18>	bpalmer, do I need to align the */s, and if so, how?
T 1614282594 18<19seabass18>	please excuse the probably basic question :)
T 1614282643 18<20bpalmer18>	krux02: no, it will not work; the lexically scoped a in A will only be visible inside its lexical scope. (typically the let where it's bound)
T 1614282659 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: I"m not sure I understand; what */s are you looking at?
T 1614282676 18<19seabass18>	In the local variables info page, the */s are lined up
T 1614282680 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: you can have -*-  lexical-binding: t -*-   anywhere in the firstline
T 1614282698 18<19seabass18>	'come the variable names'...
T 1614282706 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: you do need both a leading and a trailing -*- 
T 1614282723 18<19seabass18>	bpalmer: sorry, I should have been clearer - this is for the alternative method
T 1614282730 18<28krux0218>	bpalmer, so lexically scoped variables are not part of the dynamic stack environment that is available for variable lookup?
T 1614282730 18<19seabass18>	for Eval:
T 1614282736 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: the alternative method does not work for lexical binding.
T 1614282747 18<19seabass18>	bpalmer, yes, but this is a different file
T 1614282758 18<19seabass18>	/* eval: (buttercup-minor-mode) */ is what I'm doing
T 1614282783 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: oh, no, the /* and */ don't need to line up.
T 1614282796 18<19seabass18>	bpalmer, thanks :)
T 1614282813 18<20bpalmer18>	it's usually suggested you don't try to activate minor modes through file comments, though.
T 1614282840 18<20bpalmer18>	think of a person who tries to open the file without buttercup around, or doesn't like buttercups
T 1614282840 18<19seabass18>	oh, really? I'd like to learn more about this
T 1614282849 18<19seabass18>	so missing dependencies is the issue?
T 1614282856 18<28krux0218>	I think I have to play more and experiment with lexical scoping in emacs. As there are still many things unclear to me.
T 1614282884 18<29mplsCorwin18>	seabass: and leaving room for preference, I think
T 1614282899 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: no, it's just ... not everybody likes the same modes. Major modes, they're more typically things you "have" to use
T 1614282915 18<20bpalmer18>	(ignoring things like people who prefer to use text-mode to work with markdown files, for example)
T 1614282919 18<28krux0218>	It is not lexcal scoping that I am confused about nor dynamic scoping. It is the coexistence of both of those scoping rules at the same time in the same virtual machine.
T 1614282936 18<19seabass18>	ah, OK - this is for the testing files, mind you, so hopefully the end user would not come across it by accident
T 1614282936 18<20bpalmer18>	And even then, specifying the mode  is a bit aggressive when you can just use auto-mode-alist
T 1614283014 18<19seabass18>	I'm not familiar with buttercup, but I think that this file (test-subed-common.el) just wouldn't work without it
T 1614283014 18<20bpalmer18>	OK. I don't know much about it; but eval blocks will usually prompt the user.
T 1614283031 18<29mplsCorwin18>	,buttercup

T 1614283066 18<24ski18>	seabass : hm, i think `mode: buttercup-minor' may work ?
T 1614283071 18<19seabass18>	yes, indeed - this package contains a 'test' directory with testing lisp files

T 1614283098 18<29mplsCorwin18>	seabass: maybe a dirs-local then?
T 1614283111 18<24ski18>	(instead of the sledgehammer of `eval')
T 1614283150 18<19seabass18>	hmm well it ought to be a seperate 'pull request', but it does look interesting to use mode:
T 1614283207 18<20bpalmer18>	To quote the info manual, "Do not use the mode keyword for minor modes." It endorses the eval form
T 1614283217 18<19seabass18>	hmm this gets complicated quickly :D
T 1614283232 18*	19seabass looks up auto-mode-alist
T 1614283241 18<20bpalmer18>	I am sure I read somewhere or other an admonition against minor modes in file local variables; I definitely agree with it, but .. hm. Maybe some random person's opinion.
T 1614283252 18<29mplsCorwin18>	If you have a folder full of test programs and you want them all to come up with a given minor mode active, I think you could want to simply turn on the minor mode in a Per-Directory manner: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html
T 1614283268 18<20bpalmer18>	seabass: auto-mode-alist maps between filenames and major modes; it's how emacs knows a .c file should be in c-mode and a .pl file should be in prolog-mode
T 1614283270 18<19seabass18>	ooh, nice, mplsCorwin
T 1614283404 18<19seabass18>	I don't know about mode: vs eval: here, but directory variables seems like the right approach, considering that *all* files in one directory are lexically scoped, and *all* files in the other are for testing

Probably much faster and easier.  I think ngz opined something to this effect when we were talking about modifying links that had been parsed with org-element.

T 1615363946 18<25susam18>	roxlu: Are you sure it is an IPv4 vs. IPv6 issue and not an HTTP vs. HTTPS issue? Can you revert the ELPA URL, reproduce the issue, and look at netstat -na or ss output to see that your Emacs is indeed trying to connect via IPv6 and hence the issue occurs?

T 1615364029 18<25susam18>	roxlu: One way to narrow down the cause of the issue would be to map elpa.gnu.org to its IPv4 address in /etc/hosts and try the HTTPS URL again.
T 1615364086 18<25susam18>	roxlu: Okay, if you did check both HTTP and HTTPS and the issue occured in both cases, it does provide evidence for IPv6 being the issue. On top of that if you try the above /etc/hosts experiment, it will provide double-confirmation on the theory.
T 1615364146 18<25susam18>	That is, map elpa.gnu.org to IPv4 address in /etc/hosts, try HTTPS URL again. If it succeeds, then yes, IPv6 could be the issue. If it fails, then IPv6 is not the issue because it fails with IPv4 too and HTTPS might be the issue.

T 1615364612 18<25susam18>	roxlu: Okay, the version also confirms it is likely not an HTTPS issue. The HTTPS issue (actually a TLS 1.3 support issue) was present only in Emacs 26.1 and 26.2. This must be an IPv6 issue then like you suspected.

This might sound crazy but I would have been happier to write plugins in Vim in C or Java rather than VimL, it is so bad. The fact that I can customize Emacs in Lisp such a breath of fresh air.

So, the issue is that when I start Emacs, lispy loads first, `inf-clojure` is not loaded yet and I get thi

T 1617885793 18<29CyberShadow18>	I would like is so that when I hit M-; while I have zero or more whole lines selected, I get the default comment-dwim behavior, but if I hit it while I have some non-whole fragment of line(s) selected, it uses the /* */ style to insert the block comment-start and comment-end (with no extra spaces) at region-beginning and region-end.

T 1617885838 18<29CyberShadow18>	For whatever reason Emacs really, really wants to insert those spaces after/before /* and */.
T 1617885857 18<29CyberShadow18>	It puts the spaces in comment-start and comment-end, but even if I take them out, it still inserts them into the buffer.

T 1617886188 18<19twb18>	Well you are patching "c-mode-comment-dwim" which suggests it's C
T 1617886271 18<29CyberShadow18>	No, it's cc-mode. It uses the c- prefix for code common to all languages.
T 1617886301 18<19twb18>	What language is it?
T 1617886310 18<29CyberShadow18>	Are you asking out of curiosity? :)
T 1617886313 18<29CyberShadow18>	It's D.
T 1617886365 18<19twb18>	Hm, I thought that had a dedicated major mode, but I don't see it
T 1617886374 18<29CyberShadow18>	It does. It's based on cc-mode.
T 1617886498 18<28Odin-18>	So, it's "language not yet supported" rather than "language fundamentally not compatible with"?
T 1617886520 18<29CyberShadow18>	cc-mode is kind of designed to be extensible
T 1617886539 18<28Odin-18>	I meant the clang-format comment.
T 1617886555 18<29CyberShadow18>	Ah. Well, clang is a C/C++ front-end.
T 1617886569 18<29CyberShadow18>	D has its own LLVM-based compiler. It does not format code.
T 1617886583 18<28Odin-18>	Even so, clang-format apparently supports both Java and C#.

T 1617886724 18<19twb18>	Both ldc and calypso have a .clang-format in their source tree which sounds pretty suspicious for a language that can't be clang-formatted
T 1617886773 18<19twb18>	Current clang-format manual says "C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf"

So I have a a set of pairs (University, [Applicant]).  Since Students also have preferences, I actually have [(University, [Applicant, Applicant's_Order_Of_Preference])].  Since universities only accept a limited number of students, some students won't be accepted. Of course, a lot of them applied to multiple

T 1618171762 18<22thblt18>	This first algorithm is trivial. There's another one: if, for some university, none of the students above the threshold have another application of a higher preference rating, then that university's selection is now closed. So all applicants below threshold are dropped, sorry.
T 1618171897 18<22thblt18>	Repeat those two until they stabilize (that is, f1(f2(state)) == state), there are two possible outcomes. A) All selections are closed, all good.

There's an obvious solution there: delete A1's application to U1, and A2's to U2.
T 1618172061 18<22thblt18>	Doing that, both get accepted into their first choice.
T 1618172091 18<22thblt18>	Now, this is an easy case. The hard part is: how to generalize?
T 1618172298 18<22thblt18>	My first idea is to find cycles.  In this case, we have a A1(pref=2)-A2(pref=2) cycle at admission rank 1, and A1(pref=1), A2(pref=2) cycle at rank 2.  Cycles: two loops (A1-A2-A1) at different "levels" of the ranking system, so that for each student in both loops, their preference for their application in the higher loop is lower than the other.
T 1618172447 18<22thblt18>	For correctly chosen cycles, removing applications on the "higher" cycle will increase the chances of admission of the lower cycle, but there's a risk that a student comes from admitted to their second choice to not admitted at all -- which we don't want, because global happiness.
T 1618172555 18<22thblt18>	So: if cycles the good approach, the question that remains is how to choose, and how to have an algorithm that runs in reasonable time and space for real-world figures of roughly 700k applicants and a few thousands "universities", with an average of 10 applications per applicant.
