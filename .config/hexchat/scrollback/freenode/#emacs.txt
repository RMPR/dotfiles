T 1602881625 18<20bpalmer18>	It might be better to just always locally bind replace-line to a function; that way elisp's normal semantics/reader apply.
T 1602881644 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: granted, a maplines could be a better idea.  (defun* maplines (fun &optional (buffer (current-buffer))) (let ((result '())) (with-current-buffer buffer (dolines (start end) (push (funcall fun (buffer-substring start end)) result))) result))  (reduce 'max (maplines 'length (current-buffer)) :initial-value 0)  --> 493
T 1602881756 18<20pjb18>	bpalmer: but dolines let you use the usual buffer mutation operators.  (dolines (start end)  (goto-char start) (insert "{") (goto-char end) (insert "}")) ; start and end are markers.

T 1602911348 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: you don't need to require them if you set the variable absolutely without trying to read it.

T 1602911369 18<20bpalmer18>	no, only if you try to *read* the variable, when it's not set.
T 1602911374 18<20pjb18>	This wil break a lot of commands.
T 1602911389 18<20pjb18>	It's set, since I customize it in my rc files.

T 1602911468 18<20pjb18>	No, I removed it, because I want to autojoin manually…
T 1602911511 18<20bpalmer18>	pjb: you need to load the library to have the variables it defines; having it in the erc-modules list has a side effect of loading it as well as activating it.
T 1602911521 18<20pjb18>	So I guess I have to load erc-autojoin, without adding it to erc-modules so that autojoin is not done, but I can access it. Ok. Thanks.

T 1602912236 18<20pjb18>	Didn't work. Well, after all I don't want to autojoin, so I will use my own variable. There's no reason to use that erc customization variable…
T 1602912341 18<29mplsCorwin18>	I wonder if this is a case for eval-after-load, as in (eval-after-load 'erc-autojoin-mode (setq ...))

T 1602914413 18<26buhman18>	I just started reading LFN and my mind is completely blown away by this black magic: https://gist.github.com/buhman/a856392c5b772564797d8585961d45dc (a lisp-1 interpreter written in lisp-1, with trivial glue to in turn port the interpreter to scheme)
T 1602914882 18<20pjb18>	buhman: don't worry, Dijkstra ever could understand lisp either.  
T 1602914889 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but this xeval is the core of lisp.
T 1602914902 18<20pjb18>	buhman: lisp is defined by an evaluation function written in lisp itself.
T 1602914934 18<20pjb18>	buhman: this means that introspection and reflexivity is built in the core of lisp.
T 1602914955 18<20pjb18>	externally, this shows by the fact that lisp programs are not written as code, but as data.
T 1602914973 18<20pjb18>	buhman: the syntax of sexp, is a syntax for DATA. Symbolic Expressions are data.
T 1602915009 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so this xeval function can take some data, a sexp, that represents a lisp form, some code. But since it's data, it can process it and interpret it.
T 1602915028 18<20pjb18>	buhman: now the thing is that this xeval is expressed as a sexp too in this file!
T 1602915040 18<20pjb18>	buhman: so we need something to bootstrap the system.
T 1602915072 18<26buhman18>	yeah, quite cool there's no parsing involved; xeval is effectivenly being passed a pre-parsed ast.
T 1602915073 18<20pjb18>	buhman: Russel, a student of McCarthy showed that it could be written as a "simple" 7090 assembler program. It was LISP 1.
T 1602915087 18<20pjb18>	buhman: but of course, you can also use a lisp (scheme) to bootstrap it too.
T 1602915089 18<26buhman18>	super excited to read the rest of this, for the bootstrapping stuff too
T 1602915104 18<20pjb18>	buhman: well, it's not exactly an AST, but close enough.
T 1602915136 18<20pjb18>	buhman: there's sometimes some "syntax" inside the sexps, that can be "parsed".
T 1602915163 18<26buhman18>	you mean, if the interpreter implemented macros?
T 1602915175 18<20pjb18>	For example.
T 1602915215 18<20pjb18>	This is because we write data that we need this QUOTE operator, to tell xeval that we have here a sexp literal, instead of a sexp that represents code to be interpreted.
T 1602915265 18<20pjb18>	McCarthy originally planed to have M-expressions for the code.  car([A,B,C]) -> A  instead of (CAR (QUOTE (A B C))).
T 1602915282 18<20pjb18>	Have a look at http://informatimago.com/develop/lisp/com/informatimago/small-cl-pgms/m-expression/index.html
T 1602915331 18<20pjb18>	This didn't add anything. Using sexps was simplier, and once we have macros (invented in 1964), (and before that there was already fexprs), it locked in the sexps.
T 1602916765 18<29johnjay18>	pjb: but what about that old thing from lisp machines where it used proper names
T 1602916777 18<29johnjay18>	like instead of this-is-a-function it was M-x This Is A Function <RET>
T 1602916788 18<29johnjay18>	i'm sure i saw that in a video demo
T 1602916950 18<29mplsCorwin18>	could be done just with an overlay in M-:, I'd think
T 1602916956 18<29mplsCorwin18>	oops, M-x
T 1602916993 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: this is something you can do in emacs too. (all emacsen I know too).
T 1602917051 18<20pjb18>	johnjay: but indeed, early sexps used the comma to separate atoms, not the space, Hence in my example, car[(A,B,C)] (I interchanged () with []).
T 1602917067 18<20pjb18>	Because it was (ONE SYMBOL,ANOTHER SYMBOL,A THIRD SYMBOL)
T 1602917096 18<20pjb18>	But in the first implementation of LISP, it was already  (ONE-SYMBOL ANOTHER-SYMBOL A-THIRD-SYMBOL)
T 1602917140 18<20pjb18>	I don't know if the possibility to enter commands with spaces in emacsen comes from that, I doubt it. It probably come from the same ergonomic and user-friendly reasons.
T 1602917191 18<20pjb18>	That said if you type a space in M-x it actually just completes the text, and inserts dashes, instead of a space.
T 1602917210 18<20pjb18>	but Zwei and Hemlock explicitely define commands using strings with spaces.
T 1602917219 18<29mplsCorwin18>	I wonder if there's already an option to give "Friendly Caps" and hide the spaces, e.g. with an overlay.

T 1603107565 18<19tinga18>	Hi. I've got a hook on 'inferior-scheme-mode-hook which runs `(paredit-mode 1)`, *then* runs a series of `(define-key inferior-scheme-mode-map ..)` actions; somehow the later don't have any effect if paredit-mode is turned on, otherwise they work fine.
T 1603107569 18<19tinga18>	Why is this?
T 1603107603 18<19tinga18>	(It seems like using paredit-mode makes inferior-scheme-mode-hook not use inferior-scheme-mode-map. ?)
T 1603107650 18<22thblt18>	tinga: (1) define-key in a hook is weird.
T 1603107679 18<22thblt18>	wdym don't have any effect? Are the  keys unbound, or stolen by paredit?
T 1603107682 18<19tinga18>	(paredit.el recommends using `eval-after-load` but that is only called once after paredit.el is loaded, right? Not each time it's turned on.)
T 1603107698 18<19tinga18>	thblt, stolen by paredit
T 1603107715 18<19tinga18>	i.e. the same as if I didn't use define-key at all
T 1603107751 18<22thblt18>	tinga: yes, but you don't want to bind keys each time it's turned on, you just need to customize the bindings to your liking once.
T 1603107802 18<19tinga18>	The problem is paredit shadows some essential key bindings from inferior-scheme-mode-hook; I prefer to have those over the paredit ones in this context.
T 1603107819 18<22thblt18>	keymaps precedence issues are tricky. If you never use those paredit bindings, you can just remove them.
T 1603107825 18<19tinga18>	Like, M-r to get at history, or C-d
T 1603107844 18<19tinga18>	I do use them in scheme-mode (normal text editing).
T 1603107876 18<19tinga18>	I'm just confused how key maps work, I thought it was 1 key map active at any one time, looks like that's not what happens.
T 1603107924 18<22thblt18>	absolutely not. It's a ton of keymaps active at every single time.
T 1603108034 18<19tinga18>	Or said differently, I thought that inferior-scheme-mode-map is the combined key map that is used while in inferior-scheme-mode (maybe put together from various other key maps, but I thought that inferior-scheme-mode-map is the entry point for key mappings when in inferor-scheme-mode)
T 1603108066 18<19tinga18>	Emacs is like super low level and high level at the same time it seems.
T 1603108078 18<22thblt18>	I *think* the cleanest solution lies somewhere in reordering ,,dv minor-mode-map-alist
T 1603108078 18<22fsbot18>	Alist of keymaps to use for minor modes.
T 1603108079 18<22fsbot18>	Each element looks like (VARIABLE . KEYMAP); KEYMAP is used to read
T 1603108079 18<22fsbot18>	key sequences and look up bindings if VARIABLE’s value is non-nil.
T 1603108079 18<22fsbot18>	If two active keymaps bind the same key, the keymap appearing earlier
T 1603108079 18<22fsbot18>	in the list takes precedence.
T 1603108102 18<22thblt18>	But really you should read about keymaps first.
T 1603108104 18<20pjb18>	It's also a property of lisp.  Lisp primitives are actually low-level. But we have macros to implement a higher level language.
T 1603108206 18<19tinga18>	(Sure (and I'm a long time lisper), but Emacs as an API I sometimes feel I'm working on a really low level, now I'm surprised that key maps are much higher level than I'm used to. I don't have that much Emacs experience, though.)
T 1603108380 18<22thblt18>	Emacs is low level given hardware that doesn't actually exist.
T 1603108387 18<20pjb18>	tinga: indeed. The API is often difficult to use.  It's more like an exportation of the internals, than a well designed and easy to use API.
T 1603108407 18<22thblt18>	Like Haskell is assembly language in an alternative history of computing :)
T 1603108434 18<20pjb18>	I only started learning Haskell, so so far, I only have bad things to say about it… :-/
T 1603108447 18<20pjb18>	It's quite not exactly like the revelation you may have when learning lisp.
T 1603108651 18<22thblt18>	pjb: It's Haskell that has only bad things to say about YOU.
T 1603108682 18<22thblt18>	(I'm joking, of course)
T 1603108813 18<20pjb18>	Indeed, so far.
T 1603108846 18<22thblt18>	pjb: what book/course are you using?
T 1603108967 18<19tinga18>	(I feel that Haskell and Scheme aren't that different, except Haskell replaces the dynamic nature of Lisps with a static one (including using typed AST nodes for Template Haskell over the dynamic s-expr representation of lisps). That's good and bad in some respective ways.)
T 1603109004 18<19tinga18>	(As I sometimes say, Haskell feels like the C++ of functional programming.)
T 1603109127 18<22thblt18>	I feel that the much stronger constraints on mutation have a deep impact of the language.
T 1603109141 18<22thblt18>	You can't hack your way around with a (set) and a shameful comment.
T 1603109177 18<19tinga18>	True, I should have qualified my statement with "aren't that different if you use functional separation in Scheme, too"
T 1603109192 18<22thblt18>	But I've been playing with Haskell, on and off, for… some time, and it hasn't fully clicked yet.  By contrast, it took me… hours, say, to start feeling confident with Rust.
T 1603109228 18<19tinga18>	(Also note that in Haskell you can hack your way via mutation too by using the state monad locally.)
T 1603109258 18<22thblt18>	tinga: of course, but it's already way harder than a (set)
T 1603109266 18<19tinga18>	I'm finding Rust more difficult to tame than Haskell.
T 1603109271 18<22thblt18>	tinga: you need to know the state monad, for a start :)
T 1603109281 18<20bpalmer18>	emacs keymaps are inferior to xemacs keymaps.  opaque structures > lists in terms of presenting an API
T 1603109307 18<20bpalmer18>	not really related to what you were discovering with keymap precedence, though.
T 1603109326 18<19tinga18>	thblt, sure but that's part of dynamic <-> static, so I cover it with the "except" :)
T 1603109338 18<22thblt18>	tinga: it's a matter of taste, I think. Rust looks a lot like C as I like it, with the things I miss in C added :)
T 1603109374 18<19tinga18>	I find Rust boring compared to Haskell except when it comes to life times... then I want to go back to Haskell :)

T 1603199358 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: but otherwise, you have two variables holding indent functions: indent-line-function and indent-region-function.
T 1603199367 18<20pjb18>	that's because of your parentheses!
T 1603199374 18<20pjb18>	Use defun if you want less indentation.
T 1603199398 18<20pjb18>	so you should look at the functions stored in those variables, and see their documentation and how they can be customized.
T 1603199411 18<20_maddy18>	I don't have defun, this is my own custom lisp language :)
T 1603199412 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: alternatively, you can write your own indenting function and store it in those varibles.
T 1603199538 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: the standard lisp-indent-region calls lisp-indent-line (directly, not thru the variable).
T 1603199650 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: if you use those functions eventually lisp-indent-function is called, and it uses properties set to the operator symbol to compute the indentation.
T 1603199682 18<20pjb18>	_maddy: so you could configure a lisp-indent-function property on fn, to ensure a negative indentation.

T 1612133704 18<20bpalmer18>	I can fully believe there are utilities that automatically do it; I can't think of one in the elisp modes that does it, though.
T 1612133733 18<20bpalmer18>	asm mode does the alignment by default, though
T 1612133761 18<20bpalmer18>	but asm-mode is very column oriented.

T 1612133902 18<28VincentVega18>	Yeah, I was thinking maybe some mode splits the line for some processing (for whatever reason), the comment ends up on the empty line, aggressive-indent indents it, and the line is then sewn back together (and I think it got aligned), but that's pretty far fetched.

T 1612208308 18<22ckx18>	dale: that's interesting. I'd think that emacs would try and find a fallback font itself (or just a compiled-in font), not that the OS would serve it an alternative.
T 1612208337 18<20dale18>	ckx: I think this has to do because Emacs tries to delegate text rendering to macOS's CoreText, and that's just how the API works, or at least the work has not been put in on Emacs to make it behave otherwise, but we're pretty far outside my personal experience so I could be wrong.

T 1612214053 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: If you get this error, it means that this let made dynamic bindings.  Dynamic = WHEN; lexical = WHERE.
T 1612214071 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: nowadays, emacs is able to do lexical bindings, and has closures. 
T 1612214101 18<20kuba-orlik18>	I see - but this used to work for years now, did something in the behavior of `let` change recently?
T 1612214102 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: you should activate it with a (setq lexical-binding t) at the start of your source.

T 1612214225 18<20pjb18>	now lambda can return closures.

T 1612214430 18<20pjb18>	Either use global dynamic variables, (but then you can have only one context active at a time), or use local lexical variables (then you can have several contextes, each enclosed in their own closures).
T 1612214461 18<20pjb18>	Since you started with a kuba/generate-mu4-context I'd advise the lexical-binding way.
T 1612214475 18<20pjb18>	Just add (setf lexical-binding t) to your source.

T 1612214640 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: the bug in your code was that with dynamic binding let creates a variable named addresses. Then it makes a mu4e-context, with a lambda that uses the dynamic variable named addresses. Then the let destroys the dynamic variable named addresses.  Then later you will call the lambda, and there will be no dynamic variable named addresses.
T 1612214652 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: the solution would be to define such a global variable with (defvar addresses).
T 1612214668 18<20pjb18>	But then you would have to assign it with setf instead of using let (which creates a new variable).
T 1612214676 18<20pjb18>	cf the first way in teh above url.
T 1612214698 18<24npostavs18>	pjb: the correct way to set lexical binding for elisp is putting -*- lexical-binding: t -*- on the first line of the file (you also have to setf if you want it respected immediately by C-M-x and friends)
T 1612214701 18<24deego18>	kuba-orlik: in the older days, one would do things like `(lambda (...)   ...   ,addresses ...) which you can still do, ofc
T 1612214710 18<20pjb18>	kuba-orlik: if your code worked before, it was because some other code had created this global variable named addresses. But your let didn't modify it.
