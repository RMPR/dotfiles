T 1570823738 18<28Yosemitesam18>	stepnem, yeah I've read it, but I don't exactly get how my own function should look like
T 1570823990 18<29stepnem18>	Yosemitesam: As described in the add-function doc string, in case of :around advice, the first argument of the advice is the original function, followed by the original function's arguments. You do your thing and call the original function somewhere from inside the advice.
T 1570824026 18*	20dale doesn't have a read-password function.

T 1570824067 18<28Yosemitesam18>	stepnem, thank you! I literally just now understand what that "(lambda....) stuff in the docu means
T 1570824163 18<20dale18>	Yosemitesam: Ex. (defun my-read-passwd-advice (orig-fun &rest args) (unwind-protect (progn (<change frame title here>) (apply orig-fun args)) (<change frame title back here>))) (advice-add 'read-passwd :around #'my-read-passwd-advice)
T 1570824228 18<29stepnem18>	Yosemitesam: I think if you read the info manual it's quite clear, and with examples. The doc string is a bit terse, indeed. Just an overview.
T 1570824320 18<28Yosemitesam18>	dale, thanks a lot! I was almost there but still missing the "%rest" :D
T 1570824350 18<20dale18>	Yosemitesam: I hope you typed &rest not %rest in your code. :)
T 1570824372 18<28Yosemitesam18>	stepnem, yeah, but I didn't find an example function in the info manual
T 1570824378 18<29stepnem18>	Yosemitesam: In your case (orig-fun prompt &rest _args) might be more useful, as you'll need the prompt argument.

T 1570824420 18<29stepnem18>	Yosemitesam: Really? The section I pointed to is full of examples.

T 1570824482 18<20dale18>	stepnem: (My personal convention is not to name it _args when I'm going to actually use it in the body of the function, even if just passing to apply in this case.)
T 1570824529 18<29stepnem18>	dale: Exactly, I was just typing that now... sorry for the confusion. Didn't realize you'll need the rest, too, anyway.
T 1570824728 18<29stepnem18>	Yosemitesam: Just to be completely clear in case you're actually gonna use it, the underscore shouldn't be there. It's useful to add it if you don't use the argument as a hint to Emacs byte compiler, but here it was a thinko on my part.

T 1570826514 18<20dale18>	work_: Yes, AFAIK you either configure a macOS key to be an Emacs modifier, or IIRC you can set the corresponding Emacs var for the modifier key to nil and it will behave as it does in the rest of macOS.
T 1570826596 18<20dale18>	work_: Ex. I just set ns-right-option-modifier to nil (was 'left) and now I can do things like ⌥u u to type ü.
T 1570826651 18<20dale18>	work_: Note that Emacs does have at least a few ways to enter "special characters", try C-x 8 " u also enters ü, for example.  See also the TeX input method in Emacs, which seems somewhat popular.
T 1570826683 18<27work_18>	dale: that is exactly what I want so I can use right option as my good old AltGr key 
T 1570826715 18<20dale18>	work_: You know, I just did that with ns-right-option-modifier, and my left option key followed suit, which seems odd.  Check all your modifiers after setting.

T 1584535480 18<19wasamasa18>	well, then you've got some learning to do
T 1584535481 18<29quiliro18>	i will investigate

T 1584535701 18<19wasamasa18>	but yeah, it's a good idea to experiment with a simpler xml document
T 1584535935 18<19jmd18>	Is there a way I can put some special filter/postprocessing in the *compilation* buffer ?
T 1584536092 18<29quiliro18>	CSS selectors are just selected style patterns
T 1584536133 18<29quiliro18>	never used named them as such ...but I can recognize them in the files.
T 1584536134 18<19wasamasa18>	if you can write css selectors that match the part of the xml document you're interested in, you're good to go
T 1584536223 18<29quiliro18>	I can ...I see you did when you wrote: (esxml-query "comprobante>factura>detalles" xml)
T 1584536244 18<29quiliro18>	and I can see the tree is that way on my xml file
T 1584536286 18<29quiliro18>	comprobante is the bigger branch from which factura emerges ... and detalles emerges from factura
T 1584536352 18<29quiliro18>	But I got nothing if I execute that command or even one created by me:
T 1584536367 18<19wasamasa18>	then the query doesn't match anything in that document
T 1584536408 18<29quiliro18>	it does
T 1584536423 18<19wasamasa18>	at some point you
T 1584536425 18<29quiliro18>	but maybe the xml file is not recognized because of CDATA
T 1584536433 18<19wasamasa18>	I mean, at some point you've made a mistake then
T 1584536453 18<19wasamasa18>	yes, matching isn't done inside cdata because cdata is a way to quote text in a xml document
T 1584536464 18<19wasamasa18>	that quoted text isn't its own tree you can perform matching on
T 1584536477 18<19wasamasa18>	it's text you have to extract, parse and process
T 1584536547 18<29quiliro18>	ok...will try now....thanks for your pointers, wasamasa 
T 1584537365 18<22thblt18>	amosbird: no idea. There's a package called unfill to do the unfilling, but de-hyphenating is impossible, unless the PDF uses a different character for the hyphenation dash.  
T 1584537764 18<26loskutak18>	oh my gosh, I think I will mostly stop using tramp. Working on localhost and then rsyncing to the remote is so frigging fast :D

T 1584537988 18<24dustfinger18>	I use exwm and am constantly working. I would like to slowly re-write my emacs config. Is there a safe way to reload the config, while running exwm so that I don't have to close all my buffers inbetween?
T 1584538013 18<28python47618>	thblt: first time I realize the purpose of having different dash

T 1584538234 18<29quiliro18>	What is ROOT in (esxml-query SELECTOR ROOT) ? the highest level branch, or the branch directly above SELECTOR?

T 1584538283 18<29quiliro18>	oh!
T 1584538307 18<20AimHere18>	amosbird, if it isn't, the meaning would be obvious enough that if you started using it, everyone would know what you meant and you'd make a new word
T 1584538328 18<20AimHere18>	So I wouldn't worry about whether it is or not.

T 1584716021 18<19parsnip18>	please fill out this survey as you leave
T 1584716055 18<22thblt18>	I guess the rationale here is consistency.  /= or =/= would have been possible but != reads literal as "not equal"  
T 1584716072 18<22yeti18>	no colour/ink left....
T 1584716076 18<19parsnip18>	lol

T 1584716116 18<19parsnip18>	i guess Haskell only has `not` (and probably some silly non-ASCII)
T 1584716271 18<19parsnip18>	Haskell also likes to have strange strings that seem to approximate ⊛, ⊕, ⊞, etc.
T 1584716506 18<22thblt18>	I don’t think you can create a non-ascii prefix unary operator in Haskell.
T 1584716546 18<22thblt18>	Unary - is a compiler trick IIRC 
T 1584716597 18<22thblt18>	Yes, -3 expands to (negate 3) at desugaring phase.
T 1584716902 18<19parsnip18>	`!` True (jk)
T 1584716920 18<19parsnip18>	or wait, is that (!) True
T 1584717041 18<22thblt18>	`op` is to use the prefix function op infix, a `op` b 
T 1584717069 18<22thblt18>	(+) is to use the infix operator + prefix, (+) 1 2
T 1584718210 18<20Ronis_BR18>	Hi! What font do you use in emacs? When I change the font to Meslo Nerd Font, the performance become very,very,very bad
T 1584718264 18<19bremner18>	I use deja vu sans mono
T 1584718289 18<20Ronis_BR18>	hum, I do not have that in macOS
T 1584718297 18<22thblt18>	Ronis_BR: But your font shouldn’t affect performance. 
T 1584718312 18<22thblt18>	Menlo is Apple’s equivalent
T 1584718319 18<20Ronis_BR18>	thblt: it affects and it is very apparent
T 1584718320 18<20rdbeni018>	i am using:   (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
T 1584718417 18<29mplsCorwin18>	Could font affect performance if the selected font is missing a bunch of unicode chars, languages etc, and this causes a bunch of glyph hunting?
