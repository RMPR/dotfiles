T 1586686922 18<26GermainZ18>	__monty__: sometimes I do that, but I usually prefer an offline solution
T 1586686944 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: I do comments on pdfs via pdf-tools in Emacs.  It works with my supervisors, but my students can never figure out how it works.
T 1586686967 18<26GermainZ18>	__monty__: editing PDFs sucks unless it's a form, basically. Sucks much more than the alternative. And if you're exporting from Word using LO‚Ä¶ the PDF won't be perfect anyway (and it's quasi-impossible to fix) if it's a complex document
T 1586686969 18<22__monty__18>	I understand. It's just such a rare occurence for me that I can't be bothered to keep updating LO's multi-GB behemoth.

T 1586719806 18<22__monty__18>	Ok, so the article suggests there's three sorts of notes. I think you talked about this. Notes are like nodes of a graph, connection notes are like annotations to edges of this graph and outlines are like a filtered view on the graph?

T 1586720133 18<26zaeph18>	I think your assumptions are correct about the types of notes, although I'd put a caveat on the last type.  The bulk of your notes are going to be atomic notes which refer to concepts.
T 1586720188 18<26zaeph18>	Then, you have writing-driven notes which aim to articulate your other notes into a cohesive subject.  Have a possible outline for a topic you'd like to write?  It'd go in a note like this.  A revision to that outline?  Just create a new note and call it v2.
T 1586720211 18<26zaeph18>	As for your last type, the book makes it clear that you shouldn't have more than one of those note.  It's the index I was talking about.

T 1586720578 18<26zaeph18>	Your second type seems to be about saying why two atomics notes can be related, correct?
T 1586720672 18<22__monty__18>	Yeah, it's clarifying a link.
T 1586720695 18<26zaeph18>	It's because I consider those to be part of the same type as the outline driven notes.
T 1586720700 18<22__monty__18>	But the manuscript preparation notes that collect a list of identifiers are what I call outlines.
T 1586720705 18<26zaeph18>	In other words, it's either atomic or connective.
T 1586720726 18<26zaeph18>	Connective can just be two atomic notes, or it can be writing-driven
T 1586720735 18<26zaeph18>	That's how I understood it anyway.
T 1586720768 18<22__monty__18>	I don't see why you'd merge these. If you take my graph metaphor it becomes clearer how it can make sense to treat them differently.

T 1586720838 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah, I think that's the crux of the problem: we shouldn't be really thinking about types.
T 1586720851 18<26zaeph18>	As long as you're keeping your notes simple and connected, that's kind of the only thing you need.
T 1586720858 18<22__monty__18>	No, I think it makes sense to think of the types.

T 1586724317 18<22__monty__18>	Fair, I guess. Though couldn't you map the exact dead-key combinations to compose? For example if you use ralt+u to type √π, you could have compose-u mean the same thing.
T 1586724384 18<26zaeph18>	You could, but that'd prevent combinations with two letters.

T 1587235531 18<26zaeph18>	So, trashing is a sort of action to be run.
T 1587235655 18<29energizer18>	so if i press enter on a file it might get deleted?

T 1587235989 18<26zaeph18>	You could remove the action if you don't want it.  You'd have to look into your rifle.conf.
T 1587236184 18<22__monty__18>	energizer: It shouldn't be the default action for anything. It's even under "run as binary" which has been the least prioritised action since ranger's inception.
T 1587236223 18<22__monty__18>	Keep in mind that the indices of that list are currently sometimes fucked. So if you try to run the action above trash you might end up trashing.

T 1587332583 18<26GermainZ18>	How does it interact with nfs?
T 1587332643 18<22__monty__18>	Hardlink, look up inode, look up linked inode, done. Symlink, look up inode, read link, look up other inode by path, read contents.
T 1587332659 18<22__monty__18>	That's definitely gonna be more than a nanosecond.
T 1587332698 18<22__monty__18>	Symlinks are evaluated relative to the mount. So a symlink to a file outside the NFS share will point to that file on the user's system.
T 1587332702 18<26zaeph18>	Definitely a half-dozen nanoseconds, then.
T 1587332711 18<26GermainZ18>	Yeah, a couple nanoseconds depending on the CPU :D

T 1587332761 18<22__monty__18>	That *can* be used usefully, having a program on a share use a user's config for example. But that's rarely useful and the other way around, sharing files without having them in the shared directory is really common.
T 1587332764 18<26GermainZ18>	__monty__: oh I see about nfs
T 1587332794 18<22__monty__18>	You guys don't realize this is about disk IO. It's orders of magnitude slower.

T 1587332820 18<26GermainZ18>	It's still nanoseconds

T 1587332875 18<22__monty__18>	A single lookup on an SSD is on the order of 0.5 ms.
T 1587333015 18<26GermainZ18>	You're right, it's not nanoseconds
T 1587333059 18<26GermainZ18>	But 0.5 ms is probably the worst case with modern SSDs being a fraction of that
T 1587333064 18<22__monty__18>	It's literally millions of nanoseconds.
T 1587333070 18<26GermainZ18>	Still in the order of a few dozen/hundred microseconds
T 1587333137 18<29rnmhdn18>	but softlinks don't work with git do they?
T 1587333183 18<26GermainZ18>	depends on the config

T 1587333200 18<22__monty__18>	Why wouldn't they? I'd expect something similar to the NFS behavior.

T 1587370554 18<26zaeph18>	I just encrypt without a header and call it a day.
T 1587370568 18<26zaeph18>	Sure, it might give off a pattern on a SSD, but I haven't pushed the neurosis to that point yet.

T 1587370689 18<26zaeph18>	I use LUKS on LVM with a remote header that is itself in a passphrase-protected LUKS container.
T 1587370747 18<26zaeph18>	Which means than when the 2nd LUKS container is not here, you cannot decrypt the main LUKS container, and it will appear as noise to your system.  Forensics might be able to tell that a filesystem is in place because of the `trim` option needed to have SSDs last longer.

T 1587375016 18<26zaeph18>	But it's also because a lot of people on Emacs end up wiping their configs regularly.  I don't think I've ever done that.  I've just kept refining it from the beginning.

T 1603048254 18<26zaeph18>	Oh most definitely.
T 1603048351 18<26zaeph18>	Also, that vowel-shift-when-double-consonants in English isn't even consistant.
T 1603048361 18<26zaeph18>	You say 'literature', not 'lie-terature'.
T 1603048372 18<26zaeph18>	Yet, in French, we had to go ahead and write it 'litt√©rature'.
T 1603048405 18<26GermainZ18>	Yeah
T 1603048424 18<26zaeph18>	(And, specifically, it's not 'lie' at the start, despite being stressed, exactly because it's a loan-word, and wanted to replicate the French way of saying it.)
T 1603048463 18<22__monty__18>	Hmm, we have vowel-shift but it doesn't apply when the next vowel's a soft(?) e.
T 1603048465 18<26zaeph18>	Like, they had to go out of their way to remove the double-t which is in the Latin 'litteratura'.
T 1603048520 18<22__monty__18>	Though in this particular word in dutch the e isn't actually soft.
T 1603048528 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: In 'literature', you don't even have an 'e'-sound: it gets elided with the 'r', which acts as an approximant link with the next-schwa (i.e. the 'soft e' you mentioned).
T 1603048550 18<22__monty__18>	Anyway, vowel shift has a bunch of exceptions when the vowel's followed by an e.
T 1603048581 18<26zaeph18>	A'ight, that's enough phonology for tonight. :p

T 1603048763 18<26GermainZ18>	That sounded quite French to me
T 1603048791 18<22__monty__18>	Nah, the eh sounds like uh or even ah.
T 1603048809 18<22__monty__18>	It's hardly there but it's definitely there.
T 1603048814 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: It's definitely not a shwa, there.  The tongue makes a glide which looks like a vowel, but it's the 'r' sound, which is an approximant, i.e., a consonantic sound that is close to a vowel in its voicing, but which still plays the r√¥le of a consonant in the syllable.
T 1603048844 18<26GermainZ18>	"litrashur" I guess for me
T 1603048855 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶But honestly, in the past, we use to transcribe it with a superscript (…ô) to show that there was a vowel-like sound there.

T 1603048889 18<26GermainZ18>	Ah, makes sense
T 1603048913 18<26zaeph18>	I think there are some exceptions in English where 'ch' doesn't have a 't' in it and isn't like 'loch', but I can't remember them.
T 1603048935 18<26zaeph18>	Well, I guess there's Rorschach, but it's kinda like 'loch'.
T 1603048958 18<26zaeph18>	(Not counting 'school' either, since the onset has another consonant before it.)
