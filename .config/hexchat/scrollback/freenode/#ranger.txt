T 1562847908 18<22__monty__18>	vifon: TLDR the difference between a login shell and an interactive shell is?
T 1562847995 18<27vifon18>	Login shell is a shell you used to log in yourself.
T 1562848152 18<19crose18>	One of the main difference in practice, is the set of files which are sourced by the shell.
T 1562848165 18<19crose18>	For zsh, I think it's: https://0x0.st/zLR6.txt
T 1562848167 18<27vifon18>	Yes, indeed.
T 1562848283 18<19crose18>	For bash, it's more complex, but if you tweak `~/.bash_profile`, you can simplify it like this: https://0x0.st/zLRI.txt
T 1562848334 18<19crose18>	This is how I do it: https://github.com/lacygoill/config/blob/master/.bash_profile
T 1562848357 18<26zaeph18>	crose: I like your tables, they look fancy.
T 1562848378 18<19crose18>	Thanks, I've got a hacky Vim key binding to generate them.
T 1562848440 18<26zaeph18>	They look much better than my org-mode tables. :(
T 1562848491 18<26zaeph18>	…Although that's mostly due to the fact that your code can handle multicells.
T 1562850318 18<22__monty__18>	crose: I guess I meant more, how do I know in which quadrant I am (gonna be)?
T 1562850372 18<22__monty__18>	Like, what is a non-login interactive shell?
T 1562850398 18<22__monty__18>	And a non-interactive login shell for that matter.
T 1562850409 18<22__monty__18>	I assume I'm mostly working in interactive login shells?
T 1562850720 18<19crose18>	I'm not sure, and I don't have reviewed these concepts since a long time, but for me an interactive shell is a shell in which you can write commands, edit them (probably with readline key bindings), and run them by pressing Enter.
T 1562850726 18<19crose18>	When you run a bash script, the shell which is run to interpret the script is non-interactive: there's no way for you to interact with it (well, unless it asks you for some info, but that's limited).
T 1562850731 18<19crose18>	As for login shells, those are rare.
T 1562850734 18<19crose18>	For example, when you open a virtual console (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F1), the login process is running.
T 1562850738 18<19crose18>	It asks for your credentials, and if if they're good, it gives you a shell.
T 1562850741 18<19crose18>	I think this shell is a login shell.
T 1562850744 18<19crose18>	You can also start a login shell by passing the right flag to the command invoking the shell.
T 1562850747 18<19crose18>	For bash it's `-l` (i.e. `$ bash -l`).
T 1562850750 18<19crose18>	I think you're mostly working in interactive non-login shells.
T 1562851162 18<19crose18>	I've just found a way to determine whether you're in a login shell, from here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/237672/289772
T 1562851169 18<19crose18>	If the first character in the output of `echo $0` is a hyphen, then you're in an interactive login shell, otherwise you're in an interactive non-login shell.

T 1563217479 18<26zaeph18>	Wow, that is so cool: https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/ .
T 1563217894 18<26zaeph18>	I'm not sure what I find so appealing about tests and backtraces.  Maybe it's because I realise how stupid I've been not to use them in the past, pressing all the buttons or nudging stuff left and right until it worked rather than gaining an understanding of what was going on.
T 1563217952 18<26zaeph18>	I mean, debuggers aren't a panacea, and they aren't a substitute for understanding the code.  But when you're stumbling on a code-base that is so large and abstruse as org's, you'll be glad to have some tools to investigate the flow.
T 1563218480 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Hey folks, I asked over the weekend, but was offline for a bit so might have missed a reply. Sorry for asking twice; Is there a way to change / mask "user@host" in the ranger interface? I have some screen captures for work I'd like to do but don't want that info in them.
T 1563218517 18<26zaeph18>	ParallaxDenigrat: Hi.  Do you mean the user@host at the top left of the ranger window?
T 1563218537 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Yep, and if I could get rid of the usernam in the status bar by permissions that would be great too.
T 1563218547 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I'm guessing that would take a compile from scratch after a patch?
T 1563218550 18<26zaeph18>	If it's just for a screenshot, why not run it as root?
T 1563218560 18<26zaeph18>	You'd still have your host, but your username would be obfuscated.
T 1563218578 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	It's not just for one screenshot, I do lots of short screencasts for things like POC and stuff.
T 1563218602 18<22__monty__18>	You can hide the hostname with `set hostname_in_titlebar false`.
T 1563218604 18<26zaeph18>	Apparently there's a setting, `set hostname_in_titlebar true`
T 1563218605 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Honestly, I can switch to a root terminal each time if I have to, just thought I'd ask.
T 1563218608 18<26zaeph18>	Damn you __monty__ .
T 1563218611 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	wayt
T 1563218614 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	wat, seriously?
T 1563218625 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I freaking read every line of the config files hahaha
T 1563218631 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Well that's half way there. Thanks!
T 1563218671 18<26zaeph18>	Half way?  it also removes your host.
T 1563218684 18<26zaeph18>	Just try `:set hostname_in_titlebar false` in ranger.
T 1563218694 18<26zaeph18>	(You have to move the selection for it to refresh.)
T 1563218726 18<26zaeph18>	Oh, unless you meant the path to the visited folder.  You could always run something in /tmp/ if that bothers you.
T 1563218846 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Ahhh, think  I have to update
T 1563218865 18<26zaeph18>	Moving the selection didn't work?
T 1563218869 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I'm on 1.8.1 abd that doesn't seem to be an option.
T 1563218889 18<26zaeph18>	Let me try on my end.
T 1563218917 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: A kludge I just came up with, modify a colorscheme to have identical fg/bg colors in `context.in_titlebar` and it won't be visible?
T 1563218933 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah, doesn't exist in 1.8.1.
T 1563218967 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: But if I were you I'd probably just patch ranger so you can censor the user@host, setting it arbitrarily.
T 1563218967 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	__monty__ that's a great idea!
T 1563218994 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Honestly patching it is probably my plan, just wanted to check.
T 1563218997 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Thanks for the help!
T 1563219009 18<26zaeph18>	Any time!
T 1563219041 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: Oh, ha. Better yet.

T 1571527130 18<27Boobuigi18>	Thank goodness for idle_delay.  Without it set, ranger (even when its terminal window was not even visible) was using 5~7% CPU on my Raspberry Pi.
T 1571527258 18<27Boobuigi18>	Anyone thought about setting that by default?  I think the default is 1 millisecond, but the default rc.conf has it set to 2000?!
T 1571527291 18*	27Boobuigi is happy with 200 for now.
T 1571528068 18<27vifon18>	Boobuigi: Wait, so what's wrong with it being 2000 by default?
T 1571528194 18<27Boobuigi18>	Isn't that a two-second delay?  Maybe I'm confused.
T 1571528255 18<27Boobuigi18>	OK, maybe not.  I just tested it.
T 1571528305 18<27Boobuigi18>	Reading documentation, I figured it was the equivalent of calling 7sleep 2.000 in the main loop.
T 1571528353 18<22aRkedos18>	vifon is it possible to somehow extract the signal_name attribute within a function bound to a signal?
T 1571528358 18<27Boobuigi18>	I just set it to 20000, though (expecting up to twenty-second input lag), but there was no lag at all.
T 1571528384 18<27vifon18>	Boobuigi: I think it's about directory refresh.
T 1571528412 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: It was a few years since I worked directly with our signals, let me see…
T 1571528614 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: Did you try using the pass_signal parameter?
T 1571528635 18<27vifon18>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L267
T 1571528650 18<27vifon18>	It seems when it's set, your handler gets the signal object passed.
T 1571529006 18<22aRkedos18>	well I only work with an Instance of Signal which has no such attribute, I am still trying to merge my 2 methods for toggling the status and titlebar into one, but for that need to pass the respective widget object
T 1571529027 18<22aRkedos18>	thing is that if you bind a signal to that method the signal itselfs gets passed onto that function
T 1571529035 18<22aRkedos18>	so you cant pass the widget object
T 1571529071 18<27Boobuigi18>	vifon: Ah, that's all it applies to?  Thanks for the clarification.
T 1571529587 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: OK, I see now…  When you pass a function that takes any arguments, it gets enabled automatically.

T 1571529630 18<27vifon18>	Since you're new, I'm hesitant to suggest it, but closures could help here.
T 1571529639 18<27vifon18>	But it's a tricky concept for some.
T 1571529692 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: Basically the function you bind there would be:
T 1571529695 18<27vifon18>	   lambda sig: do_something(sig, widget)
T 1571529709 18<27vifon18>	Or a named equivalent (even better).

T 1582117075 18<20watered18>	vifon: I accidentally deleted all .files in my home directory
T 1582117076 18<20watered18>	but before it could be deleted I quit
T 1582117090 18<20watered18>	Now it shows the space freed up on df and i3-statusbar
T 1582117091 18<20watered18>	But the files are still there
T 1582117098 18<20watered18>	They are accessible
T 1582117109 18<20watered18>	How is that possible
T 1582117132 18<20watered18>	I'm scared they are marked for delete on next reboot or will be overwritten during new file transfers
T 1582117165 18<27vifon18>	Ranger probably started with one of the first directories there and didn't finish.
T 1582117182 18<27vifon18>	It probably deleted some files, just not all of them.
T 1582117196 18<27vifon18>	Do you have any backups?
T 1582117250 18<27vifon18>	If not, shutdown the system NOW, boot up some system from live USB and try tools like PhotoRec.
T 1582117286 18<20watered18>	vifon: But is it possible for such a thing to happen?
T 1582117376 18<27vifon18>	watered: Definitely.  Ranger cannot delete everything at once.  It goes file by file.
T 1582117393 18<20watered18>	vifon: But does it use the rm command?
T 1582117403 18<27vifon18>	Probably the unlink syscall.
T 1582117404 18<20watered18>	Everything I want seems to be there
T 1582117428 18<20watered18>	What is the actual name? 'unlink syscall'?
T 1582117442 18<20watered18>	is it possible to reverse that without rebooting?
T 1582117462 18<20watered18>	I'm worried if I reboot it will all go
T 1582117464 18<27vifon18>	Well, you can think about it as the rm command, yes.
T 1582117505 18<27vifon18>	watered: Rebooting won't make it worse than it is.
T 1582117741 18<20watered18>	vifon: I can see the files now and open them...! What if the link is in ram that's why I can still see them?
T 1582118238 18<27vifon18>	watered: Not possible.
T 1582118287 18<27vifon18>	The removed files that are still open are no longer visible.
T 1582118288 18<27vifon18>	The files you can see are fine.
