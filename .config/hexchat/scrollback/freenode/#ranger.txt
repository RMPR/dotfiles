T 1587660177 18<22__monty__18>	But it's a terminal feature. Imo ranger has no business modyfing people's configuration.

T 1587660269 18<22__monty__18>	It'd be like changing PATH or XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

T 1603047940 18<26zaeph18>	GermainZ: Not necessarily.  See, Italian is very consistent with its double consonants, and it does what you've just described.  In French, a lot of them are just random.
T 1603047977 18<26zaeph18>	Knowing Latin helps, but it severely undermines your ability to be fun at parties when you do.

T 1603048030 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: intuitively, I would pronounce the "p" as "d√©-v√©-lop-men", the "pp" as "d√©-v√©-lo-pe-men"
T 1603048120 18<26zaeph18>	See, that's an interesting behaviour because it's actually not reflected in the language.  It's like asking Anglophones whether they pronounce the 'l' in 'salmon', and a lot of them will tell you that they do.  However, it's absolutely not reflected in their usage, and it's purely subconscious.
T 1603048145 18<26zaeph18>	Same thing happens with double consonants in French: when you see them in something that is not quite right, you try to persuade yourself that they're different.
T 1603048199 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶But those conceptions are really challenged when you know both French and English.  'aggressive' in English has to 'g' because, otherwise, you'd be able to pronounce it as 'ay-gresive'.

T 1603048372 18<26zaeph18>	Yet, in French, we had to go ahead and write it 'litt√©rature'.

T 1603048424 18<26zaeph18>	(And, specifically, it's not 'lie' at the start, despite being stressed, exactly because it's a loan-word, and wanted to replicate the French way of saying it.)
T 1603048463 18<22__monty__18>	Hmm, we have vowel-shift but it doesn't apply when the next vowel's a soft(?) e.
T 1603048465 18<26zaeph18>	Like, they had to go out of their way to remove the double-t which is in the Latin 'litteratura'.
T 1603048520 18<22__monty__18>	Though in this particular word in dutch the e isn't actually soft.
T 1603048528 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: In 'literature', you don't even have an 'e'-sound: it gets elided with the 'r', which acts as an approximant link with the next-schwa (i.e. the 'soft e' you mentioned).
T 1603048550 18<22__monty__18>	Anyway, vowel shift has a bunch of exceptions when the vowel's followed by an e.

The tongue makes a glide which looks like a vowel, but it's the 'r' sound, which is an approximant, i.e., a consonantic sound that is close to a vowel in its voicing, but which still plays the r√¥le of a consonant in the syllable.

T 1612177047 18<26zaeph18>	I've been on top of things with org-mode's ML from October to December, which was nice.
T 1612177234 18<22__monty__18>	A rule to rewrite those horrible "via Org-roam, ... via Org-roam, ... via Org-roam" subjects would go a long way towards being able to skim through topics to decide whether or not they're important imo.

T 1612177301 18<26zaeph18>	I think I'm having trouble negotiating the transition to a multi-faceted life in FLOSS.  When it was just org-mode and me, I could manage.  Now that I'm fighting on many fronts, trying to keep trick of everything as diligently as I used to is becoming taxing.
T 1612177351 18<22__monty__18>	Why do you think I keep on top of ranger issues?
T 1612177369 18<22__monty__18>	If I didn't for a week and there was a sudden influx I'd be immediately swamped.

T 1612178536 18<26zaeph18>	The weird thing is that I don't feel that cold, and yes, I've lost some weight and must have fewer layers of insulation. ü§î

T 1612178644 18<26zaeph18>	Cycling gloves might work best.

T 1612178786 18<22__monty__18>	This is a good time to weed out the mailing lists btw. If there weren't any interesting mails for 3 months you shouldn't stay subscribed.

T 1613039788 18<22__monty__18>	I said take a look at the kitten to then base a script off of that if you want to stick with termite (don't recommend termite though tbh, didn't have a positive experience when I was testing a score of terminals for ranger).
T 1613039805 18<22__monty__18>	Kitty has "kittens" which are python scripts that extend its functionality.

T 1614428278 18<22__monty__18>	With nix you can wrap up the entire closure of a package on a computer with access to nixpkgs and then copy that over.
T 1614428311 18<22__monty__18>	And the Nixpkgs binary cached so far does not erase any binaries, so you don't even have to build most old versions.

T 1614428411 18<22__monty__18>	And generating the closure of packages kinda requires a network connection because nix fetches all the sources. And finding all of those to provide them offline is about as hard as manually collecting all the binaries or packages.

T 1614428686 18<22__monty__18>	If you write a program like ranger which has no dependencies except for the python interpreter you need to copy ranger (which is multiple files but is that really so much harder to copy than a single file?), then copy python, then copy python's deps, then copy python's deps' deps, then copy python's deps' deps' deps, etc. until there's no more deps.

T 1615318934 18<29lonelykid18>	I checked the code. it's not really using z at all. it's reading z data file and using it's own regex to match.

For example, The Elements of Typographic Style by Canadian typographer Robert Bringhurst recommends the spaced en dash ‚Äì like so ‚Äì and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash "belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography"

Honestly, I've gravitated toward polarising my parentheticals between commas and parenthesis (depending on the level of remoteness to the current context); em-dashes are just too confusing, especially in francophones circles where em-dashes live at a non-defined spot between commas and parentheses.

T 1617817915 18<28zidbon18>	It's not a big deal, just thought it would save some time.
T 1617817920 18<26zaeph18>	Uhm, from a text-based perspective, that would probably be possible, but I'm not sure how we'd support the colours.
T 1617817943 18<26zaeph18>	If you use Emacs, you could just open the dir and browse the files with proper syntax highlighting on another buffer.
T 1617818022 18<28zidbon18>	I might check that out.
T 1617818078 18<28zidbon18>	I haven't installed Emacs because I don't need all the features and it's a pretty big program.
T 1617818086 18<26zaeph18>	I guess we could probably write a custom script for scope.sh that would use a lib to only highlight the hex codes.
T 1617818120 18<28zidbon18>	Unfortunately that's out of my league.
T 1617818166 18<26zaeph18>	Maybe a VIM-based solution might work better?
T 1617818180 18<26zaeph18>	You could just jump to the next file by whichever order you deem fit in VIM.

T 1617818866 18<22__monty__18>	It's not a difficult change but I believe there were open issues still, probably performance.
T 1617818924 18<28zidbon18>	I just wonder if vimcat will use my vim plugins in the preview window.

T 1617822301 18<26zaeph18>	I'd just use re-search-backward with the regexp you've mentioned.
T 1617822324 18<22__monty__18>	Tmux functions, as in works, similarly to emacs in the default config.
T 1617822350 18<22__monty__18>	Tmux's search-up takes .* literally.
T 1617822364 18<26zaeph18>	And there is no re- prefixed function that'd allow regexp matching?
T 1617822378 18<22__monty__18>	I should really just configure it for vim keybindings.
T 1617822406 18<22__monty__18>	All the emacs bindings are super dumb.
T 1617822432 18<26zaeph18>	M-% is the default for forward regexp search in Emacs.
T 1617822438 18<26zaeph18>	(So, M-S-5.)

T 1617823070 18<22__monty__18>	In vim it's just / and ?, because search is important enough to warrant a single character. And why would you ever not use pattern-matching search? Just escape metacharacters if the need arises.
T 1617823086 18<22__monty__18>	Vim's the king of UX.
T 1617823091 18<26zaeph18>	Oh, sorry, M-% is for query replace.
T 1617823096 18<26zaeph18>	Search is C-s.
T 1617823113 18<22__monty__18>	Yeah, C-r doesn't allow patterns in tmux.
T 1617823163 18<26zaeph18>	In Emacs, we patch it with a fuzzy-matching, possibly-regexp matching.
T 1617823231 18<22__monty__18>	Of course, because this is an enormous PITA otherwise.
