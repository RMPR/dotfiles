T 1587235519 18<26zaeph18>	energizer: Because `r` is not `open`, but `run`.
T 1587235531 18<26zaeph18>	So, trashing is a sort of action to be run.
T 1587235655 18<29energizer18>	so if i press enter on a file it might get deleted?

T 1587235687 18<26zaeph18>	energizer: It's not the default action, normally.
T 1587235963 18<29energizer18>	ok
T 1587235989 18<26zaeph18>	You could remove the action if you don't want it.  You'd have to look into your rifle.conf.
T 1587236184 18<22__monty__18>	energizer: It shouldn't be the default action for anything. It's even under "run as binary" which has been the least prioritised action since ranger's inception.
T 1587236223 18<22__monty__18>	Keep in mind that the indices of that list are currently sometimes fucked. So if you try to run the action above trash you might end up trashing.
T 1587236240 18<29energizer18>	alright, sounds good. it's never happened to me, i just noticed it and was curious
T 1587236245 18<22__monty__18>	Also keep in mind that trash means "move to trash" it doesn't actually delete a file.

T 1587332643 18<22__monty__18>	Hardlink, look up inode, look up linked inode, done. Symlink, look up inode, read link, look up other inode by path, read contents.
T 1587332659 18<22__monty__18>	That's definitely gonna be more than a nanosecond.
T 1587332698 18<22__monty__18>	Symlinks are evaluated relative to the mount. So a symlink to a file outside the NFS share will point to that file on the user's system.

T 1587332711 18<26GermainZ18>	Yeah, a couple nanoseconds depending on the CPU :D

T 1587332875 18<22__monty__18>	A single lookup on an SSD is on the order of 0.5 ms.

T 1587333059 18<26GermainZ18>	But 0.5 ms is probably the worst case with modern SSDs being a fraction of that
T 1587333064 18<22__monty__18>	It's literally millions of nanoseconds.

T 1603046716 18<26GermainZ18>	I don't know if it's a good idea, but an interview prep book might give you a solid overview of base CS concepts and work up your problem solving skills

T 1603046813 18<22__monty__18>	I wouldn't expect them to be very thorough. But with zaeph's lack of... everything, I guess they could be a good sort of overview to identify topics you might want to look up.

T 1603046976 18<26zaeph18>	This book was recommended quite often, too: https://paste.xinu.at/i09P1S/
T 1603046977 18<22__monty__18>	Don't not-look at algorithms but don't focus on just algorithms.
T 1603046993 18<26GermainZ18>	I do think looking at and understanding algorithms is a good exercise for the brain. Don't memorize the algorithms or expect to use them, however
T 1603047070 18<26zaeph18>	The chief reason for my wanting to approach those big tomes is that I'd like to dive a a little lower with my languages.  Obviously, I need a GP, but with org-roam and the rust parser, I think I'm going to need more knowledge on the concepts.
T 1603047133 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: wanna laugh? https://0x0.st/iDu_.png
T 1603047137 18<26zaeph18>	It's one thing to hack something together with code you know and in a language that's hardly meant for optimisation (Elisp).  It's another to write a background process that would support threads and parallelisation.

T 1603047233 18<26GermainZ18>	I misread him hah
T 1603047239 18<26GermainZ18>	He's saying french isn't consistent. That's true
T 1603047248 18<26GermainZ18>	I don't know about comparing it to English tho, but maybe
T 1603047250 18<26zaeph18>	But less so than ENglish?
T 1603047282 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: mhm, perhaps
T 1603047286 18<26zaeph18>	I mean, it's an established fact that the link between graphemes and phonemes in English is horrendous, especially for French learners.
T 1603047292 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: both are extremely inconsistent IMO
T 1603047301 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: you're a native French speaker so highly biased tho
T 1603047324 18<26zaeph18>	Most definitely, yeah, but I did work on French as a general linguist, so I've put some distance with it.
T 1603047342 18<26zaeph18>	Double consonants in French are completely random.
T 1603047362 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶English is more consistent in that regard.  But re: vowels, English's a mess.
T 1603047389 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: same with things like eau(x)/o/√¥/au/aud/aus/etc
T 1603047418 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: the ambitiousness of silent letters in French definitely adds quite a lot of inconsistency that isn't there in English
T 1603047419 18<26zaeph18>	Not really, since they're all producing the same sound.  They're 'consistent' insofar as they always produce /o/.
T 1603047434 18<26zaeph18>	But 'ou' in English can have 4-5 different pronunciations.
T 1603047439 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: the inconsistency is specifically about the spelling vs pronunciation, isn't it?
T 1603047472 18<26zaeph18>	I took it more to mean 'a given grapheme can have multiple ways to be pronounced' rather than 'multiple graphemes can be mapped to a single phoneme'.
T 1603047484 18<26GermainZ18>	Ah
T 1603047489 18<26GermainZ18>	Perhaps so then
T 1603047501 18<26zaeph18>	In the former case, there's an element of unknown which can't be garnered from context.  In the latter case, it's consistent, just a PITA to learn.
T 1603047552 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: same with some things like ll in French, tho it might certainly be rarer
T 1603047556 18<26zaeph18>	(And by 'garnered from context', I mean what is immediately available to native speakers, i.e., not delving into etymology or nerdy stuff.)
T 1603047586 18<26zaeph18>	I'm pretty sure there have been studies on the topic, but it's typically the type of indicator that feels useless to define for a language.

T 1603047620 18<26GermainZ18>	Sure, it's just fun
T 1603047650 18<26zaeph18>	Lack of consistency between graphemes and phonemes are usually the results of reforms, and those can be so prompted by anything, but that doesn't make them replicate organic evolution.
T 1603047691 18<26zaeph18>	I'd love it if we could reform those sodding double consonants. -.-
T 1603047706 18<26zaeph18>	Seriously, think of all the unnecessary bullshit that you have to remember just because of that.
T 1603047730 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: the Acad√©mie already gets enough flack, imagine if they tried that. They'd all get guillotined
T 1603047744 18<26zaeph18>	See, I'm not sure if they would.
T 1603047749 18<26GermainZ18>	Mhm, I now realize it's a bit in bad taste given the recent incident. I didn't think of that
T 1603047801 18<26zaeph18>	It's one thing to spell 'nenuphar' (= lily pad) as 'nenufar', it's another to consider 'developement' and 'developpement' equivalent.
T 1603047820 18<26zaeph18>	GermainZ: I hadn't even thought of it, don't worry.

T 1603047848 18<26zaeph18>	But all the news here insisting on using 'beheaded' rather than 'assassinated' makes me gag a little.
T 1603047885 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: there is a slight different in pronunciation between the two, isn't there? Double consonants put slightly more emphasis on it 
T 1603047898 18<26zaeph18>	The vast majority of folks use it because they haven't seen the picture that was posted on Twitter, but as someone who did, it makes me super uncomfortable.
T 1603047925 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: I haven't seen the picture. What do you mean?
T 1603047940 18<26zaeph18>	GermainZ: Not necessarily.  See, Italian is very consistent with its double consonants, and it does what you've just described.  In French, a lot of them are just random.
T 1603047977 18<26zaeph18>	Knowing Latin helps, but it severely undermines your ability to be fun at parties when you do.
T 1603047992 18<26GermainZ18>	:D
T 1603048030 18<26GermainZ18>	zaeph: intuitively, I would pronounce the "p" as "d√©-v√©-lop-men", the "pp" as "d√©-v√©-lo-pe-men"
T 1603048120 18<26zaeph18>	See, that's an interesting behaviour because it's actually not reflected in the language.  It's like asking Anglophones whether they pronounce the 'l' in 'salmon', and a lot of them will tell you that they do.  However, it's absolutely not reflected in their usage, and it's purely subconscious.
T 1603048145 18<26zaeph18>	Same thing happens with double consonants in French: when you see them in something that is not quite right, you try to persuade yourself that they're different.
T 1603048199 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶But those conceptions are really challenged when you know both French and English.  'aggressive' in English has to 'g' because, otherwise, you'd be able to pronounce it as 'ay-gresive'.

T 1603048220 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶But French has 'agressif'.

T 1603048254 18<26zaeph18>	Oh most definitely.
T 1603048351 18<26zaeph18>	Also, that vowel-shift-when-double-consonants in English isn't even consistant.
T 1603048361 18<26zaeph18>	You say 'literature', not 'lie-terature'.
T 1603048372 18<26zaeph18>	Yet, in French, we had to go ahead and write it 'litt√©rature'.
T 1603048405 18<26GermainZ18>	Yeah
T 1603048424 18<26zaeph18>	(And, specifically, it's not 'lie' at the start, despite being stressed, exactly because it's a loan-word, and wanted to replicate the French way of saying it.)
T 1603048463 18<22__monty__18>	Hmm, we have vowel-shift but it doesn't apply when the next vowel's a soft(?) e.
T 1603048465 18<26zaeph18>	Like, they had to go out of their way to remove the double-t which is in the Latin 'litteratura'.
T 1603048520 18<22__monty__18>	Though in this particular word in dutch the e isn't actually soft.
T 1603048528 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: In 'literature', you don't even have an 'e'-sound: it gets elided with the 'r', which acts as an approximant link with the next-schwa (i.e. the 'soft e' you mentioned).
T 1603048550 18<22__monty__18>	Anyway, vowel shift has a bunch of exceptions when the vowel's followed by an e.
T 1603048581 18<26zaeph18>	A'ight, that's enough phonology for tonight. :p
T 1603048614 18<22__monty__18>	zaeph: Hmm, not sure I agree completely. Sure, some say litrature, but lit-eh-rature is definitely common afaict.
T 1603048630 18<22__monty__18>	No stress on the eh but it's definitely there.

T 1603048763 18<26GermainZ18>	That sounded quite French to me
T 1603048791 18<22__monty__18>	Nah, the eh sounds like uh or even ah.

T 1603048814 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: It's definitely not a shwa, there.  The tongue makes a glide which looks like a vowel, but it's the 'r' sound, which is an approximant, i.e., a consonantic sound that is close to a vowel in its voicing, but which still plays the r√¥le of a consonant in the syllable.

T 1603048889 18<26GermainZ18>	Ah, makes sense
T 1603048913 18<26zaeph18>	I think there are some exceptions in English where 'ch' doesn't have a 't' in it and isn't like 'loch', but I can't remember them.

T 1612713864 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: I lived in another big city before, and it was pretty similar.  No optical fiber near my hometown, though.

T 1612713985 18<27vifon18>	I feel personally attacked.  https://lobste.rs/s/tcqizo/architecture_md#c_0ycxwt
T 1612713990 18<22__monty__18>	Like I said, large cities aren't a good point of reference. It's exactly the kind of thing that makes the democrats unpopular in most of the US.
T 1612714011 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: I know; I wasn't going against you.
T 1612714154 18<22__monty__18>	You better not, that'd be harrassment of the sexual variety!

T 1612715078 18<26zaeph18>	Why does it always have to be about my being gay?  Can't I just be insufferable *in spite* of being gay?
T 1612715754 18<26zaeph18>	Holy *shit*.  This is what it feels like to be wearing a pair of shoes which are *actually* close to the shape of your feet.
T 1612715797 18<26zaeph18>	I spent a couple of hours at another shop today (higher quality that what I'd been first), and they have different last, which is how they call the different shapes off which the models are based.
T 1612715863 18<26zaeph18>	I found something that is actually pretty damn close to my own shape, and whilst the leather will need to be broken in (more than my previous model, based on the more advanced stitching), I have enough wiggle room with the lacing to accommodate the extra millimeters that I'm going to win.
T 1612715875 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: Mostly for you ‚Üë.

T 1612715942 18<26GermainZ18>	how so?
T 1612715948 18<26zaeph18>	People who work until then hardly have the time for going shopping.
T 1612715955 18<26GermainZ18>	they usually open past 6pm on weekdays?
T 1612715983 18<26zaeph18>	Generally until 7pm-8pm; but it has a *massive* impact in how people can go check the stores.
T 1612715992 18<26zaeph18>	Because of the 6pm curfew, people get anxious at 4:30pm.
T 1612716010 18<26GermainZ18>	Ah I see
T 1612716029 18<26GermainZ18>	In Switzerland I'm used to both mostly closing at 6 anyway‚Ä¶
T 1612716049 18<26GermainZ18>	though I'm lucky, the little market next to me closes at 8 instead
T 1612716060 18<26zaeph18>	It's one thing for things to close at 6pm; it's another to be *back home* by 6pm.
T 1612716070 18<26zaeph18>	Especially when your employer does jack shit when it comes to adapting their closing times.
T 1612716075 18<26GermainZ18>	True, I didn't think about that

T 1612716214 18<26zaeph18>	They're burgundy; the lighting isn't giving them justicew.
T 1612717385 18<22__monty__18>	zaeph: You should look at running shoes, like Altra's "Foot Shape" last (I guess?).
T 1612717409 18<22__monty__18>	I don't think leather shoes will ever actually accomodate feet well.
T 1612717443 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: Well, I wanted to have leather shoes, so that much wasn't negotiable. :)
T 1612717446 18<22__monty__18>	It ruins the aesthetic.
T 1612717490 18<22__monty__18>	Reconsidered the boots?
T 1612717523 18<22__monty__18>	These ones have very minimal brogueing and they're not derbies either. How many shoes are you gonna be buying?
T 1612717538 18<26zaeph18>	Nope: I found and tried two models that will be amazing, but they weren't available in the colour I wanted.  I'll be buying the two pairs once I get paid.
T 1612717594 18<26zaeph18>	I'd planned on 4: 1 pair of Oxfords, 1 pair of Derbies, and 2 pair of boots (more or less rugged).  Eventually, I wanted to get a 2nd pair of Oxfords in burgundy, which I ended up buying now.
T 1612717616 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶And I think I'm all set.  I might get some sneakers for the summers, but that's about it.
T 1612717683 18<24eyJhb18>	so.... Since no one else asked this
T 1612717692 18<26zaeph18>	I'm hoping to keep this collection for at least a couple of years, so we'll see!
T 1612717694 18<24eyJhb18>	Why the hell do you have so many USB things connected eyJhb ?

T 1612717738 18<24eyJhb18>	Sorry
T 1612717789 18<26zaeph18>	eyJhb: It's because I use my laptop as my main PC: https://paste.xinu.at/8X8gbM/
T 1612717806 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶So, I have to keep it connected to webcam, mic, keeb, mouse, etc.
T 1612717834 18<24eyJhb18>	I see, but I raise you having.. Three. Mouse, keyboard and USB hub with nothing in it
T 1612717834 18<26zaeph18>	The hub is mostly there to have a convenient on/off switch for communication devices, but also to reset the keeb/mouse when they're misbehaving.
T 1612717855 18<24eyJhb18>	What is there besides the the web, mic, keeb, mouse?
T 1612717860 18<24eyJhb18>	microphone
T 1612717880 18<24eyJhb18>	Then there is one left, I count 6
T 1612717893 18<26zaeph18>	In order: webcam, mic, keeb, mouse, empty, empty, unconnected micro-USB, unconnected USB-C.
T 1612717924 18<24eyJhb18>	Fair, quite a clean setup. I cannot compare atm.
T 1612717948 18<26zaeph18>	I use another one of those hubs for managing my external drives on my server.  They're quite convenient, although they do cost 20 EUR.
T 1612717970 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶But the first one I've bought has been holding on perfectly for 2.5y now.

T 1612718058 18<26zaeph18>	‚Ä¶Also, I clearly wouldn't have bought any of this on a uni-student budget.  I've been lucky to have a paying job for a couple of years, which is the only way I could justify those spendings, along the standing-desk.
T 1612718094 18<26zaeph18>	Thank you for emptying that glass before taking the photo, you dweeb.
T 1612718109 18<24eyJhb18>	It has been standing there since this morning

T 1612718126 18<26zaeph18>	eyJhb: Yup, USB-3.  They're for infrequent access and seeding, so I don't need them up 100%.
T 1612718211 18<26zaeph18>	I guess it's time for a 6-month review of the standing desk, btw: I'd say I use my desk standing 30% of my day (especially in the morning and during meetings), and it's really convenient to be able to have a 'table' (rather than a desk) that you can raise.  Peak laziness is raising the desk to blow on your soup more easily whilst watching something.

T 1612812219 18<26zaeph18>	Sure; thanks!
T 1612812311 18<22__monty__18>	Note that both of these methods are likely to increase the length of your lace ends slightly.
T 1612812347 18<26zaeph18>	Well, when you don't have the length, you better have the smarts.
T 1612812396 18<22__monty__18>	I used straight lacing on sneakers that had a lace snap. Over time they did warp a bit. The lacing had a tendency to loosen/tighten asymmetrically.

T 1614427397 18<20blawiz18>	is it usually hard to install a package on an outdated/offline computer?
T 1614427475 18<22__monty__18>	Yes.
T 1614427481 18<22__monty__18>	Because of recursive dependencies.
T 1614427491 18<22__monty__18>	And because most repositories drop old stuff.
T 1614427508 18<22__monty__18>	Nixpkgs is kind of uniquely adept at both of these things though.
T 1614427517 18<22__monty__18>	But the UX is kinda terrible.
T 1614427572 18<20blawiz18>	:[
T 1614427629 18<20blawiz18>	maybe easiest to try to compile it, but i guess maybe similar problems with that
T 1614427663 18<20blawiz18>	would static distro help here maybe?
T 1614428216 18<22__monty__18>	A bit but only for dependencies that are used for their shared libraries.
T 1614428238 18<22__monty__18>	That doesn't include data like fonts. Or programs that are shelled out to.
T 1614428278 18<22__monty__18>	With nix you can wrap up the entire closure of a package on a computer with access to nixpkgs and then copy that over.
T 1614428311 18<22__monty__18>	And the Nixpkgs binary cached so far does not erase any binaries, so you don't even have to build most old versions.
T 1614428345 18<22__monty__18>	Accessing the binary cached does require a network connection of course. Unless you can get a multi TB offline copy...
T 1614428411 18<22__monty__18>	And generating the closure of packages kinda requires a network connection because nix fetches all the sources. And finding all of those to provide them offline is about as hard as manually collecting all the binaries or packages.
T 1614428484 18<20blawiz18>	hmhmhm...
T 1614428500 18<20blawiz18>	kinda surprising its this hard eh
T 1614428557 18<22__monty__18>	Not really once you understand how complex writing software is.
T 1614428610 18<22__monty__18>	If you write a C program without dependencies, or with only C-library dependencies and you compile it statically then it's just one file to copy.
T 1614428686 18<22__monty__18>	If you write a program like ranger which has no dependencies except for the python interpreter you need to copy ranger (which is multiple files but is that really so much harder to copy than a single file?), then copy python, then copy python's deps, then copy python's deps' deps, then copy python's deps' deps' deps, etc. until there's no more deps.
T 1614428691 18<20blawiz18>	yeah, thats nice
T 1614428774 18<26zaeph18>	'Wait, it's all deps?'
T 1614428777 18<26zaeph18>	'Always has been.'
T 1614428885 18<22__monty__18>	It's deps all the way down.
T 1614428907 18<22__monty__18>	But some package formats aren't actually honest about their deps.
T 1614428921 18<22__monty__18>	This is what Nixpkgs has revolutionized.

T 1614459455 18<26zaeph18>	You need %s to designate the target.

T 1614459501 18<22__monty__18>	Yep.
T 1614459503 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah.

T 1614459517 18<26zaeph18>	Shouldn't be too hard to patch, though, depending on the use-case?
T 1614459531 18<22__monty__18>	Yeah, zaeph's a tit, you don't need to pass an argument.
T 1614459533 18<26zaeph18>	I think it actually assumes %s, judging by the error message that the file/dir already exists.
T 1614459556 18<26zaeph18>	__monty__: Well excuse~ me for trying to help.

T 1614459610 18<22__monty__18>	bdju: `map t shell touch %s`
T 1614459618 18<26zaeph18>	Why are we not doing this by default, though?  Do we need shielding?
T 1614459639 18<22__monty__18>	Because it's not something that makes sense imo.
T 1614459668 18<28bdju18>	__monty__: that worked great!
T 1614459677 18<28bdju18>	thanks
T 1614459685 18<26zaeph18>	It feels weird to be taking the name of a script, but not fully porting its capabilities, especially for something as abstractly co-opted as `touching`.
T 1614459691 18<22__monty__18>	mtime may be a bad reflection of the real last time a file was modified but why make it an even worse reflection?
T 1614459718 18<22__monty__18>	Touch is the logical name since "mkfile" doesn't exist.
T 1614459724 18<22__monty__18>	bdju: Np.
T 1614459747 18<26zaeph18>	I'm gonna make 'touchd' a thing.
T 1614459765 18<26zaeph18>	It's a bit of a vocational habit for me.
T 1614459780 18<22__monty__18>	To be clear. I'm not opposed to someone implementing all of touch's functionality as long as nothing breaks.
T 1614459786 18<22__monty__18>	Which is impossible afaict.
T 1614459812 18<22__monty__18>	Because we don't require escaping filenames so "touch -mtime blah" would create a file called "-mtime blah".
T 1614459813 18<26zaeph18>	Are we never offloading to shell for file manipulations?  Is it all implemented via Python?
T 1614459824 18<22__monty__18>	Even file copying is.
T 1614459829 18<26zaeph18>	Nice~.
T 1614459831 18<22__monty__18>	I think that should answer the question.
