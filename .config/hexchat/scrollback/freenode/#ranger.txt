T 1562847908 18<22__monty__18>	vifon: TLDR the difference between a login shell and an interactive shell is?
T 1562847995 18<27vifon18>	Login shell is a shell you used to log in yourself.
T 1562848152 18<19crose18>	One of the main difference in practice, is the set of files which are sourced by the shell.
T 1562848165 18<19crose18>	For zsh, I think it's: https://0x0.st/zLR6.txt
T 1562848167 18<27vifon18>	Yes, indeed.
T 1562848283 18<19crose18>	For bash, it's more complex, but if you tweak `~/.bash_profile`, you can simplify it like this: https://0x0.st/zLRI.txt
T 1562848334 18<19crose18>	This is how I do it: https://github.com/lacygoill/config/blob/master/.bash_profile
T 1562848357 18<26zaeph18>	crose: I like your tables, they look fancy.
T 1562848378 18<19crose18>	Thanks, I've got a hacky Vim key binding to generate them.
T 1562848440 18<26zaeph18>	They look much better than my org-mode tables. :(
T 1562848491 18<26zaeph18>	…Although that's mostly due to the fact that your code can handle multicells.
T 1562850318 18<22__monty__18>	crose: I guess I meant more, how do I know in which quadrant I am (gonna be)?
T 1562850372 18<22__monty__18>	Like, what is a non-login interactive shell?
T 1562850398 18<22__monty__18>	And a non-interactive login shell for that matter.
T 1562850409 18<22__monty__18>	I assume I'm mostly working in interactive login shells?
T 1562850720 18<19crose18>	I'm not sure, and I don't have reviewed these concepts since a long time, but for me an interactive shell is a shell in which you can write commands, edit them (probably with readline key bindings), and run them by pressing Enter.
T 1562850726 18<19crose18>	When you run a bash script, the shell which is run to interpret the script is non-interactive: there's no way for you to interact with it (well, unless it asks you for some info, but that's limited).
T 1562850731 18<19crose18>	As for login shells, those are rare.
T 1562850734 18<19crose18>	For example, when you open a virtual console (e.g. Ctrl-Alt-F1), the login process is running.
T 1562850738 18<19crose18>	It asks for your credentials, and if if they're good, it gives you a shell.
T 1562850741 18<19crose18>	I think this shell is a login shell.
T 1562850744 18<19crose18>	You can also start a login shell by passing the right flag to the command invoking the shell.
T 1562850747 18<19crose18>	For bash it's `-l` (i.e. `$ bash -l`).
T 1562850750 18<19crose18>	I think you're mostly working in interactive non-login shells.
T 1562851162 18<19crose18>	I've just found a way to determine whether you're in a login shell, from here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/237672/289772
T 1562851169 18<19crose18>	If the first character in the output of `echo $0` is a hyphen, then you're in an interactive login shell, otherwise you're in an interactive non-login shell.

T 1563217479 18<26zaeph18>	Wow, that is so cool: https://alphapapa.github.io/emacs-package-dev-handbook/ .
T 1563217894 18<26zaeph18>	I'm not sure what I find so appealing about tests and backtraces.  Maybe it's because I realise how stupid I've been not to use them in the past, pressing all the buttons or nudging stuff left and right until it worked rather than gaining an understanding of what was going on.
T 1563217952 18<26zaeph18>	I mean, debuggers aren't a panacea, and they aren't a substitute for understanding the code.  But when you're stumbling on a code-base that is so large and abstruse as org's, you'll be glad to have some tools to investigate the flow.
T 1563218480 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Hey folks, I asked over the weekend, but was offline for a bit so might have missed a reply. Sorry for asking twice; Is there a way to change / mask "user@host" in the ranger interface? I have some screen captures for work I'd like to do but don't want that info in them.
T 1563218517 18<26zaeph18>	ParallaxDenigrat: Hi.  Do you mean the user@host at the top left of the ranger window?
T 1563218537 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Yep, and if I could get rid of the usernam in the status bar by permissions that would be great too.
T 1563218547 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I'm guessing that would take a compile from scratch after a patch?
T 1563218550 18<26zaeph18>	If it's just for a screenshot, why not run it as root?
T 1563218560 18<26zaeph18>	You'd still have your host, but your username would be obfuscated.
T 1563218578 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	It's not just for one screenshot, I do lots of short screencasts for things like POC and stuff.
T 1563218602 18<22__monty__18>	You can hide the hostname with `set hostname_in_titlebar false`.
T 1563218604 18<26zaeph18>	Apparently there's a setting, `set hostname_in_titlebar true`
T 1563218605 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Honestly, I can switch to a root terminal each time if I have to, just thought I'd ask.
T 1563218608 18<26zaeph18>	Damn you __monty__ .
T 1563218611 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	wayt
T 1563218614 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	wat, seriously?
T 1563218625 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I freaking read every line of the config files hahaha
T 1563218631 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Well that's half way there. Thanks!
T 1563218671 18<26zaeph18>	Half way?  it also removes your host.
T 1563218684 18<26zaeph18>	Just try `:set hostname_in_titlebar false` in ranger.
T 1563218694 18<26zaeph18>	(You have to move the selection for it to refresh.)
T 1563218726 18<26zaeph18>	Oh, unless you meant the path to the visited folder.  You could always run something in /tmp/ if that bothers you.
T 1563218846 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Ahhh, think  I have to update
T 1563218865 18<26zaeph18>	Moving the selection didn't work?
T 1563218869 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	I'm on 1.8.1 abd that doesn't seem to be an option.
T 1563218889 18<26zaeph18>	Let me try on my end.
T 1563218917 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: A kludge I just came up with, modify a colorscheme to have identical fg/bg colors in `context.in_titlebar` and it won't be visible?
T 1563218933 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah, doesn't exist in 1.8.1.
T 1563218967 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: But if I were you I'd probably just patch ranger so you can censor the user@host, setting it arbitrarily.
T 1563218967 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	__monty__ that's a great idea!
T 1563218994 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Honestly patching it is probably my plan, just wanted to check.
T 1563218997 18<27ParallaxDenigrat18>	Thanks for the help!
T 1563219009 18<26zaeph18>	Any time!
T 1563219041 18<22__monty__18>	ParallaxDenigrat: Oh, ha. Better yet.

T 1571527130 18<27Boobuigi18>	Thank goodness for idle_delay.  Without it set, ranger (even when its terminal window was not even visible) was using 5~7% CPU on my Raspberry Pi.
T 1571527258 18<27Boobuigi18>	Anyone thought about setting that by default?  I think the default is 1 millisecond, but the default rc.conf has it set to 2000?!
T 1571527291 18*	27Boobuigi is happy with 200 for now.
T 1571528068 18<27vifon18>	Boobuigi: Wait, so what's wrong with it being 2000 by default?
T 1571528194 18<27Boobuigi18>	Isn't that a two-second delay?  Maybe I'm confused.
T 1571528255 18<27Boobuigi18>	OK, maybe not.  I just tested it.
T 1571528305 18<27Boobuigi18>	Reading documentation, I figured it was the equivalent of calling 7sleep 2.000 in the main loop.
T 1571528353 18<22aRkedos18>	vifon is it possible to somehow extract the signal_name attribute within a function bound to a signal?
T 1571528358 18<27Boobuigi18>	I just set it to 20000, though (expecting up to twenty-second input lag), but there was no lag at all.
T 1571528384 18<27vifon18>	Boobuigi: I think it's about directory refresh.
T 1571528412 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: It was a few years since I worked directly with our signals, let me see…
T 1571528614 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: Did you try using the pass_signal parameter?
T 1571528635 18<27vifon18>	https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/ranger/ext/signals.py#L267
T 1571528650 18<27vifon18>	It seems when it's set, your handler gets the signal object passed.
T 1571529006 18<22aRkedos18>	well I only work with an Instance of Signal which has no such attribute, I am still trying to merge my 2 methods for toggling the status and titlebar into one, but for that need to pass the respective widget object
T 1571529027 18<22aRkedos18>	thing is that if you bind a signal to that method the signal itselfs gets passed onto that function
T 1571529035 18<22aRkedos18>	so you cant pass the widget object
T 1571529071 18<27Boobuigi18>	vifon: Ah, that's all it applies to?  Thanks for the clarification.
T 1571529587 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: OK, I see now…  When you pass a function that takes any arguments, it gets enabled automatically.

T 1571529630 18<27vifon18>	Since you're new, I'm hesitant to suggest it, but closures could help here.
T 1571529639 18<27vifon18>	But it's a tricky concept for some.
T 1571529692 18<27vifon18>	aRkedos: Basically the function you bind there would be:
T 1571529695 18<27vifon18>	   lambda sig: do_something(sig, widget)
T 1571529709 18<27vifon18>	Or a named equivalent (even better).

T 1582117132 18<20watered18>	I'm scared they are marked for delete on next reboot or will be overwritten during new file transfers
T 1582117165 18<27vifon18>	Ranger probably started with one of the first directories there and didn't finish.
T 1582117182 18<27vifon18>	It probably deleted some files, just not all of them.
T 1582117196 18<27vifon18>	Do you have any backups?
T 1582117250 18<27vifon18>	If not, shutdown the system NOW, boot up some system from live USB and try tools like PhotoRec.

T 1582929680 18<29maerwald18>	Since ranger is writte in python... I assume it handles filepaths as utf-8 and not bytestring on unix?
T 1582929715 18<22__monty__18>	It's messy.
T 1582929765 18<22__monty__18>	Fwiw I haven't run into issues with that yet though.
T 1582929783 18<29maerwald18>	Well, the one thing a filemanager should get right is handling filepaths :P
T 1582929799 18<22__monty__18>	And it does. I'm just always surprised it does.
T 1582929807 18<29maerwald18>	I was looking at hunter (written in rust), but it seems buggy
T 1582929827 18<22__monty__18>	You should give ranger a shot before you knock it.
T 1582929829 18<29maerwald18>	Though rusts OsString should be sorta safe, although it makes no effort to not have developers convert to and from utf-8 randomly
T 1582929886 18<22__monty__18>	Pretending filenames are utf-8 doesn't really do any harm if it's just for presentation.
T 1582929908 18<29maerwald18>	yeah, but it's likely they are shoe-horned that way into the syscalls
T 1582929956 18<22__monty__18>	Not sure what you suspect might go wrong? If you pass the bits unaltered there's no problem.
T 1582929981 18<22__monty__18>	I dare you to find bugs related to the handling of filenames in ranger.
T 1582929990 18<29maerwald18>	I mean, once they were converted to utf-8, the information of the original encoding is lost and it is pure luck whether passing it to a syscall does what you think
T 1582929995 18<22__monty__18>	Either we get a satisfied user or we get a good bug report : )
T 1582930009 18<22__monty__18>	There's no converting.
T 1582930023 18<22__monty__18>	You try to read random bytes as if they're utf-8.
T 1582930026 18<29maerwald18>	that was my question... are they kept as bytes or utf-8
T 1582930047 18<22__monty__18>	They're kept as strings for the UI.
T 1582930069 18<22__monty__18>	To date I've only had to fix a single bug because of this and it had nothing to do with syscalls.

T 1584703220 18<22__monty__18>	Weird assumption.
T 1584703233 18<22__monty__18>	That's not how rc files work. Which is what rc.conf is based on.
T 1584703328 18<26zaeph18>	It's because it completely flew over my head that rc.conf worked like a traditional rc-file.  I just assumed that it stood for 'ranger config'.

T 1584712624 18<26zaeph18>	Always hate debugging race conditions.
T 1584712678 18<26zaeph18>	Traced it down to a program that forks to the background without providing any means to get the PID.
T 1584712860 18<26zaeph18>	Basically, I'm generating a screenshot for i3lock to use, and after running i3lock, I need to run two other functions *whilst* i3lock is running, one of which is a cleanup for the screenshot.
T 1584712900 18<26zaeph18>	I could just make i3lock not fork to the background, but I need the other function (the one which isn't a cleanup) to run after i3lock has been started.  Such a mess.
T 1584712968 18<26zaeph18>	Maybe I could get it to run before the lock.  Uhm...  O'boy, here I go coding again!
T 1584713165 18<22__monty__18>	Weird, returning the child's PID is literally what fork does.
T 1584713357 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah.  Well, since I'm safeguarding against running concurrent versions of i3lock, I can just pgrep the pid right after running it, but it isn't Beautiful™.
T 1584713400 18<22__monty__18>	How are you forking that you can't get the pid though?
T 1584713424 18<26zaeph18>	i3lock's default behaviour is to fork without giving you the PID.
T 1584713440 18<26zaeph18>	There's an option to have it not-fork, in which case you can bg it and retrieve the PID as you would normally with $!.
T 1584713560 18<26zaeph18>	But the problem is that it's a script meant to be run automatically on suspend with systemd, so I can't have it stay alive during--
T 1584713569 18<26zaeph18>	OK, I'll bottomline it: it's a clusterfuck.
T 1584713625 18<26zaeph18>	All I wanted is to have the same script be used for manual and automatic suspend when closing the lid. -.-
T 1584713759 18<26zaeph18>	But it works, so I won't complain too much.
T 1584713914 18<22__monty__18>	Can't you simply fork the non-forking version of i3lock?
T 1584713937 18<22__monty__18>	I.e., call `fork i3lock`.
T 1584714028 18<26zaeph18>	I could, but I also wanted my script to handle the clean-up (like removing the screenshot), but for that, the script needs to track the status of the i3lock process, which hangs systemd's suspend.
T 1584714075 18<26zaeph18>	The right way to do it would be to have a resume script handle the cleanup, but I can't be arsed passing all files that instructions to another process, like the path to the screenshot and all that.
T 1584714113 18<22__monty__18>	And why don't you just write a systemd service and invoke it manually with systemctl suspend?
T 1584714188 18<26zaeph18>	Because I use a wrapper around 'systemctl suspend' to allow me to cancel it if I don't want to suspend after all, and which makes heavy use of dunst's notifications.
T 1584714255 18<26zaeph18>	This whole lock-suspend procedure is one of the earliest thing I've wrote on that computer, and it's become quite complex.  It went through revisions to streamline the interactions, but in cases like this, it's pretty rough.
T 1584714287 18<22__monty__18>	How about the service starting a timer that triggers the actual service?
T 1584714333 18<26zaeph18>	And making it cancellable?  Could work.  I'd just have to isolate the cancelling element of the main locking script.
T 1584714367 18<22__monty__18>	Well cancelling would just be stopping the timer.
T 1584714377 18<26zaeph18>	It's actually the main problem: it's the script itself that handles the cancellation, not a wrapper.  It's done fairly reliably with PIDs, though.
T 1584714394 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah, I guess it could work like this. :)

T 1585918125 18<27mahe18>	hi rangers! can somebody who's familiar with the code please help me get started with a modification: where does ranger interpret single keypresses (as defined via 'map' commands) in the main view?
T 1585918198 18<22__monty__18>	Maybe tell us what you want to achieve first. To avoid XY.
T 1585918287 18<27mahe18>	I want to try masking those 'map' keybindings behind a different mode (that has to be toggled), so that I can implement a true type-ahead (aka search-as-you-type) default behavior for navigation. As the 'find' and 'scout' commands sadly don't cut it for me.
T 1585918326 18<26zaeph18>	Have you tried our lord and saviour `map f chain move to=0;console scout -efit%space`?
T 1585918380 18<26zaeph18>	And have you looked at the different options for scout?  There's plenty of room for customisation.
T 1585918481 18<22__monty__18>	mahe: Have you tried :travel?
T 1585918531 18<22__monty__18>	And yeah, scout is pretty flexible, make sure it doesn't satisfy your needs.
T 1585918621 18<27mahe18>	I tried travel and some options for scout but my problem is: I want to select files/folders by typing per default. When I open ranger, when I enter a folder etc. I don't wanna leave this navigation mode until I explicitly leave this mode. Also I want arrow keys to still work while in type-ahead mode etc.
T 1585918651 18<22__monty__18>	Ok, sounds like a cool mode.
T 1585918656 18<27mahe18>	similar to how midnight commander works when you disable its command bar per default
T 1585918666 18<26zaeph18>	So, you want a scout which, upon entering a new folder, fires up scout again as long as the mode is toggled?
T 1585918671 18<26zaeph18>	I agree, that sounds pretty interesting.
T 1585918674 18<22__monty__18>	I'd look at the other modes first. Rather than key parsing.
T 1585918674 18<26zaeph18>	HERESY!
T 1585918688 18<26zaeph18>	He mentioned our arch-enemy!

T 1585918771 18<27mahe18>	anyway, where in the code would I look for the key press interpretation in the normal view?
T 1585918806 18<27mahe18>	is it ui.py:handle_key() and ui.py:press() ?
T 1585918825 18<27mahe18>	*gui/ui.py
T 1585918987 18<26zaeph18>	mahe: It's beyond my expertise, and I can't look it up right now.  best of luck, though.

T 1586720133 18<26zaeph18>	I think your assumptions are correct about the types of notes, although I'd put a caveat on the last type.  The bulk of your notes are going to be atomic notes which refer to concepts.
T 1586720188 18<26zaeph18>	Then, you have writing-driven notes which aim to articulate your other notes into a cohesive subject.  Have a possible outline for a topic you'd like to write?  It'd go in a note like this.  A revision to that outline?  Just create a new note and call it v2.
T 1586720211 18<26zaeph18>	As for your last type, the book makes it clear that you shouldn't have more than one of those note.  It's the index I was talking about.

T 1586720578 18<26zaeph18>	Your second type seems to be about saying why two atomics notes can be related, correct?
T 1586720672 18<22__monty__18>	Yeah, it's clarifying a link.
T 1586720695 18<26zaeph18>	It's because I consider those to be part of the same type as the outline driven notes.
T 1586720700 18<22__monty__18>	But the manuscript preparation notes that collect a list of identifiers are what I call outlines.
T 1586720705 18<26zaeph18>	In other words, it's either atomic or connective.
T 1586720726 18<26zaeph18>	Connective can just be two atomic notes, or it can be writing-driven
T 1586720735 18<26zaeph18>	That's how I understood it anyway.
T 1586720768 18<22__monty__18>	I don't see why you'd merge these. If you take my graph metaphor it becomes clearer how it can make sense to treat them differently.

T 1586720838 18<26zaeph18>	Yeah, I think that's the crux of the problem: we shouldn't be really thinking about types.
T 1586720851 18<26zaeph18>	As long as you're keeping your notes simple and connected, that's kind of the only thing you need.

T 1586721811 18<22__monty__18>	I assume this means you're supposed to add links manually and add them over time when you happen to think of them?

T 1586722008 18<22__monty__18>	No, you need to use `-e` without `-A`.
T 1586722019 18<22__monty__18>	And you can't always use the name you used to install.
T 1586722034 18<22__monty__18>	You need to use the name rather than the "attribute name".

T 1586723575 18<26zaeph18>	Win key is Super, Capslock is Hyper.
T 1586723584 18<26zaeph18>	CapsLock as Hyper, I find it very useful.
T 1586723633 18<26zaeph18>	Left side of the keyboard shifted with Hyper handles system stuff (lock, busy-mode, lid-sleep-inhibit, etc.), right side if app specific.

T 1586724044 18<26zaeph18>	Oh yeah, I remember thinking I should modify it.
T 1586724066 18<26zaeph18>	I think it's because I wanted to turn it into another alt.
T 1586724076 18<26zaeph18>	But no, it makes sense.  I already use Alt_R for dead keys.
T 1586724077 18<22__monty__18>	Three alts?
T 1586724102 18<26zaeph18>	Nah, Alt_R is for AltGr.  I use it for French diacritics.
T 1586724115 18<26zaeph18>	I tried doing them with Compose, but it really slowed me down.
T 1586724121 18<26zaeph18>	And it was infuriating when it misfired.
T 1586724317 18<22__monty__18>	Fair, I guess. Though couldn't you map the exact dead-key combinations to compose? For example if you use ralt+u to type ù, you could have compose-u mean the same thing.
T 1586724384 18<26zaeph18>	You could, but that'd prevent combinations with two letters.
T 1586724401 18<26zaeph18>	So, then, before you know it, you have to type compose u u.
T 1586724522 18<22__monty__18>	True.
T 1586724692 18<26zaeph18>	All right, from kitty: …
T 1586724694 18<26zaeph18>	Yay!
T 1586724707 18<26zaeph18>	I still don't like change.
T 1586724753 18<26zaeph18>	And now, I'm thinking; 'What if I get a computer without that extra key next time?'
T 1586724753 18<26zaeph18>	Useless question.
T 1586724889 18<22__monty__18>	Feel free not to use kitty. It's a great terminal though.
T 1586724945 18<26zaeph18>	It feels more extensible.  Terminator feels like a relic of the past, but it does the job.
T 1586725093 18<26zaeph18>	The weird thing is that kitty only does that for Multi_key.
T 1586725096 18<26zaeph18>	Menu works fine.
T 1586725540 18<26zaeph18>	Do I really want to lose my sanity on this… Mh...
T 1586725796 18<26zaeph18>	Welp, it's in C.  Not gonna get really far with that.
T 1586726364 18<26zaeph18>	Fuck this. ♪┌|°з°|┘♪
T 1586726538 18<22__monty__18>	zaeph: Side note, wayland's coming and xcape probably won't work there anyway.
T 1586726543 18<22__monty__18>	It's probably a hack on a hack.
T 1586726558 18<26zaeph18>	It is.
T 1586726566 18<26zaeph18>	*sigh* It's a losing battle.
T 1586726573 18<22__monty__18>	I know that doesn't fix your problem but maybe it's not actually a reasonable solution in the first place.
T 1586726581 18<26zaeph18>	I think you're right.
T 1586726613 18<26zaeph18>	And the misfires are unbearable too.  It's like a bad relationship: I just can't let go.
T 1586726762 18<22__monty__18>	Seems like a habit.
T 1586726765 18<26zaeph18>	Like, I even use it for mapping Ctrl_R to M-x in Emacs, and even that only works 95% of the time.
T 1586726792 18<26zaeph18>	All right, I'll remove it.
T 1586726802 18<26zaeph18>	I don't think I even use Ctrl_R on its own.
T 1586727147 18<26zaeph18>	There, remapped Ctrl_R.  I'll probably be mad for a week, but it'll be for the best.
T 1586727431 18<22__monty__18>	👍
T 1586727448 18<22__monty__18>	Though my rctrl isn't exactly comfortable to type.
T 1586727458 18<26zaeph18>	Neither is mine, but I'm used to it for Emacs.
T 1586727474 18<26zaeph18>	And since it' too tough to chord, using it for a single action is all right.
T 1586727483 18<26zaeph18>	I use it for <menu> elsewhere.
T 1586727516 18<26zaeph18>	Oh nice, kitty also has `hold shift and click link to open`.
T 1586727522 18<26zaeph18>	It's with `open_url_modifiers shift`
T 1586727564 18<26zaeph18>	I think I could get used to kitty.
T 1586727632 18<26zaeph18>	Could I took a gander at your config?  I'm browsing the wiki for some syntactical elements, like how to cycle variables, but it's a bit complicated to find.
T 1586727646 18<26zaeph18>	Or is it on GH?
T 1586727660 18<22__monty__18>	It could be.

T 1586727685 18<26zaeph18>	I'm trying to find how to cycle the bell.
T 1586727687 18<22__monty__18>	Basically just the kitty_mod+o binding. And some changes to the hash pattern.
T 1586727689 18<26zaeph18>	'Cause it's useful on weechat sometimes.
T 1586727896 18<26zaeph18>	Uhm, not sure if you can actually cycle a value.  Don't see any way to handle conditionals.
T 1586728548 18<22__monty__18>	Maybe writing a kitten would be the kitty way to add this functionality?
T 1586728562 18<26zaeph18>	Probably.  I'm a little tired and not very efficient tonight.
