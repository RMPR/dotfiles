T 1575837786 18<27tairikuookami18>	you're using gnome.  the gnome bug reporting tool is garbage.  it's failing.  sure, if it actually *worked* you could expect it to file a bug on your behalf..  it's broken.  so it's up to you to file the bug report on the things that actually matter, which is more audacity and calendar and much less the bug-reporting-tool.
T 1575838849 18<26Khaytsus18>	the problem is not the 'gnome' bug reporting tool.  First off, it's not gnome. Second, yes, sometimes it wants to install a ton of debug stuff to get more data and it fails.  And yes, if you can reproduce the issue just log it manually.  Rather than it being automatic, with no context.

T 1577997253 18<29knaccc18>	yeah finding the release notes is one thing. interpreting the significance of them is an entirely different ball game
T 1577997266 18<29knaccc18>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions

T 1577997366 18<20sfranken18>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
T 1577997392 18<20sfranken18>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
T 1577997468 18<29knaccc18>	ok thanks
T 1577997626 18<20sfranken18>	Same goes for CentOS though
T 1577997674 18<29knaccc18>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
T 1577997697 18<29knaccc18>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
T 1577997739 18<20sfranken18>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
T 1577997745 18<20sfranken18>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
T 1577997779 18<20sfranken18>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
T 1577997797 18<20sfranken18>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
T 1577997818 18<29knaccc18>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using
T 1577997837 18<20sfranken18>	And some driver backports

T 1578000364 18<24prussian18>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.

T 1586035019 18<29LRB18>	Anybody know of a method to disable the disabling of a mouse pad while typing? There's apparently a bug in the xfce4 that's shipping with Fedora 31. I'm just looking for a command or something to directly interact with the settings.

T 1586035864 18<29LRB18>	I'm not really sure what you mean. I'm not seeing that in xfce4-settings-editor or xfce4-settings-manager

T 1586632195 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: If you installed from Fedora F31 GA KDE Plasma media or respin media... it doesn't included LibreOffice.  I just verified that by booting an .iso in a KVM VM.

T 1586632419 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: LibreOffice does come preinstalled on the GNOME spin... and maybe a few other spins, but not the KDE Plasma one.
T 1586632441 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: The reason for that is that KDE has their own office suite named Caligra so that's what they have pre-installed.
T 1586632468 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: Some of the spins/DEs aimed and lower resource usage might have GNUmeric and Abiword.

T 1586718553 18<20plarsen18>	greatgatsby, having C# on RHEL is a benefit to Red Hat - it breaks one of the last platform barriers. It's also why Microsoft is hard at work breaking the same barriers to Windows. Both sides want _all_ workloads to be compatible with their platform.

T 1587299266 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Maybe try using pkcon which is a CLI for PackageKit, which is the component behind GNOME Software (if you observe noticably better perf you could exclude PK and focus on the GNOME Software, otherwise it could be a problem in either of these)
T 1587299343 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Note that apparently (per Wikipedia) PK might use hawkey/librepo directly (i.e. not via DNF), meaning it's very possible there are differences between both as you observe.
T 1587299444 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: One example you could check: Support for Zchunk added in F30 <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Zchunk_Metadata>. This improved perf immensely for me with DNF, but I'm not sure if it's supported by PK/GNOME Software -- so if not it could explain what you're observing.

T 1587299873 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Assuming it's a subprocess, and nondeterministic, and the app retries repeatedly, then with a little imagination it could also explain your issue (I know, lots of assumptions, but just sayin' ;P)

T 1587300322 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Also use pkmon (while using GNOME Software and pkcon) to monitor PackageKit events/transactions.

Not just between distributions, but within them. It makes it possible for you to pick the right tool for the right project

If pgAdmin 3 is strictly a web application (which I think it is), then it would explain why it doesn't appear in "app stores" (it requires server components that don't fit the traditional app model).
T 1587433160 18<28tnelis18>	gambl0re: This would be a good fit for a flatpak, but I don't see any on Flathub, you might be out-of-luck if you want the latest version outside of third-party repos (Copr has a couple you might want to check out <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=pgadmin>).
