T 1603108505 18<19amharris18>	Hi, folks!  I've used (GNU/)Linux for quite a long time overall but have been away from using it on my own machines for a fair number of years, (aside from when I have scriptable, headless instances).  Got Fedora (33 beta) spun up on a new mini PC [ASUS PN50 - AMD Renior (4800U)] and it's all running smoothly, but I'm having an odd problem I'm trying to figure out.
T 1603108666 18<19fedora_sec18>	What's the odd problem?
T 1603108691 18<19amharris18>	In short, whether at high loads or idling, the system will eventually and intermittently crash to a black screen.  I'm not sure if it's GNOME, but it seems to be a fairly messy state.  If I press the power button (to go into suspend), it'll then spit out errors in a text interface, but I basically have to hard reset [at least so far].
T 1603108707 18<19fedora_sec18>	Are you using KDE?
T 1603108716 18<19amharris18>	Nope.  GNOME; bog-standard Workstation.
T 1603108725 18<19amharris18>	on Wayland (and Btrfs).
T 1603108749 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: can you switch to tty and check if there is any kernel message / trace ?
T 1603108752 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's a problem with Renior, given it's still fairly recent, or if it's 33; or a combination.
T 1603108780 18<19fedora_sec18>	Ah wayland. Does the computer automatically lock itself? Because I was using Parrot OS and when it tried to lock itself, it would freeze because it didn't have the right thing to lock itself, so I switched off the auto locking and switched the rendering too
T 1603108869 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Yeah, I tried to jump into the logs and system logs sometimes throw a warning of access.  I don't think I've ever 'main'-ed GNOME 3 (and it's been so long since I've played around with a new setup; last Linux workstation was on Debian Wheezy with OpenBox ...yup!).
T 1603108890 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: it also looks like you system doesn't die, it's just the screen going black so you can check the syslog for those
T 1603108896 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: I'm at work right now, but I'll get as much info as I can when I get home.
T 1603108916 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: also: use the sysrq to restart the system if it happens, don't use the power button (but you need to enable the sysrq to do so, they are disabled by default)
T 1603108918 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: hehe, hence my little explanation above. ;-)
T 1603108975 18<26Khaytsus18>	If not suggested yet, try the Xorg (Classic) login vs Wayland.
T 1603108980 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: to enable: echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' > /etc/sysctl.d/sysrq.conf
T 1603109004 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's relevant at all but having never really had more of a business-orientated system before, I didn't really think about 1.2V for the DRAM and got 1.35V 3200MHz memory instead (but not at JEDEC spec and only XMP); listed as compatible but it clocks it down to 2666MHz at 1.2V.  Not sure if that's relevant at all.
T 1603109065 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: that would be a point for the hardware vendor, not for Fedora people I suppose, we can only speculate on that topic :)
T 1603109110 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Albeit a touch embarrassing, I've never actually used SysRq.  Though I get the basics of what it does, what's the reason you're suggesting/requesting I use it to restart the system?
T 1603109135 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: True, true.  Just throwing it out there in case there's an "aha!  I've seen/heard about this before." :-)
T 1603109173 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: with the sysrq equence s u b, you will sync the cache to disk (s), remount everything read only (u), and then reset (b). This is a way of shutting down with less risk of corrupting the file system
T 1603109450 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Ah, fab—just what I like. :-)  I hope that worst case it'd just be a few bits being flipped and not a risk of a borked install [with hard resets]. >.<
T 1603109516 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: without sysrq the chances of having a borked install are much lower I'd say
T 1603109567 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Do you mean 'with'?

I got a new GPU - switched from an nVidia to AMD; I have removed all the nvidia diver packages, and have installed the xorg-x11-drv-amdgpu package. However, for some reason, when I try to log in (to the console, no DM installed) I am immediately logged back out now.
T 1612205692 18<26quippy18>	hi I was wondering if anybody knew how to get a application icon to display in the dock when you manually create a .desktop file to install an app? It shows up in the Gnome Overlay / Activities pane, but not the dock on the left hand side for some reason
T 1612205732 18<28Xenorites18>	I did the package uninstall/reinstall from a chroot, since graphical console completely froze on boot with the GPU installed initially

T 1612205797 18<28Xenorites18>	quippy: you need to add applications to the dock yourself; it's not done automatically
T 1612205818 18<26quippy18>	oh no sorry, I mean that when it is added, the icon image is not displayed
T 1612205837 18<26quippy18>	but the image is displayed normally in the Activities overview

T 1612206444 18<22faern18>	I'm running Fedora 33 workstation on an Intel NUC as a media PC. A problem I'm having is that it stops responding to network requests a short while after I turn off the monitor it's connected to. How can I stop it from doing that?
T 1612206456 18<22faern18>	I have masked the sleep.target hibernate.target and most others.
T 1612206472 18<22faern18>	And I have tried running a constant systemd-inhibit invocation in a tmux shell.
T 1612206496 18<28Xenorites18>	faern: Fedora does not sleep natively
T 1612206501 18<22faern18>	And according to the power LED it's still on. But shortly after turning off the monitor it stops allowing SSH and other network requests.
T 1612206508 18<28Xenorites18>	have you configured the firewall correctly?
T 1612206511 18<22faern18>	It also does not react to keyboard presses.
T 1612206523 18<22faern18>	The keyboard does nothing until I turn the monitor back on.
T 1612206543 18<28Xenorites18>	which NUC is this?
T 1612206551 18<22faern18>	Xenorites: It lets me in over ssh and is reachable over other protocols while the monitor is on. So I don't think it's the firewall.
T 1612206551 18<28Xenorites18>	it sounds like some kind of hardware sleep, or something
T 1612206584 18<22faern18>	It's the NUC8i3BEH2
T 1612206633 18<22faern18>	Maybe I should check out the UEFI and see if there is any setting there.
T 1612206692 18<28Xenorites18>	yeah, see if there is some kind of power-saving enabled
T 1612206710 18<28Xenorites18>	the behavior you are describing is strange
T 1612206724 18<26quippy18>	yeah it could be Xenorites , that's an idea

T 1612209528 18<20cmurf18>	because on my older NUC that powers down USB and it doesn't ever come back up until i reboot, and thus i lose the keyboard
T 1612209560 18<20cmurf18>	granted, i've applied 1/2 dozen UEFI firmware updates for that NUC since I last tested USB and powertop stuff
T 1612209705 18<22faern18>	cmurf: Nope. Nothing like that. A fairly standard install of ff33 workstation and not much done to it.
T 1612209774 18<20cmurf18>	Xenorites: Fedora 33 defaults to Btrfs, where / is on a subvolume named 'root' and /home is on a subvolume named "home"
T 1612209803 18<22faern18>	So far the problem of not being able to SSH into it went away after disabling CEC. But the wireless keyboard is still dead.

T 1612209954 18<20cmurf18>	wireless keyboard means bluetooth so it sounds like bluetooth is dropping the keyboard for some reason - that's harder to troubleshoot
T 1612210017 18<20cmurf18>	i've got an apple bluetooth mouse that's super flakey on linux, it just vanishes randomly no matter what laptop it's paired with, and then comes back
T 1612210019 18<20cmurf18>	but that's not your problem because, the keyboard isn't coming back
T 1612210042 18<20cmurf18>	it sounds power save related though

T 1612350434 18<19[Enrico]18>	nfsv4 is designed to integrate with kerberos and has its own system of ACLs (NVFSv4ACLs which nobody supports). It's been a total disaster from the design point of view, a massive failure and the world would be a better place without it to be honest :)
T 1612350461 18<19[Enrico]18>	I assume in theory it was done to integrate better with Windows systems.... but now Windows dropped NFS support anyway

T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	Hello, I'd like to report a kind of bug (I guess) on fedora-workstation 33 in conjunction with keepassxc: the issue is already being discussed there: https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/5608 . In short, the search field in keepassxc doesn't take any typing input unless keppasxc is started through the terminal with "keepassxc -plateform wayland". The problem is ongoing since about October 2020. For me the

T 1612730720 18<20cmurf18>	it does restart on startup already so making it do it again isn't gonna fix things
T 1612730735 18<20cmurf18>	it starts from initramfs, logs, restarts from disk, logs indefinitely
T 1612730758 18<20cmurf18>	so if it's getting stuck on every reboot that's not good
T 1612730762 18<20cmurf18>	this is f33? or rawhide?

T 1612730804 18<20cmurf18>	it just gets stuck?
T 1612730933 18<25jakelazaroff18>	to give a little more context, these are servers on digitalocean from an image i'm building with packer. so basically what happens is a server boots up, gets provisioned, the disk gets saved as an image, and then that becomes the template for new servers

T 1612809490 18<25Amgine[m]18>	Aha! and then I get to blame Steve Jobs...
T 1612809502 18<20cmurf18>	if it doesn't show the change then that's the problem
T 1612809507 18<25Amgine[m]18>	Yes, the change is there.
T 1612809522 18<20cmurf18>	ok hmm, well that grubenv file is accepting the change at least
T 1612809576 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah on macs, the thing we use on Fedora for /boot/efi is not the real EFI System partition
T 1612809584 18<20cmurf18>	but a small HFS+ partition
T 1612809598 18<26slop18>	macs. /me washes hands.
T 1612809609 18<20cmurf18>	the reason is for mactel-boot stuff, so that you see a pretty Fedora logo when you boot with option key at the startup chime
T 1612809613 18<20cmurf18>	:D
T 1612809633 18<25Amgine[m]18>	<nods> I wiped this one so it is only Fedora, which may be the issue?
T 1612809655 18<20cmurf18>	basically there are some files on that HFS+ faux-ESP that make Apple firmware think Fedora's GRUB is actually macos haha
T 1612809661 18<20cmurf18>	but anyway...
T 1612809669 18<26slop18>	hey I saw a post on reddit about about the splash screen for system updates performed via gnome. guys, ive got to tell you. thats a great move. Its something that my parents and other non technical people are COMFORTABLE with.
T 1612809671 18<20cmurf18>	no i don't think so, this is all self contained to Fedora
T 1612809689 18<26slop18>	a lot better than me telling my 70+ year old parents ok open a terminal. now
T 1612809716 18<20cmurf18>	yeah they just get updates automatically really, out of the box
T 1612809728 18<25Amgine[m]18>	kk. Well, thanks for the quick solution, and I will keep you apprised if there are future similar behaviors.
T 1612809731 18<26slop18>	Its a step in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded/outside of technical people updates. and making updates LESS scary so theya re applied.
T 1612809736 18<20cmurf18>	you just reboot and once every week or two (sometimes more often due to firefox or a kernel security fix) you get updates on the reboot
T 1612809742 18<26slop18>	^^
T 1612809779 18<20cmurf18>	Amgine[m]: yeah because the kernel package is responsible for writing that that conf file, and then also updating the grub environment file
T 1612809787 18<20coppice18>	slop: you do realise that it was people who are 70+ who developed the opening of terminal windows?
T 1612809886 18<22akik18>	cmurf: on an 2011 imac, the efi system partition is a normal vfat partition. there's an installer bug that makes it so that you can't install the boot loader in the installer
T 1612809925 18<20cmurf18>	akik: there is a real FAT32 ESP but Apple only uses it for firmware update staging
T 1612809932 18<20cmurf18>	they don't use it for booting and neither does Fedora
T 1612809942 18<22akik18>	cmurf: my machine uses it for booting
T 1612809950 18<26slop18>	coppice, not my farming parents. they didnt have an email address until it was required. I tell them theres NOTHING they can break on fedora that we can either figure out or reload.
T 1612809955 18<22akik18>	i.e. /boot/efi/EFI/fedora is in there
T 1612809972 18<20cmurf18>	akik: lsblk -f | fpaste
T 1612809998 18<20cmurf18>	because the installer, if it knows it's on a mac, will create /boot/efi on HFS+, it will not reuse the FAT32 ESP
T 1612810024 18<20cmurf18>	there is a bug in the f33 installer where it creates both FAT32 and HFS+ partitions, but only uses the HFS+ one for /boot/efi
T 1612810071 18<20cmurf18>	the unused FAT32 volume is left untouched - forever ghosted
T 1612810101 18<22akik18>	cmurf: that's where the installer goes wrong. it should just use the existing esp
T 1612810199 18<22akik18>	cmurf: here's the lsblk https://paste.centos.org/view/7c9d7479
T 1612810257 18<22akik18>	maybe the difference is that i'm using apfs and not hfs
T 1612810273 18<22akik18>	for the macos partition
T 1612810900 18<20cmurf18>	akik: did you modify this after installation?

T 1612811004 18<22akik18>	cmurf: no it contains some apple stuff. one thing that i just now remembers was that i use that other boot loader per default, refind
T 1612811024 18<20cmurf18>	that's interesting because Apple had used a 200M FAT32 ESP for a very long time, since the start of EFI with x86 macs
T 1612811056 18<20cmurf18>	Soo it must be that whatever does the test for "is it a mac" isn't working with newer macs? HUH
T 1612811061 18<20cmurf18>	but you said this is a 2011 mac
T 1612811076 18<22akik18>	cmurf: yes
T 1612811090 18<20cmurf18>	my 2009 and 2012 macs both behave the way i've described though

T 1612811106 18<22akik18>	and it's probably going out of support soon
T 1612811109 18<20cmurf18>	the installer doesn't use FAT32 ESP, it'll only use HFS+ for /boot/efi
T 1612811117 18<22akik18>	why's that?
T 1612811125 18<22akik18>	i have apple's stuff in there

T 1612811156 18<20cmurf18>	like i said earlier, it's part of mactel-boot stuff to make it easier for mac users
T 1612811166 18<22akik18>	i can paste the contents if you want
T 1612811185 18<20cmurf18>	originally Fedora also appeared in the Startup panel, but i think Apple broke that part and now only the built-in firmware Boot Manager shows Fedora
T 1612811227 18<20cmurf18>	did you use Custom partitioning? or Advanced-Custom?
T 1612811243 18<22akik18>	if i try to install fedora or centos on it, i'm just getting some weird error like efi system partition can't be of type esp

T 1612811264 18<22akik18>	then i need to unselect the install boot loader in the installer and after install, install it
T 1612811292 18<20cmurf18>	oh ok so you're just being stubborn and want to do things your way rather than the installer's way :D

T 1612811560 18<19foxide18>	You don't even need to do that. FAT32 EFI works just fine, Apple EFI looks for the fallback bootloader same as UEFI implementations.

T 1612811629 18<20cmurf18>	Because Apple's firmware ignores it except as a final fallback volume

T 1612986870 18<19Terminus18>	i just think switching to whatever new way of doing things is better than trying to insist on doing it the old way. like lots of people moaned about systemd. i just started working on understanding systemd instead and completely forgot about sysvinit.

T 1612987227 18<25genevino18>	especially on static ip setups it's basically pointless anyways, so why bother with it?
T 1612987348 18<22elmiko18>	ok, so i think what happened here is that i manually added an ip address because the server in question kept getting an old cached value instead of the value i wanted from the dhcp server, and when i did that i failed to add the route. but, i guess my next question would be, is there an nmcli command to drop the dhcp cache?
T 1612987385 18<22elmiko18>	the nic in question kept ending up with both ip addresses (the cached and the new one)

T 1612987741 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: Why bother?  Because you might be configuring a whole host of advanced networking things that require a separate tool each... and THAT is where nm simplies it.  I don't know that NM is that much "bloat".
T 1612987779 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: But it is ok if YOU don't like it... but others who use more advanced features of it probably love it for how it simplified so much for them.
T 1612987783 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: that's not how problems reduction works. i generally start with the most simple thing and work my way up, not the other way around.
T 1612987812 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: i'm perfectly fine with it on a setup i have physical access to, but on a server i want zero surprises.
T 1612987872 18<25genevino18>	in fact one of the reasons why i heavily use netbsd and alpine for servers.
T 1612987883 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: The problem nm was trying to solve (in my opinion) was to have one tool to configure everything network related... and it was especially nightmarish when you work with a number of different distros.  Not only does nm solve it for one system, but all of the distros that use it (if setup properly).

T 1612987965 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: That would be true if you still continue to use the 14 other tools that are no longer necessary.
T 1612987973 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: it still *IS* nightmarish. i happen to have just written a wrapper script that circumvents dependency on the systemctl command. that's basically exactly the same thing. people trying to force a standard on you without realizing that reality differs.
T 1612987991 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: But so far as new standards go, I'm guessing nm didn't reinvent the backend of configuration, they just speak it... but I'm guessing.

T 1613072158 18<20cmurf18>	if you use Custom, there is a partition scheme popup with a Btrfs preset, if you choose that and click the blue text above it to create partitions automatically you'll get the same layout as the "Automatic" install path used on desktop installers

T 1613072245 18<20cmurf18>	yeah you can do that in Custom or Advanced-Custom

T 1613072345 18<20cmurf18>	i'll try it - you do want raid1 metadata, even for raid0 data
T 1613072387 18<29fyksen18>	Ahh, okey. Thanks. I will read a bit up about metadata on btrfs.
T 1613072391 18<20cmurf18>	while the system won't survive a full device failure, the file system itself can survive and self-heal still, if there are things like bad sectors, dropped/redirected writes
T 1613072401 18<29fyksen18>	But it makes sense
T 1613072457 18<20cmurf18>	yeah if there's any kind of isolated/limited trouble with one of the devices, at least the fs survives - but of course data is a far larger payload so chances are that's what gets hit by such corruptions
T 1613072467 18<20cmurf18>	and in the raid0 case it pretty much means trouble
T 1613072497 18<20cmurf18>	it really just depends on what the corruption hits, but btrfs will tell you that :D

T 1613074530 18<20cmurf18>	rustysysdev_: very minor point, i probably wouldn't use xfs for /boot because in very rare cases it's possible for it to be inconsistent from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613074559 18<20cmurf18>	bootloader can't do journal replay is what it comes down to
T 1613074603 18<20cmurf18>	xfs in particular only guarantees the journal contains metadata updates on fsync, not that the journal is flushed
T 1613074705 18<28rustysysdev_18>	cmurf, Interesting, and thanks! Its seems to be the default for Fedora33 when generating a new BRTFS configuration via the GUI i wonder why.. Ill look into changing it!

T 1613074746 18<20cmurf18>	i wonder if that's part of Server related kickstart stuff
T 1613074793 18<20cmurf18>	i think originally it was ext4 /boot and xfs /
T 1613074805 18<20cmurf18>	maybe it got changed to xfs for both
T 1613074827 18<20cmurf18>	and now with btrfs preset it defers to the Server kickstart for /boot
T 1613074854 18<28rustysysdev_18>	not sure, but if the bootloader cannot indeed do replay then it indeed should be changed.. I wonder if the bootloader can somehow do replay now?
T 1613074864 18<20cmurf18>	nope
T 1613074868 18<20cmurf18>	not for ext4 either
T 1613074964 18<20cmurf18>	it's just to complicated to have two different places to maintain journal replay code, so far no one is interested in doing it
T 1613074997 18<20cmurf18>	in no particular order, use FAT, ext2, ext4 with journaling disabled, or btrfs
T 1613075003 18<26slop18>	This community here is so nice. Ive been in other channels that people are very..... impatient? snipe-ish?
T 1613075026 18<28rustysysdev_18>	I have been using netinstaller for everything since fedora 21.. possibly before then.. but cannot remember. I remember it used to provision ext2, and then ext4, and now even on my 32 install its xfs
T 1613075035 18<20cmurf18>	i can't remember either
T 1613075065 18<20cmurf18>	yeah almost no chance you run into this, because also dracut does an FIFREEZE/FITHAW on /boot on xfs
T 1613075085 18<20cmurf18>	that flushes the journal to the fs, so that the bootloader has a consistent view
T 1613075111 18<20cmurf18>	so this teeny tiny issue probably won't ever happen in the usual case
T 1613075120 18<20cmurf18>	s/usual case/normal usage/
T 1613075195 18<20cmurf18>	also systemd does a umount of /boot which also flushes journal to fs metadata
T 1613075272 18<28rustysysdev_18>	so not a huge issue, in that the file system should never see an unclean state.. but probably better to switch.. I think ill move it to ext4 with journaling disabled.
T 1613075273 18<20cmurf18>	so the only time you might get in trouble is: (a) modify anything related to the current default boot files, such as /boot/loader/entries files (b) reboot -f or sysrq+b or crash
T 1613075289 18<20cmurf18>	not a huge issue

T 1613076318 18<20cmurf18>	i dunno the whole story but someone filed a bug, they had /boot as a directory on an XFS /
T 1613076341 18<20cmurf18>	and something was consistently preventing the usual behavior of / being remounted ro
T 1613076364 18<20cmurf18>	/ can't be unmounted on a reboot, but it should be remounted ro, which also flushes the journal
T 1613076410 18<20cmurf18>	even though it wasn't remounted ro, the system was rebooted anyway rather than hang (which we could have a lot of legit debate about what to do about this)
T 1613076437 18<20cmurf18>	but the consequence was, the bootloader didn't see the changes in /boot - it saw a 0 byte grub.cfg following kernel upgrades
T 1613076443 18<26slop18>	haha :) very impressed no joke
T 1613076448 18<20cmurf18>	so it face planted
T 1613076487 18<20cmurf18>	and if all you did was boot from a usb rescue, and mount the file system, journal replay happened, the grub.cfg was fine
T 1613076508 18<20cmurf18>	but if you mounted root ro,nologreplay - it was 0 bytes
T 1613076534 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah, fixing it was just mount normally and then reboot, grub works now
T 1613076557 18<20cmurf18>	but the key thing is you want to prevent these things in the first place :)
T 1613076563 18<26slop18>	nice, I wouldve missed that completely. nice work
T 1613076573 18<20cmurf18>	oh it drove me nuts
T 1613076600 18<20cmurf18>	and it turns into a bit of head butting upstream, like the bootloader doing the wrong thing, the file system doing the wrong thing, on and on
T 1613076608 18<20cmurf18>	you know, finger pointing
T 1613076637 18<20cmurf18>	as it turns out, everyone is right but that doesn't solve the problem
T 1613076720 18<24d9k18>	if that would happen with bls you would just not get the entry for the next kernel i think
T 1613076738 18<24d9k18>	since all the bits are generated from the conf at /loader and grub.cfg is untouched
T 1613076739 18<20cmurf18>	i think so
T 1613076742 18<24d9k18>	should be untouched..
T 1613076745 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076747 18<20cmurf18>	good point
T 1613076766 18<20cmurf18>	this might be totally obsoleted by bls
T 1613076769 18<26slop18>	cmurf, I get that completely -  thank you
T 1613076819 18<20cmurf18>	the last write should be to write a new bls file, and it should either be present or not
T 1613076850 18<20cmurf18>	from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613076857 18<24d9k18>	if a new grub.cfg is moved in its place to replace it and only the metadata update happened then you would be in the same situation
T 1613076884 18<24d9k18>	even if it is the same data just written over
T 1613076896 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076907 18<20cmurf18>	in that case it's involving rename
T 1613076932 18<24d9k18>	chattr +i grub.cfg problem solved hehe
T 1613076951 18<20cmurf18>	so you can end up with 0 length files because the journal contains the rename, not yet flushed to the fs itself which is all the bootloader sees
T 1613076969 18<24d9k18>	yeah
T 1613076987 18<20cmurf18>	in practice, nothing changes grub.cfg anymore but a sysadmin
T 1613077106 18<20cmurf18>	maybe one day i'll try to sabotage this again and see if i can break anything
T 1613077136 18<20cmurf18>	dm-log-writes would be a better way to do it
T 1613077179 18<20cmurf18>	it breaks down all changes so we can see whether a crash at each step results in an undesirable/unmanagable view of the filesystem

T 1613085398 18<20cmurf18>	this is one reason why i use subvolumes/rw snapshots to isolate things
T 1613085419 18<20cmurf18>	it's still shared trees for everything but that file tree
T 1613085470 18<20cmurf18>	but if the corruption can be trimmed out by just deleting a subvolume, it just dereferences nodes that contain the problem rather than cow
T 1613085483 18<20cmurf18>	if it read it, to cow, it'd hit the corruption and faceplant
T 1613085488 18<20cmurf18>	just like in qemu
T 1613085507 18<20cmurf18>	but oh ignore what i just wrote - the root file system would go read only because of this
T 1613085540 18<20cmurf18>	the question is whether the write time tree check stopped it before it was written out, and i think the answer to that is yes

T 1613085795 18<20cmurf18>	well the backing file is memory so this can be that bug hmm
T 1613085807 18<24d9k18>	i think so
T 1613085822 18<24d9k18>	or what you mean
T 1613085829 18<20cmurf18>	so
T 1613085868 18<20cmurf18>	consider a more persistent virt-manager setup, raw backing file, and you use a cache mode that supports o_direct like none
T 1613085879 18<20cmurf18>	or directsync
T 1613085907 18<20cmurf18>	and if that raw backing file is on btrfs, and is datacow, your raw backing file is being checksummed
T 1613085945 18<20cmurf18>	o_direct allows file systems to do inflight changes of buffered data, there's no enforcement for stable writes
T 1613085982 18<20cmurf18>	so we get a write and checksum for the write in the raw file; and a subsequent inflight write changes the data does not update the csum and we start seeing csum errors
T 1613086044 18<20cmurf18>	part of why the default is nodatacow for raw/qcow2 files on btrfs with libvirt, and the default cache mode is writeback
T 1613086048 18<20cmurf18>	problem doesn't happen with either of those

T 1613114512 18<22mkowalski_18>	Question about reporting such a problem - dmesg for `input` shows a device name with the typo; what would be the best place to report such an issue?
T 1613114547 18<22mkowalski_18>	Does it belong under xlibinput or is it something more for the OS itself?
T 1613114599 18<24chrisawi18>	are you sure it's not coming from the device itself? what is the typo exactly?
T 1613114646 18<22mkowalski_18>	Ok, so yesterday I've been updating kernel and some other packages. Before I had `'Logitech MX Ergo Mouse'` which now became `'Logitech MX Ergo Multi-Device Trackball '` <-- note the space at the end
T 1613114666 18<22mkowalski_18>	Given that it's the same device, it's not something that would be coming from it I guess (otherwise why would the name change)
T 1613115388 18<24chrisawi18>	maybe the logitech unifying receiver got a firmware update via fwupd?
T 1613115438 18<22mkowalski_18>	It's a bluetooth device and no fw update happened in between
T 1613115448 18<22mkowalski_18>	https://pastebin.com/raw/phbLsLun <-- some info if anything would help here, but I doubt
T 1613115469 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the bluetoothctl perspective its name is only "MX Ergo", so I wonder where exactly the full name comes from
T 1613115588 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the update log I see that it's been kernel upgrading to 5.10.13 and libevdev to 1.11.0, so I wonder if that could be coming from the latter
T 1613115788 18<22mkowalski_18>	In the kernel itself I have only managed to find this commit -- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7de843dbaaa68aa514090e6226ed7c6374fd7e49 -- but it does not seem to be included in 5.10.13, thus probably irrelevant
T 1613125780 18<24mrvenkman18>	Hi. Using Gnome boxes - I have found that deleting the box via the right click menu, there is no warning, but there is a "undo delete" that pops up straight away.
T 1613125854 18<24mrvenkman18>	Clicking on "undo delete" doesn't undo deleting the box. It is deleted. LUCKILY I knew this behaviour and backed up the image. However, restoring the images into ./local/gnome-boxes/images - the option to use that box still isn't available. I presume I need to also restore some meta data.
T 1613125874 18<24mrvenkman18>	Anyone know where this meta data is normally stored and what it needs to contain?

T 1613126191 18<24mrvenkman18>	Fedora 33 - clicking undo definitely doesn't undo it. If you click undo, then close gnome boxes and reopen gnome boxes, the image is gone.

T 1613143180 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	so the same pool will be using the same subvolumes
T 1613143195 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	so no it will be one version of fedora

T 1613143216 18<22ComputerKid18>	I'm sorry, I don't understand
T 1613143236 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	the pool is a subvolume of / and a subvolume of /home
T 1613143259 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	you would need separate subvolumes for each fedora version
T 1613143276 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	you would need separate / subvolumes for each fedora version
T 1613143291 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	home could be shared
T 1613143314 18<22ComputerKid18>	Okay, that's what I meant. I thought that the pool was the top layer, and the subvols were under it

T 1613143392 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	also you will have to edit grub to boot each release per subvolume
T 1613143412 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	so you will have more than one pool for this to happen IMHO

T 1613154628 18<20cmurf18>	grub.cfg is intended to be static going forward, you won't need to recreate it unless something significant has changed, like file system or drive change

T 1613154732 18<25elagost18>	So on new kernel installs we don't need to regenerate grub? How does that work?
T 1613154785 18<25elagost18>	in my understanding grub scans /boot for kernels and shows a menu based on that; is it dynamic these days?
T 1613154787 18<20cmurf18>	regenerating grub.cfg was never done on fedora since i can remember, grub2-mkconfig was one time at installation and from then on it was always modified by grubby using precise insertion and removal
T 1613154851 18<20cmurf18>	that grubby became grubby-deprecated in fedora 30, the grubby we have now is a shell script for some tasks folks may be familiar with like setting default kernel to boot instead of using e.g. grub2-set-default or grub2-editenv directly
T 1613154879 18<20cmurf18>	the grub.cfg still contains os-prober entries like Windows and non-Fedora OS's
T 1613154921 18<20cmurf18>	but there's a command in there, blscfg, that executes a GRUB module of the same name, which then parses the snippets in /boot/loader/entries and inserts them into the boot menu
T 1613154990 18<20cmurf18>	you can still change command line options in /etc/default/grub, and run grub2-mkconfig (with or without -o, doesn't matter) and part of that script will modify just the options line in each bls snippet
T 1613154997 18<20cmurf18>	it doesn't recreate the snippets from scratch
T 1613155009 18<25elagost18>	interesting. Haven't had to manually touch grub in a long time, just curious. Thanks for the info!
T 1613155033 18<25elagost18>	grub2-mkconfig without -o will appropriately find and update grub.cfg on both BIOS and UEFI systems then?
T 1613155064 18<20cmurf18>	no, if you do it without -o, it only modifies the command line options in bls snippets - whether BIOS or UEFI
T 1613155090 18<20cmurf18>	i know it's a bit confusing but you can just do it the way you have been
T 1613155098 18<20cmurf18>	there's nothing wrong with overwriting the grub.cfg
T 1613155119 18<20cmurf18>	but what's really happening when you change command line options is, the bls snippets get modified
T 1613155177 18<20cmurf18>	the bls snippets contain all knowledge about each boot entry, the grub.cfg is intended to be GRUB specific stuff
T 1613155188 18<20cmurf18>	where the BLS snippets are intended to be standardized across all bootloaders
T 1613155462 18<20cmurf18>	ComputerKid: if you're willing to hand edit the GRUB menu entry you can change rootflags=subvol=root34 to whatever subvol you want to boot (as root)
T 1613155493 18<20cmurf18>	so you can do it that way or create separate bls snippets for each subvolume you want to boot, give them their own title and whatever
T 1613155533 18<20cmurf18>	i have to tell you, it does get confusing to have two computers each with just f33 and f34 roots
T 1613155603 18<20cmurf18>	maybe it's just by short term memory :P but the other day i was like "wth! this bodhi update isn't available!" and as it turns out i was booted the wrong release versions and ... yeah

T 1614106370 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	I think a few reboots happened. I certainly didn't run fpaste while my computer was crashed.
T 1614106405 18<20cmurf18>	ok and is this a one off crash or is it happening often
T 1614106430 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	It seems to happen every time I play a game with OpenGL graphics. Mindustry, Minetest, Colobot, GZDoom.

T 1614106502 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	At least Mindustry seems to autosave.
T 1614106514 18<20cmurf18>	can you check previous boots?
T 1614106529 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	How?
T 1614106530 18<20cmurf18>	journalctl -b is the current boot log
T 1614106555 18<20cmurf18>	journalctl -b-1 is the previous one, and you can add -k to see just kernel messages
T 1614106559 18<20cmurf18>	journal -b-2 is the one before that and so on
T 1614106561 18<20cmurf18>	journalctl rather
T 1614106648 18<20cmurf18>	in your past i see sysrq w and f

T 1614106672 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	Yeah, I was just testing out sysrq commands.
T 1614106692 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	Maybe next time it crashes I can do sysrq reisub instead of holding the power button
T 1614106694 18<20cmurf18>	got it
T 1614106756 18<20cmurf18>	anyway it'd be useful to know where the journals stop
T 1614106775 18<20cmurf18>	i.e. journalctl -b-1 -k --no-pager, and then try -b-2, then -b-3
T 1614106791 18<20cmurf18>	because if they stop before logging the problem, then the journal isn't much help figuring it out
T 1614106842 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	Looks like -b-3 happened before a crash
T 1614106871 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	It kinda does stop before logging a problem, but there are a few libinput errors at the end
T 1614106886 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	But I got the same thing through ssh

T 1614106957 18<20cmurf18>	or at least making it super unresponsive
T 1614106964 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	Here it is with -k https://paste.centos.org/view/cddd5180

T 1614107365 18<20cmurf18>	i don't see anything weird in that fpaste
T 1614107420 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	do you think it might be an oom?
T 1614107439 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	i mean, do you think it might be out of memory or something? Maybe I should try sysrq f next time it crashes
T 1614107455 18<20cmurf18>	bug also that seems like the wrong boot because the start is Feb 23 10:57:45 and the end is Feb 23 11:00:17
T 1614107467 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	still want to see the sudo fpaste --sysinfo so we can see what hardware we are dealing with
T 1614107470 18<20cmurf18>	so it's just 3 minutes of kernel message, it's basically just a startup
T 1614107480 18<20cmurf18>	oh that's up ^

T 1614107500 18<20cmurf18>	that's it
T 1614107521 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	I know it's the right boot because without -k I can see I was playing mindustry
T 1614107558 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	also, there's no error messages, business as usual, but there's also no messages about going through the normal process of shutting down or rebooting
T 1614107581 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	I think that's a big sign something went wrong if you were looking at it without context
T 1614107674 18<20cmurf18>	the kernel doesn't report shutdown or reboot, but systemd will
T 1614107713 18<20cmurf18>	kernel's oom killer is logged witih kernel messages; Workstation Edition has earlyoom
T 1614107719 18<20cmurf18>	you can filter for that

T 1614304669 18<27solicito18>	the problem now is, how do I get it back or fix it
T 1614304772 18<20plarsen18>	Your error indicates that for SOME reason Windows cares how the hypervisor stores the virtual disk.
T 1614304802 18<20plarsen18>	I'm not a Windows guy - haven't run it for more than a decade, so I'm not sure if there are tricks to make Windows run as a VM - it should not care. That said, using a Directory is quite common
T 1614304828 18<20plarsen18>	So be sure the directory exists and is accessible to qemu. When you create the VM, use "custom" disk, and pick the right disk domain.
T 1614304844 18<20plarsen18>	You then "manually" create the disk, and virtual manager will assign it to the VM
T 1614304854 18<20plarsen18>	(manually create it by hitting the big +)
T 1614304912 18<20plarsen18>	If your Windows somehow thinks it need full access to a raw device, my guess is that Windows wants to own your hardware perhaps because it's not meant to be used on virtual machines. In that case my advice is simple "don't".
T 1614304969 18<27Sokel18>	It shouldn't be trying to use it as a raw device. I've never had that happen choosing windows for a VM.
T 1614304982 18<28linuxmodder18>	solicito,  coming in late what is the error ?
T 1614304995 18<20plarsen18>	The default storage type is "Filesystem Directory". Never had an issue with it - EVER. I "dir disk" doesn't exist, but you can definitely provide raw disk access to a VM
T 1614304995 18<28linuxmodder18>	and confirming windows is the guest vm on fedora host yes?
T 1614305007 18<27solicito18>	yes
T 1614305022 18<27Sokel18>	So you're making a new VM, you attach a disk, and the windows installer doesn't see the disk?
T 1614305035 18<27solicito18>	when installing the vm, windows is not able to find a disk to install the os
T 1614305049 18<27Sokel18>	Then you need the virtio scsi driver.
T 1614305064 18<27solicito18>	i was able to installed it last week
