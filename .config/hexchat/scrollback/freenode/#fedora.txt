T 1575837786 18<27tairikuookami18>	you're using gnome.  the gnome bug reporting tool is garbage.  it's failing.  sure, if it actually *worked* you could expect it to file a bug on your behalf..  it's broken.  so it's up to you to file the bug report on the things that actually matter, which is more audacity and calendar and much less the bug-reporting-tool.
T 1575838849 18<26Khaytsus18>	the problem is not the 'gnome' bug reporting tool.  First off, it's not gnome. Second, yes, sometimes it wants to install a ton of debug stuff to get more data and it fails.  And yes, if you can reproduce the issue just log it manually.  Rather than it being automatic, with no context.

T 1577997253 18<29knaccc18>	yeah finding the release notes is one thing. interpreting the significance of them is an entirely different ball game
T 1577997266 18<29knaccc18>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions

T 1577997366 18<20sfranken18>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
T 1577997392 18<20sfranken18>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
T 1577997468 18<29knaccc18>	ok thanks
T 1577997626 18<20sfranken18>	Same goes for CentOS though
T 1577997674 18<29knaccc18>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
T 1577997697 18<29knaccc18>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
T 1577997739 18<20sfranken18>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
T 1577997745 18<20sfranken18>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
T 1577997779 18<20sfranken18>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
T 1577997797 18<20sfranken18>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
T 1577997818 18<29knaccc18>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using
T 1577997837 18<20sfranken18>	And some driver backports

T 1578000364 18<24prussian18>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.

T 1579705977 18<25chasinglogic[m]18>	Hello all, I've just moved to Fedora from Ubuntu migrating my home directory from the former to my Fedora installation. It looks like Nautilus is in some ways still using the Yaru dark theme but I can't seem to find the file / setting to change it. As it is only the file preview pane is black (with black text) and the selection in the sidebar is black instead of Adwaita blue. Gnome software has similiarly weird dark
