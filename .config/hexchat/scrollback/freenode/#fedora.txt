T 1586546527 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	if you run a vm with privileged in the host, it won't be secure for your host
T 1586546530 18<28specing18>	I don't trust containers with security, too much code is involved for that
T 1586546530 18<24jesse101018>	how much of one if so
T 1586546567 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	the same for flatpak/snap... if the dev doesn't configure the container in an isolate mode, it won't be secure for the host
T 1586546599 18<28specing18>	I'm telling you that it won't be secure even if you configure it in "isolate mode", whatever that is
T 1586546713 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	isolate mode means that the services inside of the container can't communicate with the host, except through proxies
T 1586546852 18<28specing18>	mfilipe[m]: and what would those proxies be?
T 1586546873 18<28specing18>	It's shared kernel. They can't do anything without talking to the host
T 1586546924 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	snap/flatpak, for example, you can communicate with wayland if your application uses the wayland proxy
T 1586546950 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	but they can't communicate directly, except if they aren't running in an isolate mode
T 1586546994 18<28specing18>	Great, so these proxies increase attack surface even more than using plain lxc with vnc?

T 1586547068 18<28specing18>	As you said, storage is cheap these days and thus ther is nothing to be lost by going the VM route
T 1586547178 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	probably not but it's much easier to run a distro using docker than a vm

T 1586718553 18<20plarsen18>	greatgatsby, having C# on RHEL is a benefit to Red Hat - it breaks one of the last platform barriers. It's also why Microsoft is hard at work breaking the same barriers to Windows. Both sides want _all_ workloads to be compatible with their platform.
T 1586718593 18<20plarsen18>	There's a ton of dotNet out there in "enterprise land" and there's a ton of "lamp" and other stacks available that doesn't run on Windows (yet) - so yes, you'll find a lot of happy faces on both sides here seeing potentials
T 1586718625 18<22greatgatsby18>	plarsen, understood.  Please don't take my comments as anti C#.  I'm really just geniunely curious if there's a move away from Java and towards C#, where that type of language is appropriate.

T 1586718669 18<20plarsen18>	Just know it's really driven by a huge change at Microsoft.  But don't be surprised that companies like Red Hat is all on board with the changes at Microsoft ....

T 1586719207 18<19dowdle18>	greatgatsby: I doubt Red Hat is moving away from Java since a significant amount of their funds (I've heard, I have no real data) comes from the Java stuff they bought... I forget the name of it... and they maintain various Java versions after Oracle abandons them.

T 1587166238 18<29BobLfoot18>	mrvenkman: As I understand it you can allegedly add the new partition to the lvm and then to home, but I've never had success doing that.  Crashed many a system trying.  YOu could also format the partition and mount it to your existing system and have a /home2 or /stuff section for files.  That's probably clear as mud but best I can desscribe it.
T 1587166242 18<26Khaytsus18>	then you just pvcreate on the new partion then vgextend existinglvm /new/partition

T 1587166326 18<26Khaytsus18>	Honestly the _easiest_ thing.....  is just format that new partition as ext4 and use it as storage

T 1587166363 18<26Khaytsus18>	Messing about with the lvm is a neat exercise but...  well..  a lv spread over two drives is twice as much failure opportunity
T 1587166396 18<26Khaytsus18>	If you can find 10g of chunk of stuff you can move to it, or whatever, that'll work out just as well

T 1587166450 18<24mrvenkman18>	Khaytsus, interesting.
T 1587166480 18<26Khaytsus18>	You can do that booted from the system itself.. make sure it's working, pretty trivial..  add it to fstab

T 1587166514 18<26Khaytsus18>	you can then chown the mount point as your user and write to the whole drive, or mkdir something and chown it..

T 1587299266 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Maybe try using pkcon which is a CLI for PackageKit, which is the component behind GNOME Software (if you observe noticably better perf you could exclude PK and focus on the GNOME Software, otherwise it could be a problem in either of these)
T 1587299343 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Note that apparently (per Wikipedia) PK might use hawkey/librepo directly (i.e. not via DNF), meaning it's very possible there are differences between both as you observe.
T 1587299444 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: One example you could check: Support for Zchunk added in F30 <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Zchunk_Metadata>.

T 1587299873 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Assuming it's a subprocess, and nondeterministic, and the app retries repeatedly, then with a little imagination it could also explain your issue (I know, lots of assumptions, but just sayin' ;P)

T 1587299971 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Well again try pkcon, that would give you a chance to split to search in two and exclude one half.
T 1587300322 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Also use pkmon (while using GNOME Software and pkcon) to monitor PackageKit events/transactions.

T 1587300937 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Given launching it from the CLI is supposed to work, it'be extra cool if you could file that memory violation if you still have the log! Otherwise yes, would have to wait until it reappears.

T 1603108505 18<19amharris18>	Hi, folks!  I've used (GNU/)Linux for quite a long time overall but have been away from using it on my own machines for a fair number of years, (aside from when I have scriptable, headless instances).  Got Fedora (33 beta) spun up on a new mini PC [ASUS PN50 - AMD Renior (4800U)] and it's all running smoothly, but I'm having an odd problem I'm trying to figure out.
T 1603108666 18<19fedora_sec18>	What's the odd problem?
T 1603108691 18<19amharris18>	In short, whether at high loads or idling, the system will eventually and intermittently crash to a black screen.  I'm not sure if it's GNOME, but it seems to be a fairly messy state.  If I press the power button (to go into suspend), it'll then spit out errors in a text interface, but I basically have to hard reset [at least so far].
T 1603108707 18<19fedora_sec18>	Are you using KDE?
T 1603108716 18<19amharris18>	Nope.  GNOME; bog-standard Workstation.
T 1603108725 18<19amharris18>	on Wayland (and Btrfs).
T 1603108749 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: can you switch to tty and check if there is any kernel message / trace ?
T 1603108752 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's a problem with Renior, given it's still fairly recent, or if it's 33; or a combination.
T 1603108780 18<19fedora_sec18>	Ah wayland. Does the computer automatically lock itself? Because I was using Parrot OS and when it tried to lock itself, it would freeze because it didn't have the right thing to lock itself, so I switched off the auto locking and switched the rendering too
T 1603108869 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Yeah, I tried to jump into the logs and system logs sometimes throw a warning of access.  I don't think I've ever 'main'-ed GNOME 3 (and it's been so long since I've played around with a new setup; last Linux workstation was on Debian Wheezy with OpenBox ...yup!).
T 1603108890 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: it also looks like you system doesn't die, it's just the screen going black so you can check the syslog for those
T 1603108896 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: I'm at work right now, but I'll get as much info as I can when I get home.
T 1603108916 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: also: use the sysrq to restart the system if it happens, don't use the power button (but you need to enable the sysrq to do so, they are disabled by default)
T 1603108918 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: hehe, hence my little explanation above. ;-)
T 1603108975 18<26Khaytsus18>	If not suggested yet, try the Xorg (Classic) login vs Wayland.
T 1603108980 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: to enable: echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' > /etc/sysctl.d/sysrq.conf
T 1603109004 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's relevant at all but having never really had more of a business-orientated system before, I didn't really think about 1.2V for the DRAM and got 1.35V 3200MHz memory instead (but not at JEDEC spec and only XMP); listed as compatible but it clocks it down to 2666MHz at 1.2V.  Not sure if that's relevant at all.
T 1603109065 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: that would be a point for the hardware vendor, not for Fedora people I suppose, we can only speculate on that topic :)
T 1603109110 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Albeit a touch embarrassing, I've never actually used SysRq.  Though I get the basics of what it does, what's the reason you're suggesting/requesting I use it to restart the system?
T 1603109135 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: True, true.  Just throwing it out there in case there's an "aha!  I've seen/heard about this before." :-)
T 1603109173 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: with the sysrq equence s u b, you will sync the cache to disk (s), remount everything read only (u), and then reset (b). This is a way of shutting down with less risk of corrupting the file system
T 1603109450 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Ah, fab—just what I like. :-)  I hope that worst case it'd just be a few bits being flipped and not a risk of a borked install [with hard resets]. >.<
T 1603109516 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: without sysrq the chances of having a borked install are much lower I'd say
T 1603109567 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Do you mean 'with'?

T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	Hello, I'd like to report a kind of bug (I guess) on fedora-workstation 33 in conjunction with keepassxc: the issue is already being discussed there: https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/5608 . In short, the search field in keepassxc doesn't take any typing input unless keppasxc is started through the terminal with "keepassxc -plateform wayland". The problem is ongoing since about October 2020. For me the
T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	problem disappeared after the updates including the new kernel 5.10.11 until today's update including keepassxc V2.6.4. According to the discussions in the link above, it seems to be a Wayland and or Qt issue. Are you already aware of the bug? Can you do something about it? Should I report elsewhere? Thanks in advance for your help! 😀

T 1612729511 18<25jakelazaroff18>	@cmurf nope, only three logs from systemd-journald are "journal started", "runtime journal" with a path and some numbers, and then "journal stopped"
T 1612729563 18<20cmurf18>	ahh well it's normal for there to be one "stopped" because at first it's running from the initramfs
T 1612729574 18<20cmurf18>	and it stops and restarts from disk

T 1612729835 18<25jakelazaroff18>	that's neat, thanks
T 1612729837 18<20cmurf18>	personal preference i guess, makes it easier to find unexpected gaps in the log
T 1612729850 18<20cmurf18>	more like dmesg

T 1612729934 18<25jakelazaroff18>	there's a folder in /var/log/journal as well
T 1612729935 18<20cmurf18>	ok
T 1612729941 18<20cmurf18>	that's normal
T 1612729947 18<20cmurf18>	tht's the persistent journal location
T 1612729969 18<20cmurf18>	on fedora, /etc/systemd/journald.conf defaults to storage=auto which means if the /var/log/journal exists, use that
T 1612729982 18<20cmurf18>	if it doesn't, then it's in /run/log/journal which is volatile
T 1612730009 18<20cmurf18>	what do you get for 'systemctl status systemd-journald'
T 1612730037 18<25jakelazaroff18>	green, active
T 1612730180 18<20cmurf18>	and it's logging things still? except for one service?
T 1612730190 18<25jakelazaroff18>	no, sorry, i think that was a red herring
T 1612730206 18<25jakelazaroff18>	the logs stop after that first "journal stopped"
T 1612730224 18<25jakelazaroff18>	i misread the logs beforehand and thought they were still coming in
T 1612730237 18<20cmurf18>	what's the time stamp for /var/log/journal/$MACHINEID/system.journal
T 1612730245 18<20cmurf18>	is it stale?
T 1612730306 18<20cmurf18>	something like 'sudo systemctl restart packagekit' is enough to force both the sudo command and the service restart to be inserted into the journal
T 1612730334 18<20cmurf18>	and it should show up just by 'journalctl --since=-1m'
T 1612730341 18<20cmurf18>	that's -1m
T 1612730372 18<20cmurf18>	sorta funny to me, as if +1m could exist and act like a time machine
T 1612730386 18<25jakelazaroff18>	lol you could set your clock back i suppose
T 1612730398 18<25jakelazaroff18>	um sorry tho, what do you mean by timestamp for that file

T 1612730419 18<20cmurf18>	like is it being written to at all?
T 1612730473 18<25jakelazaroff18>	not stale, 20:41
T 1612730479 18<25jakelazaroff18>	both system.journal and user-1000.journal
T 1612730487 18<20cmurf18>	i haven't seen it recently but i've seen journald get confused due to corrupt journals (which you don't have) and it fails to show contents that are in the journal
T 1612730494 18<20cmurf18>	most of that stuff has been ironed out
T 1612730499 18<20cmurf18>	ok so it's writing to it
T 1612730506 18<20cmurf18>	but you have no recent entries

T 1612730520 18<20cmurf18>	that is weird
T 1612730525 18<25jakelazaroff18>	yeah that's the confusing thing to me — the process is green, verify works fine
T 1612730527 18<20cmurf18>	i guess i would just start poking it with a stick
T 1612730538 18<20cmurf18>	like i'd probably just restart it
T 1612730544 18<20cmurf18>	systemctl restart systemd-journald
T 1612730548 18<20cmurf18>	see if that fixes it
T 1612730565 18<25jakelazaroff18>	so that works
T 1612730567 18<20cmurf18>	if not i'd 'journalctl --rotate' to force journal rotation
T 1612730615 18<20cmurf18>	it got stuck somehow
T 1612730638 18<25jakelazaroff18>	my problem here is that this is on servers that are getting started up automatically, so i can't manually restart systemd-journald every time
T 1612730645 18<20cmurf18>	so i dunno, haven't seen that one, you could have done 'sudo strace -p PID' for systemd-journald and see what it's doing and file a bug :P
T 1612730685 18<25jakelazaroff18>	going for the hacky fix here — is there a way to have it automatically restart systemd-journald on startup?
T 1612730700 18<20cmurf18>	this shouldn't happen regularly or it's a bug
T 1612730720 18<20cmurf18>	it does restart on startup already so making it do it again isn't gonna fix things
T 1612730735 18<20cmurf18>	it starts from initramfs, logs, restarts from disk, logs indefinitely
T 1612730758 18<20cmurf18>	so if it's getting stuck on every reboot that's not good
T 1612730762 18<20cmurf18>	this is f33? or rawhide?
T 1612730776 18<25jakelazaroff18>	f32
T 1612730779 18<20cmurf18>	hmm
T 1612730801 18<20cmurf18>	and this happens on every reboot?
T 1612730804 18<20cmurf18>	it just gets stuck?
T 1612730933 18<25jakelazaroff18>	to give a little more context, these are servers on digitalocean from an image i'm building with packer. so basically what happens is a server boots up, gets provisioned, the disk gets saved as an image, and then that becomes the template for new servers
T 1612730942 18<25jakelazaroff18>	so whenever i spin up a server from that image, this happens
T 1612730993 18<20cmurf18>	uhh hmm
T 1612731053 18<25jakelazaroff18>	although… this is super weird — if i reboot the server, it works fine
T 1612731148 18<22LeoNice8118>	Can I ask some general irc questions please?
T 1612731331 18<22LeoNice8118>	I'm using #Revolution IRC for Android anyone familiar with it?

T 1612731469 18<20cmurf18>	jakelazaroff: it sounds like a new server provisioned from the cloned image is confusing the running server?

T 1612809576 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah on macs, the thing we use on Fedora for /boot/efi is not the real EFI System partition

T 1612809598 18<26slop18>	macs. /me washes hands.

T 1612809728 18<25Amgine[m]18>	kk. Well, thanks for the quick solution, and I will keep you apprised if there are future similar behaviors.
T 1612809731 18<26slop18>	Its a step in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded/outside of technical people updates. and making updates LESS scary so theya re applied.
T 1612809736 18<20cmurf18>	you just reboot and once every week or two (sometimes more often due to firefox or a kernel security fix) you get updates on the reboot

T 1612809779 18<20cmurf18>	Amgine[m]: yeah because the kernel package is responsible for writing that that conf file, and then also updating the grub environment file

T 1612809886 18<22akik18>	cmurf: on an 2011 imac, the efi system partition is a normal vfat partition. there's an installer bug that makes it so that you can't install the boot loader in the installer
T 1612809925 18<20cmurf18>	akik: there is a real FAT32 ESP but Apple only uses it for firmware update staging
T 1612809932 18<20cmurf18>	they don't use it for booting and neither does Fedora

T 1612809998 18<20cmurf18>	because the installer, if it knows it's on a mac, will create /boot/efi on HFS+, it will not reuse the FAT32 ESP
T 1612810024 18<20cmurf18>	there is a bug in the f33 installer where it creates both FAT32 and HFS+ partitions, but only uses the HFS+ one for /boot/efi
T 1612810071 18<20cmurf18>	the unused FAT32 volume is left untouched - forever ghosted
T 1612810101 18<22akik18>	cmurf: that's where the installer goes wrong. it should just use the existing esp

T 1612811024 18<20cmurf18>	that's interesting because Apple had used a 200M FAT32 ESP for a very long time, since the start of EFI with x86 macs
T 1612811056 18<20cmurf18>	Soo it must be that whatever does the test for "is it a mac" isn't working with newer macs? HUH

T 1612811156 18<20cmurf18>	like i said earlier, it's part of mactel-boot stuff to make it easier for mac users
T 1612811166 18<22akik18>	i can paste the contents if you want
T 1612811185 18<20cmurf18>	originally Fedora also appeared in the Startup panel, but i think Apple broke that part and now only the built-in firmware Boot Manager shows Fedora
T 1612811227 18<20cmurf18>	did you use Custom partitioning? or Advanced-Custom?
T 1612811243 18<22akik18>	if i try to install fedora or centos on it, i'm just getting some weird error like efi system partition can't be of type esp

T 1612811264 18<22akik18>	then i need to unselect the install boot loader in the installer and after install, install it
T 1612811292 18<20cmurf18>	oh ok so you're just being stubborn and want to do things your way rather than the installer's way :D

T 1612811466 18<22akik18>	i found the solution on redhat's bugzilla
T 1612811497 18<20cmurf18>	you must be doing Custom or Advanced-Custom installation, because that error message only happens in those paths

T 1612811533 18<20cmurf18>	ok and if you create /boot/efi on a mac as Linux HFS+ EFI, you do not get the error you're talking about
T 1612811560 18<19foxide18>	You don't even need to do that. FAT32 EFI works just fine, Apple EFI looks for the fallback bootloader same as UEFI implementations.
T 1612811562 18<20cmurf18>	you only get the error if you try to force it to do something it has a rule against doing
T 1612811572 18<22akik18>	so fedora has decided not to use the common esp on macs as with any other platform?
T 1612811577 18<20cmurf18>	correct

T 1612811629 18<20cmurf18>	Because Apple's firmware ignores it except as a final fallback volume

T 1612811649 18<20cmurf18>	you only get that if the files are on an HFS+ volume

T 1613072158 18<20cmurf18>	if you use Custom, there is a partition scheme popup with a Btrfs preset, if you choose that and click the blue text above it to create partitions automatically you'll get the same layout as the "Automatic" install path used on desktop installers
T 1613072217 18<20cmurf18>	Although, hmm :) I'm not certain you get a /home mountpoint on Server no matter the partition scheme
T 1613072218 18<29fyksen18>	Okey, but if I want striped array, is that supported in the installer also?
T 1613072245 18<20cmurf18>	yeah you can do that in Custom or Advanced-Custom
T 1613072249 18<29fyksen18>	/home is not important. Can always fix that later
T 1613072280 18<20cmurf18>	the UI for Custom is, click on /, then on the right there's a Volume(s) option, click on the Modify button under it
T 1613072288 18<20cmurf18>	and you can choose raid0 there
T 1613072316 18<26slop18>	mmmm butter.
T 1613072318 18<20cmurf18>	I'm not certain if you get raid0 metadata and data; or if you get raid0 data and raid1 metadata
T 1613072327 18<20cmurf18>	but you can also fix that after the installation
T 1613072345 18<20cmurf18>	i'll try it - you do want raid1 metadata, even for raid0 data
T 1613072387 18<29fyksen18>	Ahh, okey. Thanks. I will read a bit up about metadata on btrfs.
T 1613072391 18<20cmurf18>	while the system won't survive a full device failure, the file system itself can survive and self-heal still, if there are things like bad sectors, dropped/redirected writes
T 1613072401 18<29fyksen18>	But it makes sense
T 1613072457 18<20cmurf18>	yeah if there's any kind of isolated/limited trouble with one of the devices, at least the fs survives - but of course data is a far larger payload so chances are that's what gets hit by such corruptions
T 1613072467 18<20cmurf18>	and in the raid0 case it pretty much means trouble
T 1613072497 18<20cmurf18>	it really just depends on what the corruption hits, but btrfs will tell you that :D

T 1613074530 18<20cmurf18>	rustysysdev_: very minor point, i probably wouldn't use xfs for /boot because in very rare cases it's possible for it to be inconsistent from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613074559 18<20cmurf18>	bootloader can't do journal replay is what it comes down to
T 1613074603 18<20cmurf18>	xfs in particular only guarantees the journal contains metadata updates on fsync, not that the journal is flushed
T 1613074705 18<28rustysysdev_18>	cmurf, Interesting, and thanks! Its seems to be the default for Fedora33 when generating a new BRTFS configuration via the GUI i wonder why.. Ill look into changing it!
T 1613074724 18<20cmurf18>	humm
T 1613074746 18<20cmurf18>	i wonder if that's part of Server related kickstart stuff
T 1613074793 18<20cmurf18>	i think originally it was ext4 /boot and xfs /
T 1613074805 18<20cmurf18>	maybe it got changed to xfs for both
T 1613074827 18<20cmurf18>	and now with btrfs preset it defers to the Server kickstart for /boot
T 1613074854 18<28rustysysdev_18>	not sure, but if the bootloader cannot indeed do replay then it indeed should be changed.. I wonder if the bootloader can somehow do replay now?
T 1613074864 18<20cmurf18>	nope
T 1613074868 18<20cmurf18>	not for ext4 either
T 1613074964 18<20cmurf18>	it's just to complicated to have two different places to maintain journal replay code, so far no one is interested in doing it
T 1613074997 18<20cmurf18>	in no particular order, use FAT, ext2, ext4 with journaling disabled, or btrfs
T 1613075003 18<26slop18>	This community here is so nice. Ive been in other channels that people are very..... impatient? snipe-ish?
T 1613075026 18<28rustysysdev_18>	I have been using netinstaller for everything since fedora 21.. possibly before then.. but cannot remember. I remember it used to provision ext2, and then ext4, and now even on my 32 install its xfs
T 1613075035 18<20cmurf18>	i can't remember either
T 1613075065 18<20cmurf18>	yeah almost no chance you run into this, because also dracut does an FIFREEZE/FITHAW on /boot on xfs
T 1613075085 18<20cmurf18>	that flushes the journal to the fs, so that the bootloader has a consistent view
T 1613075111 18<20cmurf18>	so this teeny tiny issue probably won't ever happen in the usual case
T 1613075120 18<20cmurf18>	s/usual case/normal usage/
T 1613075195 18<20cmurf18>	also systemd does a umount of /boot which also flushes journal to fs metadata
T 1613075272 18<28rustysysdev_18>	so not a huge issue, in that the file system should never see an unclean state.. but probably better to switch.. I think ill move it to ext4 with journaling disabled.
T 1613075273 18<20cmurf18>	so the only time you might get in trouble is: (a) modify anything related to the current default boot files, such as /boot/loader/entries files (b) reboot -f or sysrq+b or crash
T 1613075289 18<20cmurf18>	not a huge issue
T 1613075292 18<20cmurf18>	teeny tiny

T 1613075380 18<28rustysysdev_18>	:D well, i will take any review over none!
T 1613076084 18<26slop18>	cmurf, how did you learn the items above?
T 1613076294 18<20cmurf18>	slop: suffering
T 1613076296 18<20cmurf18>	haha
T 1613076318 18<20cmurf18>	i dunno the whole story but someone filed a bug, they had /boot as a directory on an XFS /
T 1613076341 18<20cmurf18>	and something was consistently preventing the usual behavior of / being remounted ro
T 1613076364 18<20cmurf18>	/ can't be unmounted on a reboot, but it should be remounted ro, which also flushes the journal
T 1613076410 18<20cmurf18>	even though it wasn't remounted ro, the system was rebooted anyway rather than hang (which we could have a lot of legit debate about what to do about this)
T 1613076437 18<20cmurf18>	but the consequence was, the bootloader didn't see the changes in /boot - it saw a 0 byte grub.cfg following kernel upgrades
T 1613076443 18<26slop18>	haha :) very impressed no joke
T 1613076448 18<20cmurf18>	so it face planted
T 1613076487 18<20cmurf18>	and if all you did was boot from a usb rescue, and mount the file system, journal replay happened, the grub.cfg was fine
T 1613076508 18<20cmurf18>	but if you mounted root ro,nologreplay - it was 0 bytes
T 1613076534 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah, fixing it was just mount normally and then reboot, grub works now
T 1613076557 18<20cmurf18>	but the key thing is you want to prevent these things in the first place :)
T 1613076563 18<26slop18>	nice, I wouldve missed that completely. nice work
T 1613076573 18<20cmurf18>	oh it drove me nuts
T 1613076600 18<20cmurf18>	and it turns into a bit of head butting upstream, like the bootloader doing the wrong thing, the file system doing the wrong thing, on and on
T 1613076608 18<20cmurf18>	you know, finger pointing
T 1613076637 18<20cmurf18>	as it turns out, everyone is right but that doesn't solve the problem
T 1613076720 18<24d9k18>	if that would happen with bls you would just not get the entry for the next kernel i think
T 1613076738 18<24d9k18>	since all the bits are generated from the conf at /loader and grub.cfg is untouched
T 1613076739 18<20cmurf18>	i think so
T 1613076742 18<24d9k18>	should be untouched..
T 1613076745 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076747 18<20cmurf18>	good point
T 1613076766 18<20cmurf18>	this might be totally obsoleted by bls
T 1613076769 18<26slop18>	cmurf, I get that completely -  thank you
T 1613076819 18<20cmurf18>	the last write should be to write a new bls file, and it should either be present or not
T 1613076850 18<20cmurf18>	from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613076857 18<24d9k18>	if a new grub.cfg is moved in its place to replace it and only the metadata update happened then you would be in the same situation
T 1613076884 18<24d9k18>	even if it is the same data just written over
T 1613076896 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076907 18<20cmurf18>	in that case it's involving rename
T 1613076932 18<24d9k18>	chattr +i grub.cfg problem solved hehe
T 1613076951 18<20cmurf18>	so you can end up with 0 length files because the journal contains the rename, not yet flushed to the fs itself which is all the bootloader sees
T 1613076969 18<24d9k18>	yeah
T 1613076987 18<20cmurf18>	in practice, nothing changes grub.cfg anymore but a sysadmin
T 1613077106 18<20cmurf18>	maybe one day i'll try to sabotage this again and see if i can break anything
T 1613077136 18<20cmurf18>	dm-log-writes would be a better way to do it
T 1613077179 18<20cmurf18>	it breaks down all changes so we can see whether a crash at each step results in an undesirable/unmanagable view of the filesystem
T 1613077292 18<20cmurf18>	dm-log-writes is really cool, one of the btrfs maintainers wrote that for power fail testing, now the xfstests that are used by all linux file systems includes tests using dm-log-writes

T 1613085264 18<24d9k18>	this is just a minimal reprocuder i made to run in a unattended vm but you can run the for loop ofc on your running kernel

T 1613085398 18<20cmurf18>	this is one reason why i use subvolumes/rw snapshots to isolate things

T 1613085470 18<20cmurf18>	but if the corruption can be trimmed out by just deleting a subvolume, it just dereferences nodes that contain the problem rather than cow
T 1613085483 18<20cmurf18>	if it read it, to cow, it'd hit the corruption and faceplant
T 1613085488 18<20cmurf18>	just like in qemu
T 1613085507 18<20cmurf18>	but oh ignore what i just wrote - the root file system would go read only because of this
T 1613085540 18<20cmurf18>	the question is whether the write time tree check stopped it before it was written out, and i think the answer to that is yes

T 1613085774 18<24d9k18>	since this is a quick reprocuder i imagine it wouldnt be too hard to debug, since reproducing is always the hard bit

T 1613085795 18<20cmurf18>	well the backing file is memory so this can be that bug hmm
T 1613085807 18<24d9k18>	i think so
T 1613085822 18<24d9k18>	or what you mean
T 1613085829 18<20cmurf18>	so
T 1613085868 18<20cmurf18>	consider a more persistent virt-manager setup, raw backing file, and you use a cache mode that supports o_direct like none
T 1613085879 18<20cmurf18>	or directsync
T 1613085907 18<20cmurf18>	and if that raw backing file is on btrfs, and is datacow, your raw backing file is being checksummed
T 1613085945 18<20cmurf18>	o_direct allows file systems to do inflight changes of buffered data, there's no enforcement for stable writes
T 1613085982 18<20cmurf18>	so we get a write and checksum for the write in the raw file; and a subsequent inflight write changes the data does not update the csum and we start seeing csum errors
T 1613086044 18<20cmurf18>	part of why the default is nodatacow for raw/qcow2 files on btrfs with libvirt, and the default cache mode is writeback
T 1613086048 18<20cmurf18>	problem doesn't happen with either of those

T 1613114465 18<22mkowalski_18>	Good morning
T 1613114512 18<22mkowalski_18>	Question about reporting such a problem - dmesg for `input` shows a device name with the typo; what would be the best place to report such an issue?
T 1613114547 18<22mkowalski_18>	Does it belong under xlibinput or is it something more for the OS itself?
T 1613114599 18<24chrisawi18>	are you sure it's not coming from the device itself? what is the typo exactly?
T 1613114646 18<22mkowalski_18>	Ok, so yesterday I've been updating kernel and some other packages. Before I had `'Logitech MX Ergo Mouse'` which now became `'Logitech MX Ergo Multi-Device Trackball '` <-- note the space at the end
T 1613114666 18<22mkowalski_18>	Given that it's the same device, it's not something that would be coming from it I guess (otherwise why would the name change)
T 1613115388 18<24chrisawi18>	maybe the logitech unifying receiver got a firmware update via fwupd?
T 1613115438 18<22mkowalski_18>	It's a bluetooth device and no fw update happened in between
T 1613115448 18<22mkowalski_18>	https://pastebin.com/raw/phbLsLun <-- some info if anything would help here, but I doubt
T 1613115469 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the bluetoothctl perspective its name is only "MX Ergo", so I wonder where exactly the full name comes from
T 1613115588 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the update log I see that it's been kernel upgrading to 5.10.13 and libevdev to 1.11.0, so I wonder if that could be coming from the latter
T 1613115788 18<22mkowalski_18>	In the kernel itself I have only managed to find this commit -- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7de843dbaaa68aa514090e6226ed7c6374fd7e49 -- but it does not seem to be included in 5.10.13, thus probably irrelevant
T 1613125780 18<24mrvenkman18>	Hi. Using Gnome boxes - I have found that deleting the box via the right click menu, there is no warning, but there is a "undo delete" that pops up straight away.
T 1613125854 18<24mrvenkman18>	Clicking on "undo delete" doesn't undo deleting the box. It is deleted. LUCKILY I knew this behaviour and backed up the image. However, restoring the images into ./local/gnome-boxes/images - the option to use that box still isn't available. I presume I need to also restore some meta data.
T 1613125874 18<24mrvenkman18>	Anyone know where this meta data is normally stored and what it needs to contain?
T 1613126128 18<24mrvenkman18>	https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/25/html/Virtualization_Getting_Started_Guide/delete-box.html
T 1613126148 18<24mrvenkman18>	" Click the X on the confirmation notification if you are sure you have deleted the correct boxes. Or click UNDO if you made a mistake. "
T 1613126191 18<24mrvenkman18>	Fedora 33 - clicking undo definitely doesn't undo it. If you click undo, then close gnome boxes and reopen gnome boxes, the image is gone.

T 1613143153 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	the way you wrote that is multiple verson of fedora in the same pool

T 1613143180 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	so the same pool will be using the same subvolumes
T 1613143195 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	so no it will be one version of fedora

T 1613143236 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	the pool is a subvolume of / and a subvolume of /home
T 1613143259 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	you would need separate subvolumes for each fedora version
T 1613143276 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	you would need separate / subvolumes for each fedora version
T 1613143291 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	home could be shared
T 1613143314 18<22ComputerKid18>	Okay, that's what I meant. I thought that the pool was the top layer, and the subvols were under it

T 1613143392 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	also you will have to edit grub to boot each release per subvolume

T 1613154787 18<20cmurf18>	regenerating grub.cfg was never done on fedora since i can remember, grub2-mkconfig was one time at installation and from then on it was always modified by grubby using precise insertion and removal
T 1613154851 18<20cmurf18>	that grubby became grubby-deprecated in fedora 30, the grubby we have now is a shell script for some tasks folks may be familiar with like setting default kernel to boot instead of using e.g. grub2-set-default or grub2-editenv directly

T 1613155177 18<20cmurf18>	the bls snippets contain all knowledge about each boot entry, the grub.cfg is intended to be GRUB specific stuff
