I'm not fond of building kernel stubb modules every time the kernel gets updated... and Fedora is usually pretty darn closed to the latest, greatest upstream kernel release... which 3rd party modules sometimes have a problem with.

T 1586546567 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	the same for flatpak/snap... if the dev doesn't configure the container in an isolate mode, it won't be secure for the host
T 1586546599 18<28specing18>	I'm telling you that it won't be secure even if you configure it in "isolate mode", whatever that is
T 1586546713 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	isolate mode means that the services inside of the container can't communicate with the host, except through proxies
T 1586546852 18<28specing18>	mfilipe[m]: and what would those proxies be?
T 1586546873 18<28specing18>	It's shared kernel. They can't do anything without talking to the host
T 1586546924 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	snap/flatpak, for example, you can communicate with wayland if your application uses the wayland proxy
T 1586546950 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	but they can't communicate directly, except if they aren't running in an isolate mode
T 1586546994 18<28specing18>	Great, so these proxies increase attack surface even more than using plain lxc with vnc?

T 1586547068 18<28specing18>	As you said, storage is cheap these days and thus ther is nothing to be lost by going the VM route
T 1586547178 18<19mfilipe[m]18>	probably not but it's much easier to run a distro using docker than a vm

T 1586632195 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: If you installed from Fedora F31 GA KDE Plasma media or respin media... it doesn't included LibreOffice.  I just verified that by booting an .iso in a KVM VM.
T 1586632294 18<25gambl0re18>	tnelis: it works with that command. so i mustve installed using flatpak.

T 1586632419 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: LibreOffice does come preinstalled on the GNOME spin... and maybe a few other spins, but not the KDE Plasma one.
T 1586632441 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: The reason for that is that KDE has their own office suite named Caligra so that's what they have pre-installed.

T 1586633061 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: It is pixelated (and it only seems to be a few icons) that's how the flatpak shipped it.  Generally flatpaks include everything they need or rely on one or more dependency framework flatpaks.

T 1586718553 18<20plarsen18>	greatgatsby, having C# on RHEL is a benefit to Red Hat - it breaks one of the last platform barriers. It's also why Microsoft is hard at work breaking the same barriers to Windows. Both sides want _all_ workloads to be compatible with their platform.
T 1586718593 18<20plarsen18>	There's a ton of dotNet out there in "enterprise land" and there's a ton of "lamp" and other stacks available that doesn't run on Windows (yet) - so yes, you'll find a lot of happy faces on both sides here seeing potentials
T 1586718625 18<22greatgatsby18>	plarsen, understood.  Please don't take my comments as anti C#.  I'm really just geniunely curious if there's a move away from Java and towards C#, where that type of language is appropriate.

T 1586718669 18<20plarsen18>	Just know it's really driven by a huge change at Microsoft.  But don't be surprised that companies like Red Hat is all on board with the changes at Microsoft ....

T 1587300322 18<28tnelis18>	soda2[m]1: Also use pkmon (while using GNOME Software and pkcon) to monitor PackageKit events/transactions.

T 1587670197 18<28tnelis18>	libpod/podman definitely support unified cgroups (cgroupv2). Moby/Docker was lagging a bit behind but I think it'll be supported in the next release or something (if not in the latest one already). There shouldn't be much reason to switch back to cgroupv1 in the near future.

T 1602794846 18<20cmurf18>	noatime is a tradeoff: less metadata writes due to atime updates once per day (for relatime, the default); but then things like cleaning up /var/tmp/ have to fallback to mtime (I think it's mtime)
T 1602794867 18<20cmurf18>	so some things get cleaned up more aggressively because mtime isn't updated on access

T 1603108505 18<19amharris18>	Hi, folks!  I've used (GNU/)Linux for quite a long time overall but have been away from using it on my own machines for a fair number of years, (aside from when I have scriptable, headless instances).  Got Fedora (33 beta) spun up on a new mini PC [ASUS PN50 - AMD Renior (4800U)] and it's all running smoothly, but I'm having an odd problem I'm trying to figure out.
T 1603108666 18<19fedora_sec18>	What's the odd problem?
T 1603108691 18<19amharris18>	In short, whether at high loads or idling, the system will eventually and intermittently crash to a black screen.  I'm not sure if it's GNOME, but it seems to be a fairly messy state.  If I press the power button (to go into suspend), it'll then spit out errors in a text interface, but I basically have to hard reset [at least so far].
T 1603108707 18<19fedora_sec18>	Are you using KDE?
T 1603108716 18<19amharris18>	Nope.  GNOME; bog-standard Workstation.
T 1603108725 18<19amharris18>	on Wayland (and Btrfs).
T 1603108749 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: can you switch to tty and check if there is any kernel message / trace ?
T 1603108752 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's a problem with Renior, given it's still fairly recent, or if it's 33; or a combination.
T 1603108780 18<19fedora_sec18>	Ah wayland. Does the computer automatically lock itself? Because I was using Parrot OS and when it tried to lock itself, it would freeze because it didn't have the right thing to lock itself, so I switched off the auto locking and switched the rendering too
T 1603108869 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Yeah, I tried to jump into the logs and system logs sometimes throw a warning of access.  I don't think I've ever 'main'-ed GNOME 3 (and it's been so long since I've played around with a new setup; last Linux workstation was on Debian Wheezy with OpenBox ...yup!).
T 1603108890 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: it also looks like you system doesn't die, it's just the screen going black so you can check the syslog for those
T 1603108896 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: I'm at work right now, but I'll get as much info as I can when I get home.
T 1603108916 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: also: use the sysrq to restart the system if it happens, don't use the power button (but you need to enable the sysrq to do so, they are disabled by default)
T 1603108918 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: hehe, hence my little explanation above. ;-)
T 1603108975 18<26Khaytsus18>	If not suggested yet, try the Xorg (Classic) login vs Wayland.
T 1603108980 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: to enable: echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' > /etc/sysctl.d/sysrq.conf
T 1603109004 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's relevant at all but having never really had more of a business-orientated system before, I didn't really think about 1.2V for the DRAM and got 1.35V 3200MHz memory instead (but not at JEDEC spec and only XMP); listed as compatible but it clocks it down to 2666MHz at 1.2V.  Not sure if that's relevant at all.
T 1603109065 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: that would be a point for the hardware vendor, not for Fedora people I suppose, we can only speculate on that topic :)
T 1603109110 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Albeit a touch embarrassing, I've never actually used SysRq.  Though I get the basics of what it does, what's the reason you're suggesting/requesting I use it to restart the system?
T 1603109135 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: True, true.  Just throwing it out there in case there's an "aha!  I've seen/heard about this before." :-)
T 1603109173 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: with the sysrq equence s u b, you will sync the cache to disk (s), remount everything read only (u), and then reset (b). This is a way of shutting down with less risk of corrupting the file system
T 1603109450 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Ah, fab—just what I like. :-)  I hope that worst case it'd just be a few bits being flipped and not a risk of a borked install [with hard resets]. >.<
T 1603109516 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: without sysrq the chances of having a borked install are much lower I'd say
T 1603109567 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Do you mean 'with'?

T 1612205620 18<28Xenorites18>	Hello; could use some advice. I got a new GPU - switched from an nVidia to AMD; I have removed all the nvidia diver packages, and have installed the xorg-x11-drv-amdgpu package. However, for some reason, when I try to log in (to the console, no DM installed) I am immediately logged back out now.
T 1612205692 18<26quippy18>	hi I was wondering if anybody knew how to get a application icon to display in the dock when you manually create a .desktop file to install an app? It shows up in the Gnome Overlay / Activities pane, but not the dock on the left hand side for some reason

T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	Hello, I'd like to report a kind of bug (I guess) on fedora-workstation 33 in conjunction with keepassxc: the issue is already being discussed there: https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/5608 . In short, the search field in keepassxc doesn't take any typing input unless keppasxc is started through the terminal with "keepassxc -plateform wayland". The problem is ongoing since about October 2020. For me the
T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	problem disappeared after the updates including the new kernel 5.10.11 until today's update including keepassxc V2.6.4.

T 1612730720 18<20cmurf18>	it does restart on startup already so making it do it again isn't gonna fix things
T 1612730735 18<20cmurf18>	it starts from initramfs, logs, restarts from disk, logs indefinitely
T 1612730758 18<20cmurf18>	so if it's getting stuck on every reboot that's not good
T 1612730762 18<20cmurf18>	this is f33? or rawhide?

T 1612730804 18<20cmurf18>	it just gets stuck?
T 1612730933 18<25jakelazaroff18>	to give a little more context, these are servers on digitalocean from an image i'm building with packer. so basically what happens is a server boots up, gets provisioned, the disk gets saved as an image, and then that becomes the template for new servers

T 1612809522 18<20cmurf18>	ok hmm, well that grubenv file is accepting the change at least
T 1612809576 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah on macs, the thing we use on Fedora for /boot/efi is not the real EFI System partition
T 1612809584 18<20cmurf18>	but a small HFS+ partition
T 1612809598 18<26slop18>	macs. /me washes hands.
T 1612809609 18<20cmurf18>	the reason is for mactel-boot stuff, so that you see a pretty Fedora logo when you boot with option key at the startup chime

T 1612809633 18<25Amgine[m]18>	<nods> I wiped this one so it is only Fedora, which may be the issue?
T 1612809655 18<20cmurf18>	basically there are some files on that HFS+ faux-ESP that make Apple firmware think Fedora's GRUB is actually macos haha
T 1612809661 18<20cmurf18>	but anyway...
T 1612809669 18<26slop18>	hey I saw a post on reddit about about the splash screen for system updates performed via gnome. guys, ive got to tell you. thats a great move. Its something that my parents and other non technical people are COMFORTABLE with.
T 1612809671 18<20cmurf18>	no i don't think so, this is all self contained to Fedora
T 1612809689 18<26slop18>	a lot better than me telling my 70+ year old parents ok open a terminal. now
T 1612809716 18<20cmurf18>	yeah they just get updates automatically really, out of the box
T 1612809728 18<25Amgine[m]18>	kk. Well, thanks for the quick solution, and I will keep you apprised if there are future similar behaviors.
T 1612809731 18<26slop18>	Its a step in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded/outside of technical people updates. and making updates LESS scary so theya re applied.
T 1612809736 18<20cmurf18>	you just reboot and once every week or two (sometimes more often due to firefox or a kernel security fix) you get updates on the reboot
T 1612809742 18<26slop18>	^^
T 1612809779 18<20cmurf18>	Amgine[m]: yeah because the kernel package is responsible for writing that that conf file, and then also updating the grub environment file
T 1612809787 18<20coppice18>	slop: you do realise that it was people who are 70+ who developed the opening of terminal windows?
T 1612809886 18<22akik18>	cmurf: on an 2011 imac, the efi system partition is a normal vfat partition. there's an installer bug that makes it so that you can't install the boot loader in the installer
T 1612809925 18<20cmurf18>	akik: there is a real FAT32 ESP but Apple only uses it for firmware update staging
T 1612809932 18<20cmurf18>	they don't use it for booting and neither does Fedora
T 1612809942 18<22akik18>	cmurf: my machine uses it for booting
T 1612809950 18<26slop18>	coppice, not my farming parents. they didnt have an email address until it was required. I tell them theres NOTHING they can break on fedora that we can either figure out or reload.
T 1612809955 18<22akik18>	i.e. /boot/efi/EFI/fedora is in there
T 1612809972 18<20cmurf18>	akik: lsblk -f | fpaste
T 1612809998 18<20cmurf18>	because the installer, if it knows it's on a mac, will create /boot/efi on HFS+, it will not reuse the FAT32 ESP
T 1612810024 18<20cmurf18>	there is a bug in the f33 installer where it creates both FAT32 and HFS+ partitions, but only uses the HFS+ one for /boot/efi
T 1612810071 18<20cmurf18>	the unused FAT32 volume is left untouched - forever ghosted
T 1612810101 18<22akik18>	cmurf: that's where the installer goes wrong. it should just use the existing esp
T 1612810199 18<22akik18>	cmurf: here's the lsblk https://paste.centos.org/view/7c9d7479
T 1612810257 18<22akik18>	maybe the difference is that i'm using apfs and not hfs
T 1612810273 18<22akik18>	for the macos partition
T 1612810900 18<20cmurf18>	akik: did you modify this after installation?
T 1612810904 18<20cmurf18>	├─sda1 vfat   FAT32 EFI   2860-11F4                               148M    25% /boot/efi
T 1612811004 18<22akik18>	cmurf: no it contains some apple stuff. one thing that i just now remembers was that i use that other boot loader per default, refind
T 1612811024 18<20cmurf18>	that's interesting because Apple had used a 200M FAT32 ESP for a very long time, since the start of EFI with x86 macs
T 1612811056 18<20cmurf18>	Soo it must be that whatever does the test for "is it a mac" isn't working with newer macs? HUH
T 1612811061 18<20cmurf18>	but you said this is a 2011 mac
T 1612811076 18<22akik18>	cmurf: yes
T 1612811090 18<20cmurf18>	my 2009 and 2012 macs both behave the way i've described though
T 1612811095 18<22akik18>	cmurf: my only apple hardware
T 1612811106 18<22akik18>	and it's probably going out of support soon
T 1612811109 18<20cmurf18>	the installer doesn't use FAT32 ESP, it'll only use HFS+ for /boot/efi
T 1612811117 18<22akik18>	why's that?
T 1612811125 18<22akik18>	i have apple's stuff in there
T 1612811138 18<22akik18>	and now also fedora's
T 1612811156 18<20cmurf18>	like i said earlier, it's part of mactel-boot stuff to make it easier for mac users
T 1612811166 18<22akik18>	i can paste the contents if you want
T 1612811185 18<20cmurf18>	originally Fedora also appeared in the Startup panel, but i think Apple broke that part and now only the built-in firmware Boot Manager shows Fedora
T 1612811227 18<20cmurf18>	did you use Custom partitioning? or Advanced-Custom?
T 1612811243 18<22akik18>	if i try to install fedora or centos on it, i'm just getting some weird error like efi system partition can't be of type esp
T 1612811252 18<20cmurf18>	that's correct
T 1612811264 18<22akik18>	then i need to unselect the install boot loader in the installer and after install, install it
T 1612811292 18<20cmurf18>	oh ok so you're just being stubborn and want to do things your way rather than the installer's way :D

T 1612811466 18<22akik18>	i found the solution on redhat's bugzilla
T 1612811497 18<20cmurf18>	you must be doing Custom or Advanced-Custom installation, because that error message only happens in those paths

T 1612811533 18<20cmurf18>	ok and if you create /boot/efi on a mac as Linux HFS+ EFI, you do not get the error you're talking about
T 1612811560 18<19foxide18>	You don't even need to do that. FAT32 EFI works just fine, Apple EFI looks for the fallback bootloader same as UEFI implementations.
T 1612811562 18<20cmurf18>	you only get the error if you try to force it to do something it has a rule against doing
T 1612811572 18<22akik18>	so fedora has decided not to use the common esp on macs as with any other platform?
T 1612811577 18<20cmurf18>	correct
T 1612811581 18<22akik18>	so silly :)
T 1612811588 18<19foxide18>	Fedora didn't decide anything, you're the one doing a custom install.
T 1612811590 18<19foxide18>	YOU decided.
T 1612811598 18<20cmurf18>	dude i just explained why, why are you ignoring that?

T 1612811629 18<20cmurf18>	Because Apple's firmware ignores it except as a final fallback volume
T 1612811641 18<20cmurf18>	we wanted users to see a nice Fedora logo in the built-in boot manager
T 1612811649 18<20cmurf18>	you only get that if the files are on an HFS+ volume

T 1612811792 18<20cmurf18>	let the installer do it all correctly behind the scenes, no customizations
