T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	Hello, I'd like to report a kind of bug (I guess) on fedora-workstation 33 in conjunction with keepassxc: the issue is already being discussed there: https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/5608 . In short, the search field in keepassxc doesn't take any typing input unless keppasxc is started through the terminal with "keepassxc -plateform wayland". The problem is ongoing since about October 2020. For me the
T 1612437946 18<20nh-nh[m]18>	problem disappeared after the updates including the new kernel 5.10.11 until today's update including keepassxc V2.6.4.

T 1612730720 18<20cmurf18>	it does restart on startup already so making it do it again isn't gonna fix things
T 1612730735 18<20cmurf18>	it starts from initramfs, logs, restarts from disk, logs indefinitely
T 1612730758 18<20cmurf18>	so if it's getting stuck on every reboot that's not good
T 1612730762 18<20cmurf18>	this is f33? or rawhide?

T 1612730804 18<20cmurf18>	it just gets stuck?
T 1612730933 18<25jakelazaroff18>	to give a little more context, these are servers on digitalocean from an image i'm building with packer. so basically what happens is a server boots up, gets provisioned, the disk gets saved as an image, and then that becomes the template for new servers
T 1612730942 18<25jakelazaroff18>	so whenever i spin up a server from that image, this happens

T 1612809522 18<20cmurf18>	ok hmm, well that grubenv file is accepting the change at least
T 1612809576 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah on macs, the thing we use on Fedora for /boot/efi is not the real EFI System partition
T 1612809584 18<20cmurf18>	but a small HFS+ partition
T 1612809598 18<26slop18>	macs. /me washes hands.
T 1612809609 18<20cmurf18>	the reason is for mactel-boot stuff, so that you see a pretty Fedora logo when you boot with option key at the startup chime
T 1612809613 18<20cmurf18>	:D
T 1612809633 18<25Amgine[m]18>	<nods> I wiped this one so it is only Fedora, which may be the issue?
T 1612809655 18<20cmurf18>	basically there are some files on that HFS+ faux-ESP that make Apple firmware think Fedora's GRUB is actually macos haha
T 1612809661 18<20cmurf18>	but anyway...
T 1612809669 18<26slop18>	hey I saw a post on reddit about about the splash screen for system updates performed via gnome. guys, ive got to tell you. thats a great move. Its something that my parents and other non technical people are COMFORTABLE with.
T 1612809671 18<20cmurf18>	no i don't think so, this is all self contained to Fedora
T 1612809689 18<26slop18>	a lot better than me telling my 70+ year old parents ok open a terminal. now
T 1612809716 18<20cmurf18>	yeah they just get updates automatically really, out of the box
T 1612809728 18<25Amgine[m]18>	kk. Well, thanks for the quick solution, and I will keep you apprised if there are future similar behaviors.
T 1612809731 18<26slop18>	Its a step in the right direction for becoming a more well rounded/outside of technical people updates. and making updates LESS scary so theya re applied.
T 1612809736 18<20cmurf18>	you just reboot and once every week or two (sometimes more often due to firefox or a kernel security fix) you get updates on the reboot
T 1612809742 18<26slop18>	^^
T 1612809779 18<20cmurf18>	Amgine[m]: yeah because the kernel package is responsible for writing that that conf file, and then also updating the grub environment file
T 1612809787 18<20coppice18>	slop: you do realise that it was people who are 70+ who developed the opening of terminal windows?
T 1612809886 18<22akik18>	cmurf: on an 2011 imac, the efi system partition is a normal vfat partition. there's an installer bug that makes it so that you can't install the boot loader in the installer
T 1612809925 18<20cmurf18>	akik: there is a real FAT32 ESP but Apple only uses it for firmware update staging
T 1612809932 18<20cmurf18>	they don't use it for booting and neither does Fedora
T 1612809942 18<22akik18>	cmurf: my machine uses it for booting
T 1612809950 18<26slop18>	coppice, not my farming parents. they didnt have an email address until it was required. I tell them theres NOTHING they can break on fedora that we can either figure out or reload.
T 1612809955 18<22akik18>	i.e. /boot/efi/EFI/fedora is in there
T 1612809972 18<20cmurf18>	akik: lsblk -f | fpaste
T 1612809998 18<20cmurf18>	because the installer, if it knows it's on a mac, will create /boot/efi on HFS+, it will not reuse the FAT32 ESP
T 1612810024 18<20cmurf18>	there is a bug in the f33 installer where it creates both FAT32 and HFS+ partitions, but only uses the HFS+ one for /boot/efi
T 1612810071 18<20cmurf18>	the unused FAT32 volume is left untouched - forever ghosted
T 1612810101 18<22akik18>	cmurf: that's where the installer goes wrong. it should just use the existing esp
T 1612810199 18<22akik18>	cmurf: here's the lsblk https://paste.centos.org/view/7c9d7479
T 1612810257 18<22akik18>	maybe the difference is that i'm using apfs and not hfs
T 1612810273 18<22akik18>	for the macos partition
T 1612810900 18<20cmurf18>	akik: did you modify this after installation?
T 1612810904 18<20cmurf18>	├─sda1 vfat   FAT32 EFI   2860-11F4                               148M    25% /boot/efi
T 1612811004 18<22akik18>	cmurf: no it contains some apple stuff. one thing that i just now remembers was that i use that other boot loader per default, refind
T 1612811024 18<20cmurf18>	that's interesting because Apple had used a 200M FAT32 ESP for a very long time, since the start of EFI with x86 macs
T 1612811056 18<20cmurf18>	Soo it must be that whatever does the test for "is it a mac" isn't working with newer macs? HUH
T 1612811061 18<20cmurf18>	but you said this is a 2011 mac
T 1612811076 18<22akik18>	cmurf: yes
T 1612811090 18<20cmurf18>	my 2009 and 2012 macs both behave the way i've described though
T 1612811095 18<22akik18>	cmurf: my only apple hardware
T 1612811106 18<22akik18>	and it's probably going out of support soon
T 1612811109 18<20cmurf18>	the installer doesn't use FAT32 ESP, it'll only use HFS+ for /boot/efi
T 1612811117 18<22akik18>	why's that?
T 1612811125 18<22akik18>	i have apple's stuff in there
T 1612811138 18<22akik18>	and now also fedora's
T 1612811156 18<20cmurf18>	like i said earlier, it's part of mactel-boot stuff to make it easier for mac users
T 1612811166 18<22akik18>	i can paste the contents if you want
T 1612811185 18<20cmurf18>	originally Fedora also appeared in the Startup panel, but i think Apple broke that part and now only the built-in firmware Boot Manager shows Fedora
T 1612811227 18<20cmurf18>	did you use Custom partitioning? or Advanced-Custom?
T 1612811243 18<22akik18>	if i try to install fedora or centos on it, i'm just getting some weird error like efi system partition can't be of type esp
T 1612811252 18<20cmurf18>	that's correct
T 1612811264 18<22akik18>	then i need to unselect the install boot loader in the installer and after install, install it
T 1612811292 18<20cmurf18>	oh ok so you're just being stubborn and want to do things your way rather than the installer's way :D

T 1612811466 18<22akik18>	i found the solution on redhat's bugzilla
T 1612811497 18<20cmurf18>	you must be doing Custom or Advanced-Custom installation, because that error message only happens in those paths

T 1612811533 18<20cmurf18>	ok and if you create /boot/efi on a mac as Linux HFS+ EFI, you do not get the error you're talking about
T 1612811560 18<19foxide18>	You don't even need to do that. FAT32 EFI works just fine, Apple EFI looks for the fallback bootloader same as UEFI implementations.
T 1612811562 18<20cmurf18>	you only get the error if you try to force it to do something it has a rule against doing
T 1612811572 18<22akik18>	so fedora has decided not to use the common esp on macs as with any other platform?
T 1612811577 18<20cmurf18>	correct
T 1612811581 18<22akik18>	so silly :)
T 1612811588 18<19foxide18>	Fedora didn't decide anything, you're the one doing a custom install.
T 1612811590 18<19foxide18>	YOU decided.
T 1612811598 18<20cmurf18>	dude i just explained why, why are you ignoring that?

T 1612811616 18<19foxide18>	Are you trying to dual boot?
T 1612811629 18<20cmurf18>	Because Apple's firmware ignores it except as a final fallback volume
T 1612811641 18<20cmurf18>	we wanted users to see a nice Fedora logo in the built-in boot manager
T 1612811649 18<20cmurf18>	you only get that if the files are on an HFS+ volume

T 1612811781 18<20cmurf18>	I admit the error message doesn't really tell you exactly what you need to do - i've argued for a long time that all this bootloader stuff in GUI installers should just go away
T 1612811792 18<20cmurf18>	let the installer do it all correctly behind the scenes, no customizations

That /dev/sda3 partition used to be "the rest of the drive", so about 200gb (its a 250gb drive). I shrunk the partition down to the size it is now. Made another partition (/dev/sda4) which I mounted manually in procfs, and then that unallocated space I'm saving for later. Do you guys know what is up with that

T 1612987719 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	ppavacic, you were told before that a ucraptu on fedora that would be dracut
T 1612987741 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: Why bother?  Because you might be configuring a whole host of advanced networking things that require a separate tool each... and THAT is where nm simplies it.  I don't know that NM is that much "bloat".
T 1612987779 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: But it is ok if YOU don't like it... but others who use more advanced features of it probably love it for how it simplified so much for them.
T 1612987783 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: that's not how problems reduction works. i generally start with the most simple thing and work my way up, not the other way around.
T 1612987812 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: i'm perfectly fine with it on a setup i have physical access to, but on a server i want zero surprises.
T 1612987872 18<25genevino18>	in fact one of the reasons why i heavily use netbsd and alpine for servers.
T 1612987883 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: The problem nm was trying to solve (in my opinion) was to have one tool to configure everything network related... and it was especially nightmarish when you work with a number of different distros.  Not only does nm solve it for one system, but all of the distros that use it (if setup properly).

T 1612987965 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: That would be true if you still continue to use the 14 other tools that are no longer necessary.
T 1612987973 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: it still *IS* nightmarish. i happen to have just written a wrapper script that circumvents dependency on the systemctl command. that's basically exactly the same thing. people trying to force a standard on you without realizing that reality differs.
T 1612987991 18<19dowdle18>	genevino: But so far as new standards go, I'm guessing nm didn't reinvent the backend of configuration, they just speak it... but I'm guessing.

T 1612988093 18<25genevino18>	dowdle: that's correct, but still doesn't justify the whole NM stack for a static ip setup.

T 1613072102 18<20cmurf18>	fyksen: you can use Server dvd or netinstall, Custom or Advanced-Custom UI
T 1613072158 18<20cmurf18>	if you use Custom, there is a partition scheme popup with a Btrfs preset, if you choose that and click the blue text above it to create partitions automatically you'll get the same layout as the "Automatic" install path used on desktop installers
T 1613072217 18<20cmurf18>	Although, hmm :) I'm not certain you get a /home mountpoint on Server no matter the partition scheme
T 1613072218 18<29fyksen18>	Okey, but if I want striped array, is that supported in the installer also?
T 1613072245 18<20cmurf18>	yeah you can do that in Custom or Advanced-Custom
T 1613072249 18<29fyksen18>	/home is not important. Can always fix that later
T 1613072280 18<20cmurf18>	the UI for Custom is, click on /, then on the right there's a Volume(s) option, click on the Modify button under it
T 1613072288 18<20cmurf18>	and you can choose raid0 there
T 1613072316 18<26slop18>	mmmm butter.
T 1613072318 18<20cmurf18>	I'm not certain if you get raid0 metadata and data; or if you get raid0 data and raid1 metadata
T 1613072327 18<20cmurf18>	but you can also fix that after the installation
T 1613072345 18<20cmurf18>	i'll try it - you do want raid1 metadata, even for raid0 data
T 1613072387 18<29fyksen18>	Ahh, okey. Thanks. I will read a bit up about metadata on btrfs.
T 1613072391 18<20cmurf18>	while the system won't survive a full device failure, the file system itself can survive and self-heal still, if there are things like bad sectors, dropped/redirected writes
T 1613072401 18<29fyksen18>	But it makes sense
T 1613072457 18<20cmurf18>	yeah if there's any kind of isolated/limited trouble with one of the devices, at least the fs survives - but of course data is a far larger payload so chances are that's what gets hit by such corruptions
T 1613072467 18<20cmurf18>	and in the raid0 case it pretty much means trouble
T 1613072497 18<20cmurf18>	it really just depends on what the corruption hits, but btrfs will tell you that :D

T 1613074530 18<20cmurf18>	rustysysdev_: very minor point, i probably wouldn't use xfs for /boot because in very rare cases it's possible for it to be inconsistent from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613074559 18<20cmurf18>	bootloader can't do journal replay is what it comes down to
T 1613074603 18<20cmurf18>	xfs in particular only guarantees the journal contains metadata updates on fsync, not that the journal is flushed
T 1613074705 18<28rustysysdev_18>	cmurf, Interesting, and thanks! Its seems to be the default for Fedora33 when generating a new BRTFS configuration via the GUI i wonder why.. Ill look into changing it!
T 1613074724 18<20cmurf18>	humm
T 1613074746 18<20cmurf18>	i wonder if that's part of Server related kickstart stuff
T 1613074793 18<20cmurf18>	i think originally it was ext4 /boot and xfs /
T 1613074805 18<20cmurf18>	maybe it got changed to xfs for both
T 1613074827 18<20cmurf18>	and now with btrfs preset it defers to the Server kickstart for /boot
T 1613074854 18<28rustysysdev_18>	not sure, but if the bootloader cannot indeed do replay then it indeed should be changed.. I wonder if the bootloader can somehow do replay now?
T 1613074864 18<20cmurf18>	nope
T 1613074868 18<20cmurf18>	not for ext4 either
T 1613074964 18<20cmurf18>	it's just to complicated to have two different places to maintain journal replay code, so far no one is interested in doing it
T 1613074997 18<20cmurf18>	in no particular order, use FAT, ext2, ext4 with journaling disabled, or btrfs
T 1613075003 18<26slop18>	This community here is so nice. Ive been in other channels that people are very..... impatient? snipe-ish?
T 1613075026 18<28rustysysdev_18>	I have been using netinstaller for everything since fedora 21.. possibly before then.. but cannot remember. I remember it used to provision ext2, and then ext4, and now even on my 32 install its xfs
T 1613075035 18<20cmurf18>	i can't remember either
T 1613075065 18<20cmurf18>	yeah almost no chance you run into this, because also dracut does an FIFREEZE/FITHAW on /boot on xfs
T 1613075085 18<20cmurf18>	that flushes the journal to the fs, so that the bootloader has a consistent view
T 1613075111 18<20cmurf18>	so this teeny tiny issue probably won't ever happen in the usual case
T 1613075120 18<20cmurf18>	s/usual case/normal usage/
T 1613075195 18<20cmurf18>	also systemd does a umount of /boot which also flushes journal to fs metadata
T 1613075272 18<28rustysysdev_18>	so not a huge issue, in that the file system should never see an unclean state.. but probably better to switch.. I think ill move it to ext4 with journaling disabled.
T 1613075273 18<20cmurf18>	so the only time you might get in trouble is: (a) modify anything related to the current default boot files, such as /boot/loader/entries files (b) reboot -f or sysrq+b or crash
T 1613075289 18<20cmurf18>	not a huge issue

T 1613076296 18<20cmurf18>	haha
T 1613076318 18<20cmurf18>	i dunno the whole story but someone filed a bug, they had /boot as a directory on an XFS /
T 1613076341 18<20cmurf18>	and something was consistently preventing the usual behavior of / being remounted ro
T 1613076364 18<20cmurf18>	/ can't be unmounted on a reboot, but it should be remounted ro, which also flushes the journal
T 1613076410 18<20cmurf18>	even though it wasn't remounted ro, the system was rebooted anyway rather than hang (which we could have a lot of legit debate about what to do about this)
T 1613076437 18<20cmurf18>	but the consequence was, the bootloader didn't see the changes in /boot - it saw a 0 byte grub.cfg following kernel upgrades
T 1613076443 18<26slop18>	haha :) very impressed no joke
T 1613076448 18<20cmurf18>	so it face planted
T 1613076487 18<20cmurf18>	and if all you did was boot from a usb rescue, and mount the file system, journal replay happened, the grub.cfg was fine
T 1613076508 18<20cmurf18>	but if you mounted root ro,nologreplay - it was 0 bytes
T 1613076534 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah, fixing it was just mount normally and then reboot, grub works now
T 1613076557 18<20cmurf18>	but the key thing is you want to prevent these things in the first place :)
T 1613076563 18<26slop18>	nice, I wouldve missed that completely. nice work
T 1613076573 18<20cmurf18>	oh it drove me nuts
T 1613076600 18<20cmurf18>	and it turns into a bit of head butting upstream, like the bootloader doing the wrong thing, the file system doing the wrong thing, on and on
T 1613076608 18<20cmurf18>	you know, finger pointing
T 1613076637 18<20cmurf18>	as it turns out, everyone is right but that doesn't solve the problem
T 1613076720 18<24d9k18>	if that would happen with bls you would just not get the entry for the next kernel i think
T 1613076738 18<24d9k18>	since all the bits are generated from the conf at /loader and grub.cfg is untouched
T 1613076739 18<20cmurf18>	i think so
T 1613076742 18<24d9k18>	should be untouched..
T 1613076745 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076747 18<20cmurf18>	good point
T 1613076766 18<20cmurf18>	this might be totally obsoleted by bls
T 1613076769 18<26slop18>	cmurf, I get that completely -  thank you
T 1613076819 18<20cmurf18>	the last write should be to write a new bls file, and it should either be present or not
T 1613076850 18<20cmurf18>	from the perspective of the bootloader
T 1613076857 18<24d9k18>	if a new grub.cfg is moved in its place to replace it and only the metadata update happened then you would be in the same situation
T 1613076884 18<24d9k18>	even if it is the same data just written over
T 1613076896 18<20cmurf18>	right
T 1613076907 18<20cmurf18>	in that case it's involving rename
T 1613076932 18<24d9k18>	chattr +i grub.cfg problem solved hehe
T 1613076951 18<20cmurf18>	so you can end up with 0 length files because the journal contains the rename, not yet flushed to the fs itself which is all the bootloader sees
T 1613076969 18<24d9k18>	yeah
T 1613076987 18<20cmurf18>	in practice, nothing changes grub.cfg anymore but a sysadmin
T 1613077106 18<20cmurf18>	maybe one day i'll try to sabotage this again and see if i can break anything
T 1613077136 18<20cmurf18>	dm-log-writes would be a better way to do it
T 1613077179 18<20cmurf18>	it breaks down all changes so we can see whether a crash at each step results in an undesirable/unmanagable view of the filesystem
T 1613077292 18<20cmurf18>	dm-log-writes is really cool, one of the btrfs maintainers wrote that for power fail testing, now the xfstests that are used by all linux file systems includes tests using dm-log-writes

T 1613078418 18<20cmurf18>	the idea of journal replay is to avoid lengthy fsck, it doesn't inherently make the fs safer
T 1613078439 18<20cmurf18>	and an unclean shutdown means ext4 gets an fsck, it's pretty fast on a dedicated /boot volume

T 1613085398 18<20cmurf18>	this is one reason why i use subvolumes/rw snapshots to isolate things
T 1613085419 18<20cmurf18>	it's still shared trees for everything but that file tree
T 1613085470 18<20cmurf18>	but if the corruption can be trimmed out by just deleting a subvolume, it just dereferences nodes that contain the problem rather than cow
T 1613085483 18<20cmurf18>	if it read it, to cow, it'd hit the corruption and faceplant
T 1613085488 18<20cmurf18>	just like in qemu
T 1613085507 18<20cmurf18>	but oh ignore what i just wrote - the root file system would go read only because of this
T 1613085540 18<20cmurf18>	the question is whether the write time tree check stopped it before it was written out, and i think the answer to that is yes

T 1613085774 18<24d9k18>	since this is a quick reprocuder i imagine it wouldnt be too hard to debug, since reproducing is always the hard bit

T 1613085795 18<20cmurf18>	well the backing file is memory so this can be that bug hmm
T 1613085807 18<24d9k18>	i think so
T 1613085822 18<24d9k18>	or what you mean
T 1613085829 18<20cmurf18>	so
T 1613085868 18<20cmurf18>	consider a more persistent virt-manager setup, raw backing file, and you use a cache mode that supports o_direct like none
T 1613085879 18<20cmurf18>	or directsync
T 1613085907 18<20cmurf18>	and if that raw backing file is on btrfs, and is datacow, your raw backing file is being checksummed
T 1613085945 18<20cmurf18>	o_direct allows file systems to do inflight changes of buffered data, there's no enforcement for stable writes
T 1613085982 18<20cmurf18>	so we get a write and checksum for the write in the raw file; and a subsequent inflight write changes the data does not update the csum and we start seeing csum errors
T 1613086044 18<20cmurf18>	part of why the default is nodatacow for raw/qcow2 files on btrfs with libvirt, and the default cache mode is writeback
T 1613086048 18<20cmurf18>	problem doesn't happen with either of those
T 1613086063 18<20cmurf18>	i have a bug for that

T 1613114465 18<22mkowalski_18>	Good morning
T 1613114512 18<22mkowalski_18>	Question about reporting such a problem - dmesg for `input` shows a device name with the typo; what would be the best place to report such an issue?
T 1613114547 18<22mkowalski_18>	Does it belong under xlibinput or is it something more for the OS itself?
T 1613114599 18<24chrisawi18>	are you sure it's not coming from the device itself? what is the typo exactly?
T 1613114646 18<22mkowalski_18>	Ok, so yesterday I've been updating kernel and some other packages. Before I had `'Logitech MX Ergo Mouse'` which now became `'Logitech MX Ergo Multi-Device Trackball '` <-- note the space at the end
T 1613114666 18<22mkowalski_18>	Given that it's the same device, it's not something that would be coming from it I guess (otherwise why would the name change)
T 1613115388 18<24chrisawi18>	maybe the logitech unifying receiver got a firmware update via fwupd?
T 1613115438 18<22mkowalski_18>	It's a bluetooth device and no fw update happened in between
T 1613115448 18<22mkowalski_18>	https://pastebin.com/raw/phbLsLun <-- some info if anything would help here, but I doubt
T 1613115469 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the bluetoothctl perspective its name is only "MX Ergo", so I wonder where exactly the full name comes from
T 1613115588 18<22mkowalski_18>	From the update log I see that it's been kernel upgrading to 5.10.13 and libevdev to 1.11.0, so I wonder if that could be coming from the latter
T 1613115788 18<22mkowalski_18>	In the kernel itself I have only managed to find this commit -- https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7de843dbaaa68aa514090e6226ed7c6374fd7e49 -- but it does not seem to be included in 5.10.13, thus probably irrelevant
T 1613125780 18<24mrvenkman18>	Hi. Using Gnome boxes - I have found that deleting the box via the right click menu, there is no warning, but there is a "undo delete" that pops up straight away.
T 1613125854 18<24mrvenkman18>	Clicking on "undo delete" doesn't undo deleting the box. It is deleted. LUCKILY I knew this behaviour and backed up the image. However, restoring the images into ./local/gnome-boxes/images - the option to use that box still isn't available. I presume I need to also restore some meta data.
T 1613125874 18<24mrvenkman18>	Anyone know where this meta data is normally stored and what it needs to contain?

T 1613126148 18<24mrvenkman18>	" Click the X on the confirmation notification if you are sure you have deleted the correct boxes. Or click UNDO if you made a mistake. "
T 1613126191 18<24mrvenkman18>	Fedora 33 - clicking undo definitely doesn't undo it. If you click undo, then close gnome boxes and reopen gnome boxes, the image is gone.

T 1613155064 18<20cmurf18>	no, if you do it without -o, it only modifies the command line options in bls snippets - whether BIOS or UEFI

T 1613155119 18<20cmurf18>	but what's really happening when you change command line options is, the bls snippets get modified
T 1613155177 18<20cmurf18>	the bls snippets contain all knowledge about each boot entry, the grub.cfg is intended to be GRUB specific stuff

T 1613155493 18<20cmurf18>	so you can do it that way or create separate bls snippets for each subvolume you want to boot, give them their own title and whatever

T 1614106430 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	It seems to happen every time I play a game with OpenGL graphics. Mindustry, Minetest, Colobot, GZDoom.

T 1614106530 18<20cmurf18>	journalctl -b is the current boot log
T 1614106555 18<20cmurf18>	journalctl -b-1 is the previous one, and you can add -k to see just kernel messages

T 1614106756 18<20cmurf18>	anyway it'd be useful to know where the journals stop
T 1614106775 18<20cmurf18>	i.e. journalctl -b-1 -k --no-pager, and then try -b-2, then -b-3
T 1614106791 18<20cmurf18>	because if they stop before logging the problem, then the journal isn't much help figuring it out
T 1614106842 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	Looks like -b-3 happened before a crash

T 1614107420 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	do you think it might be an oom?
T 1614107439 18<24Copenhagen_Bram18>	i mean, do you think it might be out of memory or something? Maybe I should try sysrq f next time it crashes
T 1614107455 18<20cmurf18>	bug also that seems like the wrong boot because the start is Feb 23 10:57:45 and the end is Feb 23 11:00:17

T 1614304772 18<20plarsen18>	Your error indicates that for SOME reason Windows cares how the hypervisor stores the virtual disk.
T 1614304802 18<20plarsen18>	I'm not a Windows guy - haven't run it for more than a decade, so I'm not sure if there are tricks to make Windows run as a VM - it should not care. That said, using a Directory is quite common
T 1614304828 18<20plarsen18>	So be sure the directory exists and is accessible to qemu. When you create the VM, use "custom" disk, and pick the right disk domain.
T 1614304844 18<20plarsen18>	You then "manually" create the disk, and virtual manager will assign it to the VM
T 1614304854 18<20plarsen18>	(manually create it by hitting the big +)
T 1614304912 18<20plarsen18>	If your Windows somehow thinks it need full access to a raw device, my guess is that Windows wants to own your hardware perhaps because it's not meant to be used on virtual machines. In that case my advice is simple "don't".
T 1614304969 18<27Sokel18>	It shouldn't be trying to use it as a raw device. I've never had that happen choosing windows for a VM.
T 1614304982 18<28linuxmodder18>	solicito,  coming in late what is the error ?
T 1614304995 18<20plarsen18>	The default storage type is "Filesystem Directory". Never had an issue with it - EVER. I "dir disk" doesn't exist, but you can definitely provide raw disk access to a VM
T 1614304995 18<28linuxmodder18>	and confirming windows is the guest vm on fedora host yes?
T 1614305007 18<27solicito18>	yes
T 1614305022 18<27Sokel18>	So you're making a new VM, you attach a disk, and the windows installer doesn't see the disk?
T 1614305035 18<27solicito18>	when installing the vm, windows is not able to find a disk to install the os
T 1614305049 18<27Sokel18>	Then you need the virtio scsi driver.

T 1616061884 18<26n0ps1ed18>	so maybe what you should be doing is just installing R, and tinytex and not worrying about the texlive deps (unless they conflict) and explore the options from R to use tinytex. i have not used R, but that would be the path i would try

T 1616529182 18<22Yourmomuwu[m]18>	can someone explain what "Software" program in Fedora GNOME is? Is it like helper for dnf? or is it it's own thing? is it like pamac for pacman?
T 1616529210 18<22Yourmomuwu[m]18>	or is it like dnfdragora but different
T 1616529319 18<19dowdle18>	Yourmomuwu[m]: It's a software manager that only manages some software.... mostly GNOME related... and mostly GUI-related stuff.  It is not a general purpose package manager.
T 1616529384 18<19dowdle18>	Yourmomuwu[m]: It also does updates what is considered the correct way these days... downloads everything and if needed will reboot the computer into an upgrade mode... do the upgrade and then give the graphical login back.  With dnf running inside of a GUI (unless under screen or tmux), there is always the risk of crashing something and messing up your package manager run.
T 1616529388 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	and its packagekit
T 1616529447 18<20cmurf18>	yeah Software uses PackageKit which I think is using libdnf to manipulate the rpm database but it's not using dnf itself or the dnf metadata cache
T 1616529456 18<22Yourmomuwu[m]18>	but if I download everything GNOME-related with CLI dnf, I'm also good to go?
T 1616529459 18<19dowdle18>	Yourmomuwu[m]: I don't use GNOME and still run dnf within my desktop environments (either KDE Plasma or XFCE) but I do so in tmux... so if the GUI were to crash, I can hopefully switch to text-based console and pick up where I left off.  I haven't really had my GUI crash in quite a long time, but the posibility exists...and you don't want your package manager to be aborted.

T 1616584466 18<28Gargoyle18>	Hey all. Not a fedora problem directly, but a google search turns up a page in the fedora wiki, so I thought I would ask in here. I've got a system with 4GB RAM and it's using swap-on-zram with a size % of 175 and a mem limit of 75%. This seems a little agressive compared to what the wiki says, does anyone else here have any experience?
T 1616584741 18<28Gargoyle18>	Probably also worth mentioning that the system in question dies a very ungraceful death of swap thrashing followed by a reboot every 2-3 days.

T 1616588224 18<28Gargoyle18>	Thanks Khaytsus. The values have been set by the vendor in /etc/init.d/S00zram. (it's a busybox based system). I've just seen articles ranging from 3:1 compression is possible, to 2.1:1 is average/default. But it's all just numbers in the air unless you have an idea of what the actual contents of the RAM are. If you've got 2Gigs of H.264 video in ram, you are not going to get 3:1 when it gets paged out to zram.
T 1616588251 18<28Gargoyle18>	I just wondered if anyone had any real-world experience with various values.

T 1616611889 18<20cmurf18>	like you'd want to check swap in/out and compare it to page faults, once memory is reduced holding onto compressed anonymous pages it's possible that reclaim goes up i.e. any pages backed by a file like a library or config or binary can just be dropped to free up memory because it can be read back in from the file later
T 1616611907 18<20cmurf18>	so that reading it back in can look a lot like swap thrashing if it gets bad
T 1616611938 18<20cmurf18>	you see that in cases with too little or no swap or with a severly reduced swappiness value
T 1616611959 18<20cmurf18>	so yeah anyway it depends
