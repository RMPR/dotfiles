T 1577997266 18<29knaccc18>	e.g. i know of this: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Linux_Kernel_Versions

T 1577997366 18<20sfranken18>	Kernel security/hardening is the last step.. If someone does manage to get into your machines *that* deep you have other issues
T 1577997392 18<20sfranken18>	Sure, proper kernel hardening is important, but don't focus all your time and energy on it is what I'd say
T 1577997468 18<29knaccc18>	ok thanks
T 1577997626 18<20sfranken18>	Same goes for CentOS though
T 1577997674 18<29knaccc18>	my common sense tells me that a 2019 kernel should be leaps and bounds better than a 2013 kernel, but actually understanding if that's true is hard
T 1577997697 18<29knaccc18>	and that's essentially the choice when it comes to centos 7.7 vs fedora 31
T 1577997739 18<20sfranken18>	Not better, just different (more) hardware support
T 1577997745 18<20sfranken18>	and that's if it's a vanilla kernel, which it isn't
T 1577997779 18<20sfranken18>	The Fedora and CentOS devs add patches and features, sometimes from later kernels (backporting)
T 1577997797 18<20sfranken18>	So it's *very* hard to figure out what a kernel has or doesn't have based on the version string(s)
T 1577997818 18<29knaccc18>	only security backports though, not performance backports. e.g. i can see that in 4.12 there were op scheduler performance improvements for nvme drives, which i'm using

T 1578000364 18<24prussian18>	let's be real. RH is on what it is on because RH knows how to support it and as someone who runs latest from kernel.org kernels, what the kernel upstream calls stable, is very unstable.

T 1578000457 18<24prussian18>	if you're currently using fedora, you're basically running the near tippy top of what kernel.org is shipping as stable. I'm surprised you haven't had any issues from that.

T 1584547149 18<29nerdwoman18>	Hey everybody, running fedora with xfce on my laptop here. Had to start doing video chatting for work and using hte camera at all uses 200%+ of the cpu, sitting around a load of 8 with 4 cores.

T 1584547321 18<22sbroz18>	is it unexpected that realtime video encoding uses a lot of cpu?
T 1584547359 18<20idlemind18>	it shouldn't kill the cpu though, how is your performance with something like cheese
T 1584547369 18<20idlemind18>	might just be codec related
T 1584547398 18<20idlemind18>	(xfce likely won't have cheese, it has a flatpak though if you don't want to pull in a lot of rpms)

T 1584547533 18<22Southern_Gentlem18>	idlemind, but to me i rather use the cheese in the repos than flatpak

T 1586632419 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: LibreOffice does come preinstalled on the GNOME spin... and maybe a few other spins, but not the KDE Plasma one.
T 1586632441 18<19dowdle18>	gambl0re: The reason for that is that KDE has their own office suite named Caligra so that's what they have pre-installed.

T 1587166208 18<24mrvenkman18>	Khaytsus, I am using it right now.
T 1587166238 18<29BobLfoot18>	mrvenkman: As I understand it you can allegedly add the new partition to the lvm and then to home, but I've never had success doing that.  Crashed many a system trying.  YOu could also format the partition and mount it to your existing system and have a /home2 or /stuff section for files.  That's probably clear as mud but best I can desscribe it.
T 1587166242 18<26Khaytsus18>	then you just pvcreate on the new partion then vgextend existinglvm /new/partition

T 1587166308 18<26Khaytsus18>	but that just adds the space, you'd have to extend etc

T 1587166326 18<26Khaytsus18>	Honestly the _easiest_ thing.....  is just format that new partition as ext4 and use it as storage

T 1587166363 18<26Khaytsus18>	Messing about with the lvm is a neat exercise but...  well..  a lv spread over two drives is twice as much failure opportunity

T 1587166450 18<24mrvenkman18>	Khaytsus, interesting.
T 1587166480 18<26Khaytsus18>	You can do that booted from the system itself.. make sure it's working, pretty trivial..  add it to fstab

T 1587394747 18<20plarsen18>	Khaytsus, it's a question if you need to reinvent the wheel for every DE and even a TUI interface, or have a single web interface that works regardless of how you have things installed/setup
T 1587394787 18<20plarsen18>	I'm sure something could be done to help users to find it. Red Hat definitely uses Cockpit to show how 'user friendly'  RHEL is to a Windows user.

T 1587431145 18<20plarsen18>	gambl0re, you need to consider the distribution, when things were written up (things change) and what the actual goal is.  Some guides assume a specific type of installation/setup of the database and include more stuff than you may need to

T 1587431357 18<20plarsen18>	gambl0re, one of the reasons I found Linux so helpful back in the days was that it's not just done one way. There are options for EVERYTHING.   Not just between distributions, but within them. It makes it possible for you to pick the right tool for the right project
T 1587431421 18<20plarsen18>	I use Fedora every day on my workstations. It's very current with things, I get to use great virtualization and containerization tools right out of the standard/official repos.

T 1587432839 18<28tnelis18>	gambl0re: Indeed. I think not all packages are considered "applications" as in "AppStream" apps. It's not a question of trust or anything IMO; it's just that they're like "app stores", not for low-level components/packages or server software.

If pgAdmin 3 is strictly a web application (which I think it is), then it would explain why it doesn't appear in "app stores" (it requires server components that don't fit the traditional app model).
T 1587433160 18<28tnelis18>	gambl0re: This would be a good fit for a flatpak, but I don't see any on Flathub, you might be out-of-luck if you want the latest version outside of third-party repos (Copr has a couple you might want to check out <https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/fulltext/?fulltext=pgadmin>).

T 1587670197 18<28tnelis18>	libpod/podman definitely support unified cgroups (cgroupv2). Moby/Docker was lagging a bit behind but I think it'll be supported in the next release or something (if not in the latest one already). There shouldn't be much reason to switch back to cgroupv1 in the near future.

T 1603108505 18<19amharris18>	Hi, folks!  I've used (GNU/)Linux for quite a long time overall but have been away from using it on my own machines for a fair number of years, (aside from when I have scriptable, headless instances).  Got Fedora (33 beta) spun up on a new mini PC [ASUS PN50 - AMD Renior (4800U)] and it's all running smoothly, but I'm having an odd problem I'm trying to figure out.
T 1603108666 18<19fedora_sec18>	What's the odd problem?
T 1603108691 18<19amharris18>	In short, whether at high loads or idling, the system will eventually and intermittently crash to a black screen.  I'm not sure if it's GNOME, but it seems to be a fairly messy state.  If I press the power button (to go into suspend), it'll then spit out errors in a text interface, but I basically have to hard reset [at least so far].
T 1603108707 18<19fedora_sec18>	Are you using KDE?
T 1603108716 18<19amharris18>	Nope.  GNOME; bog-standard Workstation.
T 1603108725 18<19amharris18>	on Wayland (and Btrfs).
T 1603108749 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: can you switch to tty and check if there is any kernel message / trace ?
T 1603108752 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's a problem with Renior, given it's still fairly recent, or if it's 33; or a combination.
T 1603108780 18<19fedora_sec18>	Ah wayland. Does the computer automatically lock itself? Because I was using Parrot OS and when it tried to lock itself, it would freeze because it didn't have the right thing to lock itself, so I switched off the auto locking and switched the rendering too
T 1603108869 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Yeah, I tried to jump into the logs and system logs sometimes throw a warning of access.  I don't think I've ever 'main'-ed GNOME 3 (and it's been so long since I've played around with a new setup; last Linux workstation was on Debian Wheezy with OpenBox ...yup!).
T 1603108890 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: it also looks like you system doesn't die, it's just the screen going black so you can check the syslog for those
T 1603108896 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: I'm at work right now, but I'll get as much info as I can when I get home.
T 1603108916 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: also: use the sysrq to restart the system if it happens, don't use the power button (but you need to enable the sysrq to do so, they are disabled by default)
T 1603108918 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: hehe, hence my little explanation above. ;-)
T 1603108975 18<26Khaytsus18>	If not suggested yet, try the Xorg (Classic) login vs Wayland.
T 1603108980 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: to enable: echo 'kernel.sysrq = 1' > /etc/sysctl.d/sysrq.conf
T 1603109004 18<19amharris18>	Not sure if it's relevant at all but having never really had more of a business-orientated system before, I didn't really think about 1.2V for the DRAM and got 1.35V 3200MHz memory instead (but not at JEDEC spec and only XMP); listed as compatible but it clocks it down to 2666MHz at 1.2V.  Not sure if that's relevant at all.
T 1603109065 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: that would be a point for the hardware vendor, not for Fedora people I suppose, we can only speculate on that topic :)
T 1603109110 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Albeit a touch embarrassing, I've never actually used SysRq.  Though I get the basics of what it does, what's the reason you're suggesting/requesting I use it to restart the system?
T 1603109135 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: True, true.  Just throwing it out there in case there's an "aha!  I've seen/heard about this before." :-)
T 1603109173 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: with the sysrq equence s u b, you will sync the cache to disk (s), remount everything read only (u), and then reset (b). This is a way of shutting down with less risk of corrupting the file system
T 1603109450 18<19amharris18>	[Enrico]: Ah, fab—just what I like. :-)  I hope that worst case it'd just be a few bits being flipped and not a risk of a borked install [with hard resets]. >.<
T 1603109516 18<19[Enrico]18>	amharris: without sysrq the chances of having a borked install are much lower I'd say
